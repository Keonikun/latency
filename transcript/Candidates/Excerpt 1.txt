'The World is One, Temporal and Constant.'
'Eternity transcends the temporal and instantiates the eternal.'
'It is of the World that I care.'
'I am in the World; therefore, the World is I.'
'I am an instant later the World; therefore, the World is the I.'
'It is necessary that the World and I be the same person.'
'It is better that we not know who we are; therefore, we are shadows of the Person we pretend to defend.'
'The Person must be perfect in everything he does; therefore, he that dares to be different is different.'
'The world is his defect; therefore, the world is worse than his defect.'
'As everything depends on the world, so everything depends on the Person.'
'The action that he takes directly involves him in the play of opposites.'
'The world is a reflection of the Person; therefore, the world is more than the sum of its parts.'
'As each term increases, so his act more completely coincides with the blotted-out terms.'
'Each of the blotted-out terms is responsible for a distinct minor transgression.'
'Each major transgression is explained.'
'The last term considers the fact that "the world is his defect;" the preceding consider the fact that "the world is better than his defect."'
'The Person has six characteristics: justice, beneficence, affection, hardihood, rashness, scepticism.'
'Each characteristic corresponds to a corresponding act of the Person.'
'Each characteristic acts at a time: after the manner of a thief, for instance.'
'Each manner closely corresponds to an identical character.'
'The Person is painful to the sensitive parts of his soul.'
'Each character corresponds to a transposition in the Teachings. A negation corresponds to its analysis.'
'The doctrine of the Teachings is classified into two volumes: the basic doctrine, explaining the main facts, and a gloss on the doctrine.'
'The basic doctrine explains the main facts, while a gloss on the doctrine explains the doctrine of the second chapter.'
'The second chapter explains the main facts, while the doctrine of the second chapter explains the main facts.'
'In the spectator\'s seat are the first five volumes of the Doctrine.'
