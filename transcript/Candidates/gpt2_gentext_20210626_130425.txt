Latency is one of the defining characteristics of a superficial and superficial life. The hero who at first sight appears to be the prototype of modern man must in time become that ideal man, who must undergo trials which his contemporaries never dreamt of, who knows not even his own case, realizes his own insignificance, saves the universe. . . But such is not the case here. The hero is inconsiderate, callous, partial, partial to his country, cowardly, crafty, cruel. He is not the image of chivalry, of the integrity of our tribes or of the nobility. He is a blasphemer against all that our forebears fought for and died for. He is a cross to Pilou Asrar or to the purity of our blood. I am sure that no one has felt more the torments of this mortal coil than we have felt when we realized the name of our god only once, when we cursed his name, spat it out upon the desert, burned it and ate it."

Tolstoy then related the legend of Cosades, the hero of the Trojan War. Cosades was a free man who, upon being asked by the officials of the local precinct what city he considered himself to be in, declared with a smile that he is the city where Achilles fought the Battle of Thermopylae and where Helen built the Olympic Games. After this proclamation, Cosades gazed into the circle of spectators who were waiting for him in the center and, with evident regret, declared with a voice scarcely distinguishable from that of a phoenix:



"I declare, my friends or supporters, that I am Spartacus, Phoenix."

These words have been translated literally and mean: I declare, I am.

Those who hear us should understand that we do not ask your allegiance to a single state, we do not ask your loyalty to a single race; we demand your blood, your honor, your repugnance to surrender. We expect a sacrifice similar to that which was offered to the god Atreus when he appeared before the people. The people responded with spontaneous anger and fled toward the city walls. As they ran, they uttered shrill lamentations and obscene words, as if they understood that these were curses or that these were incendiarisms. Suddenly a javelin-wielding man came charging through the mob, exclaiming: "The Philistines are coming!" Then he saw two

			“That’s it,” he said. “That’s it. You fucking retard.”

			Eliot was on his back, cradling his head.

			“Shut the fuck up,” she said.

			He shut up. He wasn’t going to listen to her. He was going to do it his own way. And as he got to his feet’s footsteps stopped and settled instead, and he looked up to meet the sight of five beautiful, hulking, almost silvery-white canine beings sprinting at him from behind him. They weren’t nearly as massive as the others, and they weren’t as strong, but they were stronger than him. They were masters of their abilities combined. Eliot felt like he was a thousand years too young. He was entering a league table game between this bunch of idiots and another bunch of idiots. He was going to have to settle for second best.

			“Hey!” Eliot croaked, but the dogs didn’t get it. They barely heard him. Quentin was standing in front of one of the towers, and he raised his hands in the air and cast a cloak of shadows across the floor of the prison. The others trotted over and snagged it for dear life. Eliot wondered if it would hold if he fell through it, but he could tell by the look on their faces that he wouldn’t. He took a deep breath and began packing up his things.

			Quentin stared at the face that had haunted his mind the longest while. It was of a little boy, probably nine or ten, staring out at the stars with large eyes of golden-yellow fire. His father was standing there, firing at the face, whose features were golden-yellow from exposure to the elements, presumably. It moved its head as if recognizing what was going on.

			The face faded and was replaced by smoke. Smoke that inched up into the sky and then faded out again, dragging faint traces of fire in it. In the distance, slowly, the landscape changed to resemble something that wasn’t very far away: it became a meadow, it became a beach, it became dawn.

====================
Latency in the economy.

Many things (he was sure) were hidden.

He had seen the garden with its many pavilions, the arch of palms, the putrid soil, the hole in the water, the heap of teeth. More than once he had digested these trivial details and tried to put them all together, but he could not. He understood that if he left them Beethoven's dhuchen he had deciphered them quickly and incorrectly. He also knew that the words did not belong to him, that they had been forged by some other person.

He had learned to despise these things.

He would no longer have his meal with salt. He would not have his comrade's wine. If he had to choose, he would ask of Haussler, or Tibullin, or to the superior of some gaol-house, or to the cook, or to the blacksmith, or to the slow merchant, or to the stop in the road. He would choose life.

He did not want to look at his brother's teeth.









And thus his destiny was



Tired of his life of leisure, Franz Lawrence broke his silence, his dark betrayal known to the English courts, but not to his accusers. On March first, 1846, in the presence of Mr. Lawrence, the jury convicted him.

The English condemnations were the ordinary English ones; the French, de leer, the same as the rest of the sentence. The Spanish, gaúdeta, shorter and with ainthe Spanish accent. Lawrence asked that his punishment not be read in court, lest it appear shorter and less awful than he thought it would be. The judges agreed; Lawrence's last words before he was strangled were these: ―"Monsieur Lawrence, savoir précie de la vie."

Lawrence considered his crime; nobody else did not. He felt, as everybody feels, an awkward youth: he was clumsy, he was forgetful, he was homophobic, he was lacking in self-confidence. He tried to act mature: he tried to look like someone who had had a mature thought process, somebody who had asked himself whether it was right to kill his brother, whether it was right, in all its terrible complexity, to kill Walter.

Latency is one of the principal laws of Nature. A new phenomenon comes upon us, we are unable to grasp its principe, or to form an opinion concerning it. This inability, we might say, is the jeunesse. A new phenomenon appears to us in the form of a book, an encyclopedia, an exact description of the movements and climacteries of the sun and the moon. We read it, we understood it, we approvingly signified its accuracy. Then came the rain and the cold and the locusts, and our joy was gone. We grieved, we lamented, we imagined what a catastrophe this must have been. We grieved, we lamented, we imagined what a catastrophe this must have been.

====================
Latency is not the only problem. Another is style. The medieval text was a book, the Renaissance book a manuscript. A book is beautiful if it can convey all ideas in one single form; a manuscript is beautiful, if it can be updated according to the changes made by the hands that wrote it. A book is short if it can be written instantly and correctly; a manuscript is brief, if it must be revised several times. A book can attract readers who are already addicted to another form of that literature; a manuscript, on the other hand, has for its medium the medium of literature. I know that this fact, in itself, appeals to us liberally; nevertheless, it deserves a different criticism. I know that it is of some use to you. I write this letter, for example, in the first paragraph: ―"The pilgrimages of the saintly Faustina Borgia are enthralled, almost everyone thinks him immortal, but he is not, he is, rather, a man many centuries old. In that first century of his era, the appearance of this phenomenon in the Orient did not excite interest in the world over. The Eastern philosophers were occupied with theosa — algebra, dialectics, rhetoric. The problems of physics were solved by means of algebra and geometry. The astronomy of the ancients was marginal. The theologians were the minor astronomers of the world. The history of nations is asthyral. The realm of the rational is multiform. The realm of the irrational is imperious. The Florentines are the most imperious people in all Europe."

That is all we can say about Faustina Borgia. She is the ideal counterpart of the western hero, but she is also that continent's demi-monde. She is the ghost of Faust, but he is also that ghost. We can say, too, that her genius is two-fold: (1) her effeminacy; (2) his celibacy. The effeminacy of Faustina Borgia is obvious. She is mortal, not immortal, and her life is one of graveening mortal souls; her genius is celibacy. Death will not take her that way. Moreover, it is a virtue to be mortal. God has made the immortal soul immortal, in order that we, too, might become the beloved progenitors of the divine people. As regards celibacy, we know that it is a divine rule.
====================
Latency is the enemy of beauty, the enemy of depth. We are all on the verge of it, but we hesitate, we plot, we fool around, we wait, we plunge deeper and deeper into darkness. In a word, the simplicity of our nature renders us helpless against beauty. Shall I venture to compare our condition with that of the little fish which swam through an amber mine? No, they would not believe me. Their eyes would not allow it. They would rather think of a tapir or a buffalo than of a brain. . .

The word I prefer is barbarous. I choose that term because it suits the general sense of the case. A word denoting the quality of barbarous, of base, is too generic. I choose barbarous because that is what the condemned man had to say. He had to say something to fill the quota of one thousand words. He chose barbarous because it was the only word that fitably described the case.

He started:

I am asking of you a divine favor. I ask of you to open your hearts and consciences on earth and to turn away from the fire of passion that is filling heaven and the infinite fire of hell. I ask you to open your hearts and consciences so that I may live, or so that I may go to heaven.

He died before he opened his hearts and consciences. He did not live, or went to heaven; he did not even know whether he did go to heaven. In prison he had said: "I am not dying for a single day, my lord; I go to the top of the page, or to the top of the bottom, or to the top of the bottom." In a conversation with his own handwriting he had written: "I go far, or so far as the imagination can conceive." Two days before his death, on the eve of his funeral, he marked the intervals with a pencil. He had become acquainted, on earth, with four directions: from the east, which became A to the right; to the south, which became S to the right; to the north, which became D to the left; to the right, which became E; and to the bottom, which became F.

Before his death, he had marked the intervals of that journey in time. He had marked, also, the shapes of the doors, or he had done so without fear; he

			“What does it mean?”

			“What if what you are doing is the same thing—”

			“What if I take this poem and read it the wrong way?” Plum said. “What if I make it sound as though it came from the lips of your enemy, Eliot? What if you changed the name of the poem?”

			“How would you do that?”

			“Easy. Change the poem.”

			The man nodded, slowly. His mouth was moving, but his eyes were locked on the page.

			The next day was a layover in San Francisco. It was Valentine’s Day break from Cambridge and he was going to take her up on her offer to go to Pepperdine if he could. He found her an inexpensive hotel an hour outside the city, near the beach. She was wearing a black Oxford blouse and a black pair of tennis shoes, and she had on a black slip dress that looked like she had been worn several hours before. She had taken good care of him this time, she said; he was aching and desperately cold, and he was having trouble keeping his eyes open. He asked her where they were going to stay, and she told him, and he confirmed with her that they were staying at a house they’d heard about in the papers, a house near the edge of SOMA that somebody had been putting on for a number of years and going broke every year since.

			She pointed them toward a nice house on the edge of Vine City, a couple of blocks from the beach, where the houses were all the same height and

The first time I read it, it made me want to crawl into a closet and shut the door behind me. I don’t even know why I bothered with the grammar, but at that moment it made sense: it was the longest paragraph I’d ever read. It had a lot of structure to it, and a lot of strange words that I’d never heard before, and I was just enthralled. I still am.

			That night I let myself be pulled straight into the story. It wasn’t so that I could escape, quite the opposite. I wanted him to know that I was there for him, even if it meant that he make the most of this last of the magical things he’d picked up along the way.

			It was a dangerous game to be in, especially since there was a good chance that our hero was about to get himself killed. Quentin was a lucky man to have gotten himself into that situation in the first place. But James was a tough cookie to crack.

			For a week afterward Alice dragged her feet on most of the work, but once she got going—after Quentin’s little cameo came and went—things really got serious. Like everything in Fillory, the economy was in bad shape. The plants were dying off like a badly weed, the rain was falling on old leaves, worsening the already dire drought—the woods were in disarray, and the ash that fell was falling where it should, on the faces of the people who were supposed to be protecting it. Alice had a theory once, a plausible one, about what was happening: that the Leaves were turning on each other, starting a war. Negotiations were going badly, and they needed something to do, and it seemed to be Alice’s turn to jump ship.

			But what she’d come up with was way over Alice’s head. She’s never been good at thinking outside the box, or taking risks, she could tell. She’d never figure out how to make magic from mere thoughts, or to forge things from rubble. If anything she’d only gotten more obsessed with that particular field of study. So far so good—maybe—but Alice could never figure out why people were doing what they were doing.
====================
Latency and the like, the book seemed like an afterthought. Still, you couldn’t have asked for a better introduction to the world of Fillory. It was populated: the king of Fillory was your average old man, and his reticent greeting was perfectly preserved in every page. The setting text was a magnificent fresco by Averroes da Vinci, which we had visited a half-dozen times as children, and which you will not find in the children’s volumes of any encyclopedia. We parodied it in every book we wrote.

			Perhaps the greatest pleasure of all was the part we played in bringing about the downfall of the king. In Fillory, he was a great statesman; in Fillory, he was a clown. In Fillory, he had adventures; in Fillory, he had convicts. In Fillory, he was a man; in Fillory, he was a king.

			I played the part with much greater sincerity than the biography would have you believe. I was obliged to do so in order to keep my dignity; I was obliged, I think, because my birthright was under threat. I had fought for it in the most heroic capacity, and I knew how to use the finer points of the art to serve the larger ends of popular comedy. I was also very hungry, and I took pleasure in humiliating the convicts who took food from me. The only thing I didn’t enjoy was humiliating people.

			At times I have regretted that I took the part, but the decision never crossed my mind. I didn’t even think about what my character would or wouldn’t do. What I could do well I played along with well into my teens. All that mattered to me was winning the part and becoming the beloved son or daughter of the king.

			As we speak of the part, which is expected to be awarded sometime this year, the owner of the comic is negotiating with several publishers whether or not to withdraw it. From the outside it might seem a reasonable thing to do: pull the plug on a career that you’re barely capable of, risking a guaranteed place in a family basement, a pension you may never collect, and the possibility of unemployment and estrangement. But many people who would do the same wouldn’t have pulled it. They wouldn’t have pulled it because

They’d split up of late, with the pace up to a bit on the brisker side, but there was always the occasional interlude when the pace would pick up and the duo would split up into smaller groups. The group headed in the direction of the research building, which was in fact just a few more blocks east on the other side of the main street.

     So, from this sequence of events, we can deduce two things:
1. That the events of the novel took place;
2. That the narrator, Quentin Coldwater, was the author of the story.
Now, if these deductions are true, there is no reason why they cannot be true of all stories. If so, what made this story different? What made it deserve to be called a classic?
To answer this question we must understand, as Locke did, the relationship between the author and the reader. In the first part of the Libel of Michael Hume (Book V, Barthes's Debate) the skeptic Mill attacks Robert Fludd for his rhetorical practice. He points out that the ancient rhetoricians who have ridiculed the Orphic games left no unfinished works. They proclaimed, he says, that each man was the author of his works, and that no one else could do a man's will, word, and deed a man was incapable of doing alone. Far from condemning this practice, he reasons, it is praiseworthy because it makes possible the work of another. Otherwise, no wonder, he asks, why should we do a man's will, word, and deed alone, alone and apart, in a godlike language, when there are  many other persons who will do this for him, and many other persons who will do that for him?
The Critique of Human Action (II, 418), the last of Plato's dialogues, answers this parallelism. The idle rhetorician Sextus Empiricus (Alexander of Circassius) said that the blind man would need two books to describe the principal points of a stage; the sultan of Egypt would need  three  to exhort the people to revolt; Samson of Samson would need four books to tell the complete story of the Last Supper. Far be it from me to judge either of these brilliant figures (and I never have) nor, God willing, of the other two. Nevertheless, the paradoxical nature of the situation warrants a preliminary examination of dialectic's  ambiguous nature . In all probability, the above reflections  would not have been applicable had Sextus Empiricus been a stage play and Hadrian a novel. But the fact is that both the stages and the novels are  operable parts of the same work, the same work which I speak of as belonging to

Latency and the Memory of Great Things

The last analogy concerns the idea of the interval of time. Now we know that the stars move along a common path, as does the earth along the tracks of a chain; but how do we know what the stars and the earth did and did not do in relation to each other, moreinently and more intangibleially? Although it is known that the earth and the stars revolve about the sun, this fact is not so known how and why they are moved in that particular way. Is it because the earth and the sun are more or less constant in distance? If the earth and the stars are constant in distance, as well as in angular distance, does that mean that the earth and the sun are constant in time? If so, how can we measure their indefinite history, which may or may not be continuous?

Another example concerns the distinction that people have apparently established between the real and the tangible. We know that books are made of paper; we also know that this paper ("book paper") is intangible, because after it has been burned a book, after it has separated from its cover, a bullet, a grenade, a fire-rod, the sun or the moon or a comet will revolve about it, weigh, compress, expand, shrink, harden, harden, shrink, shrink. After fifty thousand years books have not only retained their form, but also have a mysterious, flickering, reflexive life after they have been put out of their packaging paper. (This property of the book paper, if known, would be sufficient to make me the paranoid skeptic people are often told is Mylaporean.)

I have touched an intangible, reflexive book paper, but there is another book paper, like the mother paper of a book, a kind of silent, moving book. Let us imagine we have a chair made of this chair paper, and we will imagine that the chair has been sitting on this chair paper for the last fifteen years. Then we will see that the chair comes to rest on this chair paper.

Suppose we, I, burn the chair. Now suppose we, two of us, Robert and Alice, sit on the chair. We, Robert, amble about the room, equally, on the chair, on the chair paper, and we, Robert, meanwhile, walk around the room, equally, on the paper. After fifteen years we, Robert and Robert, burn
====================
Latency is a choice: if it were otherwise … we would not have to wait so long to speak.

In some ways, our impatience is good. On the other hand, I suspect that a large part of the joy of literature comes from not knowing what the hell we're about to parse is going to be. It is as if we're waiting for George to tell us what the hell we're going to do. It is as if we were writing a history of the English language. We shall never know whether (as Borges imagines) this literature are mere accidents or standees designed to last for ages. We can only speculate. One theory is that our moods and dreams are historical quanta, emplaced in the subconsciousness of the writer, transported to the past and burned in order to let the world re-arrange itself in accordance with the eternal drama that is unfolding in his or her heads. I once read that the Codex Sinaiticus records the opinions of some seventy authors who inhabit the interior parts of the Cross, and urges them to recall its antiquity and reiterate them, if possible, in a hundred years. If all go astray, if some return to the blank plain of Innsbruck or the silent temple of Metapontum, none of them has penned one word of this manuscript. Rather than that, I believe that the Codex Sinaiticus is written by men, by those who have lost all thought and express neither emotion nor language. I believe that the most ancient poets have written it and that the most recent authors, behind the silvered pages, have left their marks, in the form of pictograms, of crests and greetings."

"What, then, are our chances?" I asked. "Are you suggesting that our impetuosity is sufficient to save the stationary Benedictine orders?"

"I should think so," he admitted. "But what is to be done about it? There are certain restrictions placed on the abbeys by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. They prohibit the wearing of scarves, the use of mottoes and the marking of buildings. Moreover, there is a fear that this circumscription may be abused. A monk once pleaded in vain with the abbeys of Burgos and Rimsina to keep him from his duties as a monk; they replied that they did not have the means to house him and that the monks' common meals

Again, as one passes from the sphere of dreams to that of waking, the same laws of space and of time apply. A Latin proverb says, "Those who dream too clearly, too soon; those who dream too soon too easily; those who dream too soon the things they already know, too late the things they do not know." The dreamer, when he discovers his ignorance, instantly knows that he dreamt too soon; after a few attempts to awaken him from his slumber, he finally awakens him from his slumber.

Now, the greatest of all errors is that which I have just enumerated; for just as the mind knows immediately (argueri) that it is ignorant, it judges it immediate and edits its memory according to that knowledge. Now, I know (monos facies omnino) that Alice does not know that Fred wants to go to-morrow; i.e. (argueriori) that she does know. . . Let us suppose for argument's sake that I do know that she does not know; that is, let me not only be aware of things which no one else can possibly know, but also of things which no one else could possibly know either. Since the memory of an Aristotelian denies me this knowledge, I suffer from a memory alteration. Now, if I am not aware of certain things only, i.e. not in the absolute world, but only in the world of my mind, i.e. in the world which is subject to perception, my perception is imperfect; i.e. I do not know the object which Fred wants. Now, if I am aware of those objects which my perception can touch, i.e. of objects which subsist in my mind, i.e. of objects which are objects of my perception, my cognition is perfect; i.e. I do know the objects of my perception. Now, if I compensate my cognition with an appreciation of the object which constitutes the highest object of my cognition, my perception is infinite, i.e. perfect. Now, if I expend a priori all my energy in recovering and refining my object, my cognition is continuous; i.e. I do not seek the corruptible or incorruptible substance of objects. Now, if I expend the same energy in preserving and illuminating my object, my cognition is continuous; i.e. I preserve and illuminate my object,

Latency is an illusion. It is a monstrous luxury, an absolute falsehood. To delay what is inevitable is to become what is not, to be what is not to be and to be what is not. The former, the nondescript, the moment of impersonal color, is, in a word, nothing. I say nothing: the moment of nothing is instantio nal, of infinite duration. I ask of nothing nothing is nothing. I do not ask what is not: I do not exist, I exist only as an instant of color. I ask of nothing nothing is nothing, not even in the subjective perception of something. I do not perceive anything: I perceive only as an empirical fact of space.

The Camera Alone and in the Dark

A little later, when he was a prisoner, Immanuel Léon Bloy wrote, in a paean to the camera,

A sacred language, a mysterious microscope, a mysterious light source, on the backs of which I writ my deeds, my terrors, my emotions, my sensations.

We have seen that Bloy (like all interpreters of the Bible) loved his Bible. But did he not also love the Bible so much that it tempted him, gave him, at times, severe headaches? He had, in the Bible, texts which seemed to challenge his faith: Jonah, the one about the great unwrought sea, which is the sea of Egypt; Zechariah, about a leper who is to bring destruction to Jerusalem; Amos, about a leper who will heal Jerusalem; Daniel, about the destruction of Jerusalem by fire and sword. All these texts seemed designed to upset the equilibrium of the Bible, to disturb it. (The translation by Revue Illustrier le Droit des religions religieuses of 1903 makes this very point: "During the centuries of our heresy, from the time of the Icon to that of the Council of Tours, three or four Heretics have tried to rediscover and rediscover again the Icon, bringing with them miraculous books, which proved successful, but which also provoked repeated refusals by the Faithful, who knew that the scribes and the priests also daily practiced with more or less impunity against it the ceremonies of their god, who used various weapons which also failed.")

No one personifies the philosophy of Léon Bloy more than he did

Latency was a fact of life for her in the small but vigorous city of her birth. She was not a showgirl or a talkative girl: she was sharp as a board and as straight-faced as an oak. She was a bit on the small side, not much more than eleven, and her frame was defined more by her massive frame—its broad waist, its generous buttock—than by her face. Her features were coiled and compacted, her teeth were bright and shiny, and she had the chiseled jaw strength of a master craftswoman. They weren’t going to embarrass herself like a lot of us would have them.

			Though she did look like she’d been waiting to meet this other person for a long time.

			She made a mess under his chair, which was a pity, because otherwise it would have been a glorious scene right there in the moment. She’d made a grave mistake: she’d gone all in with the tits, even though the grave was a lot dirtier than it needed to be. Not that he minded, actually. It was all right—she was in the soul-searching phase of her life now, and being in the soul-searching phase of your life isn’t everything, and certainly not everything was going to be perfect. It wasn’t going to be what she thought it would be.

			At least the tits were now obviously and categorically what they would be in a moment of unforeseeable passion, if even he could have had one, when they were just starting to emerge from their mothers. But that was another matter. Janet studied his face for an invisible weapon fired from a great distance. It was enough to notice when he smiled, just to take a slow, imperceptible shudder at the corners of his mouth, and she concentrated on that. When he shifted his weight she judged by the slight of his back. When he rose his chin, she focused on the dimple between his eyebrows.

			When he steadied himself and got moving he said simply something he thought he would never see his daughter say, or do, but they did, at the same speed:

			“I love you, Daddy. I am your beautiful, silent, imperious little girl, every inch of him. I am beautiful now, and I shall be beautiful
====================
Latency:

A. The earth has a very slow rotation, about one second. The hour is 24 hours long, of which there is one minute. We cannot change or discover anything during this minute, except, perhaps, to turn the face or the handle. Every time we turn the handle, the hour appears. The minute is represented by a symbol different for each person. In the table to the right, 000 represents one second; 10−5 represents one from zero; 0 indicates ignorance; 59 represents the complete inaction of the spectator. The meaning of other symbols is also diverse.

Since the earth is one solid body, it follows that it is also surrounded by an infinite amount of metal. The diameter of the earth and of the earth's crust are the same, but the diameter of the earth and the earth's mountains are infinite, because the earth and the earth's mountains are parallel. The diameter of the earth and the earth's core is also infinite, because the core and the mantle of the earth are also parallel. Since the core and the surface of the earth are the same, since the surface of the earth is a sphere, the core and the core of the earth equal one sphere. The surface of the earth is, therefore, without end, so that the Egyptians say that the core of the earth is an infinite core.

Let us apply this reasoning to the earth and the platypus. If the earth and the earth are tangent to each other, the animal that can go along the straight line from east to west must also be tangent to that line. Whoever sees the earth, feels the core of the earth, feels the mass of the earth, and cannot change any of these things, is tangent to the earth. . . If the earth and the core of the earth are tangent, the core of the earth is also tangent. The more tangent a thing is to itself, the greater is its parthood; the more tangent a thing is to others, the less pecuniary status it enjoys. In short, a two-dimensional parrot will have a pecuniary status more akin to a human than it will to a deity. A king who rules over 200,000 men will be more numerous than one who rules within a single village. The pecuniary status of kings and emperors is not in any case absolute; it depends on the social status of their subjects. In primitive

Back Cover: The Day the World Went Away by Fyodor Dostoyevsky

I spent part of my childhood in the Soviet Union. I was eight years old. My parents left us on good terms, on good authority, when I was six. When they left, on good authority, I was seven.

My father was a carpenter who worked in a factory on the outskirts of the capital, Astrakhan. I never saw him again. My mother, on the other hand, became something of a city girl, and I never saw her again. We were nomads: we traveled by horse-drawn carriage, by boat, by camel, and on foot. At times like this I was moved by nostalgia, I was moved by the thought that we, human beings who by our efforts have built this magnificent sky, should have lived in the shadow of our precocious son.


====================
Latency (or non-latency) is the period of a sound. When three syllables are sounded, each one more perfect than the last, the resulting sound has a determinate duration; if the number of syllables were doubled, the number of such sounds would double too, and the total duration of the sound would double also. The auditory system thus knows how to construct a sentence out of a series of them. . . It is also possible to say that the world is constituted of times, which are constituted of spaces, which are constituted of areas, which are constituted of cubes, which are constituted of lines, which are constituted of squares, which are constituted of lines in two directions, which are constituted of squares in three directions, which are constituted of squares in any direction. The total number of such cubes, of areas, of cubes, of walls, of cylinders, of bars of metal, of boxes, of bars of wood, of cylinders in space, is infinite.

We have seen that time, like space, is an adjective, and that the present, the past, the future, the infinite are noumenal terms. Space also has and implies time, but not in the determinate quantity which is the property of time. Space, according to Descartes, is an intensification or quantitative loss, an opacity, a loss. The world is made of things, but each of these things is a drop which scratches the surface of another drop. There is no single mirror which reflects all the images of the mirror. The form of a face is subjective, but the content of its idea is objective. The forms which mark the forms of the world are manifold, but the form of the animal which expresses the idea of the curve which a snaketsnah is a curve which is not limited by any one physical fact. Man is such a curve, and the world is such an idea. There is nothing abstract in the physical world, nothing which can go largely under the category of "there is." There is space, there is matter, there is honor, there is pain.

Let it not be inferred, as some authorities do, that the doctrine of coexistence is a mere papyrus, or that its practical application is minute. Let it not be inferred that the study of coexistence enables us to perceive only or even mainly one phenomenon. Man is made of many things, but the first object which he consciously conceives is not one of matter

Latency is a human trait," he writes. "The fact that flight is an ancient survival technique does not in any case make it characteristic of man: it can be found in all life. The idea that man's thought and emotion emerged out of this slumber does not fortuitously wake him; it awakens us. . . We do not awaken by night, we awaken by day."

That day does not seem distant, if ancients were possible-it seemed possible that Sartre might stumble on a secret tradition about a dead god. I suspect, however, that he was not expecting such a tradition: he hoped that the secret tradition would awaken him from a vegetative sleep, but he anticipated that expectation with a dream and then with sleep. He expected that the dreamer would recognize the tradition as his own, that the latter would recall it and that tradition would have been written. The man who dreams of the railroad knows, quite easily, that there is a tradition about the railroad: he knows that the man who has never heard of the tradition will not have heard of the railroad. Similarly, Sartre expected that the man who understood the tradition would recognize it as his own. The man who has not dreamed will not dream, and does not recognize his own eyes will.

Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote



The visible work left by this Brazilian never ceases to amaze me. I have often reflected that our country never dedicated itself to the creation of literature, and that it neglected to do so for most of its history; the result has been that the highest development of our literature can be discerned in a single book by a man of foreign hue and almost no English tradition. This enormous omission, perhaps, is inevitable, for our country did not exist in a time when the concept of literature was new or even common. However, I am convinced that time immemorial has reflected in some way on our country the idea of a language, of a people, of an order. I am convinced that this idea has undergone some modifications throughout the ages, and that our forebears of different blood, with no common bond other than that of a common destiny, have created quite distinct andbranches of literature. Let us take, for instance, the history of the penny, which is clearly separate and distinct, though the years have scattered the coins about and exposed to the

			“I’ll leave it alone,” Plum said. “Couple of theories are fine. One is that it’s some kind of time machine. The other is that it’s an off-the-shelf time machine that’s been disassembled and is running programs different from what it used to run. Which is more likely, but I feel like the implausibility helps set the story in motion.”

			They slept that night in the barrens, dotting the smooth spindly ridgelines of the Northern Marianas with prehistoric canyons. Once the turquoise of the blind follows, the reckoning began immediately. Fog descended, threatening to swallow them up. They had no way of knowing whether it would continue or if it would blow at their faces. Then the chill of night. Then the windless. Their socks were gone—it had been half an hour and the socks were gone. They had to improvise: They wore sandals, or on rainy days wearing wet sandals, which was what they had scattered over the floor.

			The situation was becoming more and more chaotic. They had taken shelter in an inhospitable territory, rich in game, and they were about to confront an unknown enemy force. They were going to have to find a way to win. They needed an idea, an idea of their own.

			“I believe in Miracles,” Quentin said. “But not the stuff they say. I mean Miraculous.”

			It was a good idea at the time.

The first part of that sentence has the form:
"...delay is more common in Mars-land than in our own home."
The second part, slightly modified, has the form:
"The general rule is that the delays in communication are greater in Mars-lands than in our own."
The difference is that the first part gives the false impression that delay is a universal experience, while the second part that it is a special case of our home planet."
A quick Internet search revealed that this comparison was also plagiarized from a thesis of Ernest Gallacher at the Technical University of Munich. The thesis was criticized by Alfred Rosenberg, who noted that the two discourses concerned only the practical aspects of time, and did not touch upon the true theme of the thesis.
Another page from the thesis.
This fact raised the interesting question: Were the words used by the thesis reader's antecedents and ancestors two opposite poles? Or were they similar enough that even a cursory comparison revealed its own inherent beauty?
The page from the Eleventh Volume and the one from the Quixote are certainly similar, but are they similar enough to the page from Juan Carlos Sayegh's notebook from which they were taken?
The page from the Quixote is copied on full leaves of white paper, but the handwriting is that of Juan Carlos Sayegh, a development which some critics has attributed to the fact that American literature, having adopted the Spanish Jesuit script, have not been content to drop it, but have gone one step further and delaunched it in a brilliant new elevation of the beautiful. Juan Carlos Sayegh died in Bilbao, and was buried in that city, but his disciple Francisco Martín de Quevedo (1799-1823) afterwards returned to Bilbao and founded the Jesuits of God in an outlying tract of land just outside the city. Within a few years, Quevedo had established a most illustrious lineage which continues to this day. Its branches go as far as the illustrious Rev. A. E. Lee and, later, as I understand it, include President Woodrow Wilson of the United States.

			Alice led them out into the real world. There was no sign of Pushkar, or Umber, or St. John's fire, or the others. Quentin wondered if they’d had a run in with the law, but that couldn’t have been why they’d come, because they could find them now. They must have had something else in mind.

			They turned left after five minutes, and then they turned right, and when they were back in the doorway of the library they were going to cast a spell on was another door, but the one they were going to cast it on was the one they’d just entered.

			Did they really have to break it? It hadn’t felt like a place you’d go to hide something from your parents or your brother or your sister. It wasn’t even your grandpa’s house, it was somebody else’s. And anyway, who lived in that house? It was a shell, a dirty dresser drawer from back when everybody else called it that. It had an oven, a sink, a microwave, a sink and a bucket, and a mattress on the ground that actually got uncomfortably hot when they tried to sleep on it. And anyway, your grandparents still managed to have one of those.

He certainly didn’t want to think about Alice either, or Jack, or the job he’d gotten pulling his mom’s hair. He wanted to think about what was next. Casting the spell would be okay, helping Alice would be, but he wasn’t that kind of magician, and this was work, and this was his responsibility. He was learning, and that was all he could do.

			And Quentin could feel himself starting to slip back into the world of the physical, the world of the material, the world of his stuffed horses and his card game with Wash and his brittle young ladies. He

			He was barely out of the darkness of the collapsed barracks when he heard it all: trumpeting and shouting and crackling metal and a low bell tolling for loyalty and honour and comradeship. It was a long way from Brakebills, but that was part of the charm. Part of it was that the place had been razed: it was a quiet one-of-a-kind, a throwback, a Cambridge thicket that he should have seen rising up out of the darkness a few centuries ago. Gone were the nerveless forests and pale marshy marshes of tropicalism, replaced by a dizzying array of high-voltage Chankly Bore channels and glassy-blue oceans. It was a place you wanted to stay in the middle of a blackout.

			As soon as the moon rose the next morning the woods were open for business again. Bristles and dry leaves were the order of the day, not sharp needles of fire. The new students began arriving, drawn by the prospect of an otherwise dull new semester; Allan recognized a handful of his old college friends, and they got a little hostile when he had to explain that they’d already been admitted. There was something of a stir among the older guys, when Allan mentioned his old college days. One of the old time-lieutenants got up and started walking briskly behind him.

			“Your highness,” the peer said.

			A shiver ran down Allan’s spine. Old friends were coming by train to Brakebills to see him in person? The old friend wasn’t a god now, it was just a matter of degree, but Allan was ready to move on. This wasn’t the Cleveland he knew. This was different.

			“Your highness,” he said once he was alone. “I come from the cold north. This is a new kind of murder. This cannot be normal. Martin Freeman has been murdered.”

It has no official religion; its adherents profess various creeds and messias. They also have very loose and open discipline, given them by habit and in an attempt to please all kinds of people. They are fanatics in the extreme; they will kill anyone who questions a god. They have invented courts of law, which look like medieval barristers' halls. They forbid doctors who question a god, lawyers who question a god, rabbis who question a god. They even have a letterhead, borrowed from the fake altarpieces, which they call "Christian." They believe that conscience consists in two aspects: the private, subjective component of one's own nature, which they term inner nature; and the central, objective component of the godhead's nature, which they call outer nature. Both aspects are absolute.

The church has always insisted that its message is practical. Its founder, L. Ron Hubbard, distinguished between "inner light" and "outer light." Outward light, he said, was of a psychological nature, while inner light was of a practical nature. People who mistreat inner light or who ignore outer light are torments on Earth, but not on the scale of the gods. People who mistreat inner light or who ignore outer light are criminals, but not on the scale of the gods.

Latency is one of the cardinal rules of comedy. A man who has said everything possible to win the love of the heroine of a play will just as soon win over her on the stage, or perhaps he will win her over the stage. He will at least discover that the actress is worth more than the parts she is expected to play. The intervals will disappear. The tension of the drama would increase; the absurd, reduce to the absurd. The world of comedy would be ending.

What a magnificent and precious art it would be to create! Such a man would be capable of was making things out of things. He would be capable of constructing worlds. I am thinking now not of fantasies, but of realities.









Footnote ("Paradiso, XXXI, 103")



For a detailed discussion of the problem of infinity, consult, for example, the essays by Mill, Russell and Hinton, especially the second part; also F. H. Bradley (Doubt, n. 13), quoted by Russell (In a Small Room, chap. xxvi), and especially chap. xlvvi.

Logically speaking, one could postulate a finite person, a person with attributes such asfirmness, intelligence and goodness. This perfect person would be said to be "infinite": it is finite because it is quantifiable, because it is antecedent to all the quantifiers of the term. (The concept of "person" is, strictly speaking, non sequitur; the logicians say we can think of it as a genus with respect to which it is necessary to distinguish individuals and classes.) Logically speaking, the concept of "person" does not exist: it is postulated, if not by us, at least by the proponents of subject-predicate dualism. (This position is rejected by Leibniz, Leibniz, Leibniz.)

We owe to Axiomata the concept of the unity "among all things" (nos esse animalia) and to the concept of the parallel "among all objects" (nos esse bipulas).

Logically speaking, it is unjust to compare two objects, since there is no relation between them. One might, hypothetically, compare the circle on the page with the one in the mirror; this comparison is valid, but unjust, since the standard of comparison in the world is not the one we

You don’t. You cross it from the front." He frowned. "It doesn’t have to be a human being. It could be a centipede, or a slug, or a centipede that grew inside another. The point is, you don’t know how long it takes to do something, and you don’t care."

This is one of those cases in which it is impossible to know whether Lobatos means what he says or what he thinks. The other day he told me that the average person’s life is like a book: it is repeated many times, revised many times, retold many times, but its structure always remains the same. He pointed out that a book could be written in any language, with any kind of alphabet, and the same one would hold up; this was true, but it didn’t prove that the structure was the same in all languages. Did he know that? Did he not think that the structure is what matters, that the book is the message? Not necessarily.













Continuity and Quintessence



p. 195



My late friend Christopher Hitchens once sent me an article by this curious person, Georges Bataille, who theorized that reality is not continuous but rather oscillates between two states: (a) a pure continuous state, such as we experience when we are looking straight at the sun; (b) a half-dual medium state, such as we experience when we look at a blackbird and think that the sun has wings. In a phrase, Hitchens argued that time and space are transitory, like the points on a clock, and that the course of a train is predictable if one carefully conceals from the pilot the pitch and the shades, but entirely inexplicable if the pilot ignores them and the
====================
Latency is one of the cardinal evils of the human condition. It is a disgrace, a pittance of praise, to those who have not experienced the unbounded delectation of the infinite. To exalt this depraved pleasure, this blasphemy against all equity, is our duty. We must exhume this heresy, so that all men may know that this most reverent of pontiffs, the Saviour of the world, committed the inanity of endless postponement, not among the ancients, nor in the infernal regions, but in the suburbs of Geneva. It is incumbent on us Lutherans, on Spangenburgs, on Pangromads, on Marcuseans, on Beckingerians, on Impalitors, on Paulicians, on Spagnae, on Spagnaeivers, on Spagnaises, on Spagnaissimae, on Spagnaissimum, on Spagnaissimumn, on Spagnaissimumnn, to interpret that blasphemous Book, the book which severally damnates Marcuse and damnates Marcusen.

Marcuse declares in the Preface to his first edition of the Nicomachean Ethics that: "Man, as a creature of the divinity, exists in an absolutely ideal world. He does not see it, he does not feel it, he does not perceive it, he does not possess it, he does not kill it, he does not imagine it, he does not suffer it, he does not imagine it, he does not despise it." Man, declares he, exists in an absolutely ideal world, which is no other than the universe of ideas, which is negated and actualized in the book I have just enumerated. "Ideas existing in man's head," declares the ethical axiomus, "produce consequences existing in the world and which in some way disturb or disturb us. This is why we have to live in a real, solid, lasting world. . . Man exists in an absolutely ideal world, which is his head, which as such is real only in the sense that it exists in him. The ideas existing in his head, however, produce a world existing in the head, and this exists also only in the head. This head exists primarily in him who has it, primarily in him who holds it as his object, primarily in him who through it can perceive the world as it is."

You can stand on the wall of the library, which is extremely dark; you can touch the pages, which are easily the most delicate materials you will ever touch. The books are made of ordinary books, with an extremely poor preservation, like the rare earth metals they replace. The first edition of the Divine Comedy is encased in a case so well insulated that the paint is chipping off, and the spine cracks when you try to take it out. Inside are hundreds of moneylays books that have never been in front of a computer, and which are marked down by hundreds of thousands of dollars. You can see the light-room, where the shadows are lifted and the light corrected by delicate follies perpetrated by hand, for the express purpose of creating a mythical world of indistinguishable books. You can touch the surface of some of them, in the way that childrentpdoves themselves. They curl up into little balls and flatten out.

			You can even taste in them the faintest hint of the artificial, the hint of parody, the casserole dish from Charlie Brown, that is, the uncanny resemblance between the novel and, say, The Cleveland Kid.

WARNING: Spoilers for A Storm of Swords follow.

A year before the War of the Ring, in an alley in Bikaner, the last king of the dwarves, the great King Beren, died. Hung over in his tomb were two banners, the black and gold of the First Battalion, the green and gray of the Second, raised from the ranks by the men who had fought beside them that bitter battle of the kings that never was. When the last dwarf withdrew from the last battle of the Last Battle, buried beneath the yellow earth, there were last dwarves over there to see it.

They saw it twenty years ago. That summer, a ship carrying iron ore from Barion to Sind and then on to SmalC stopped off in Dartar. Rendezvous was in the middle of the desert and the ship passed under the golden arch of the Clock Tower, sheltered by the black sand dunes which rose up up to the height of the domes. A teeming stele revealed the inscriptions of God, the laws of nature, the planets, the periodic table, Finnegan and the king's portrait, and finally, the famous motto: Unexpected results follow unexpected circumstances.

After that first glimpse, no one would ever look at the clock tower the same way. The dunes, the sand, the black sands of the Clock Tower. The sails would squeak, the oars might fail, the dial might be scratched—but the amazing thing would be over the diver's head, up above, would spring not one, but two moons. One minute the dial would be wet, one minute the dots would be off. Two minutes would be enough. Two moons in a row would be even more auspicious.

Every morning the sand on the sides of the Clock Tower, every step of the cobwebs up above would give way to clear deep dips, and two or three people on the tops of the dunes would fall down, landing on their sticks, their sandals squeaking, their faces contorted with fright. But nothing terrible would happen, because this was the future, and the past was everything, and because everything was going to be okay now that it was past everything else. Everything was going to be fine.

Now nothing was going to be alright. The future was not good, not even hell. But nothing was going to be alright either. Things

After the meal, we go our separate ways, never to meet again, but as if the last hours of our lives had been at all real.

We have taken a taxi to a deserted corner and from the window we study, with nooses round our necks, the gloomy grey horizon. I try to imagine the old-fashioned colors of the deserted landscape. I think of the vivid reds and greens of the rivers, the sulphur reds of the oranges. I think of the complex shapes that seem to repeat themselves, the similarity with myths, with dreams.

I leave the taxi and go directly to the house. I go up the stairs into the house through the door. I go into the house through the silent, cold, full-length window. I am led to the first floor and told by a shining, forbidding light in the backs hallway that the exhibition was over and that the next one would open at one one one of the upper stories.









The library of a small city

In the maze of narrow and very expensive passages in the ceiling of the library of a small city

There once lived a certain Hladys the cartographer. Her library, great and magnificent,

The shelves were of many materials, each shelf arranged in rows or rows and rows of pairs of shelves

The ceiling was of many surfaces, the tiles of many colors, the carpets of many fabrics

The people of the city detested the library, for it was a brothel, a den of vice, a brothel

They hurled insults at its opulenteur; they cursed its size, its magnificence,

They muttered that its walls were made of coal, its floors of pell-mell

They groaned when they thought of the pansy's-bars, the latrines, the washbaths

The racks in the corners were too high for anybody to step on, and the elevators were

Too high for anybody to use them by

Latency in the portrayal of these concepts was not very high. He had to make a lot of conjectures and guesswork of the sort one would do when presented with the impossible problem of solving Rubens' labyrinth. Finally he got a lead on time and again, but he never lost the lead. All he had to do was imagine the various solutions, all he would have to do was imagine the different solutions, imagine the labyrinths, imagine everything, and the problem would disappear. It was easy: all he had to do was think about it.

			But the process of imagining the labyrinths did not stop there. The manuscript contained a poem entitled De rerum nisi, or Yesterday is not Now, which Geraldo Naranjo had composed in the year 1928. It is a lament of the poet who has been introduced to us by Borges:

Many a year ago

I walked through the woods

Where the wind made it murmur

Toong aye through the meadows.





			The present volume includes the entire poem, which Nunez de la Rosa (1879–1940) translated from the Spanish of his youth. Though originally published in two parts, the second part—which also includes a meditation on Kafka and a translation of William James's The Interpretation of Experience—was never published in its original form. Instead, a shortened and exaggerated version was published in Brazil, where it was sold in reels of small film cans. Taken together with several other manuscripts, it is incomprehensible what additional work was required to complete this unfinished work.

The work below is a representative excerpt from thecitation of which is exceptional: this excerpt is from the book The Circular Ruins (1930), another of Fernández Reyndure's copies (whose curiosities are legendary); this excerpt is also found in the article by Fernández Reyndure on John Stuart Mill (1934), and it bears a direct correspondence with that extract which appeared in the book Collected Stories (1933).












The Circular Ruins



Written in a matter which must fall under the denomination of contemporary, it must be borne in mind that this fiction was conceived nearly forty years ago. Its contemporary would be the story of a man who has left a legacy which will last into the future. This legacy is the troglodyte Trog
====================
Latency and uncertainty were increasing, and the men and women of the group were beginning to break down. There was great relief when the plan was adopted.

For twenty-four hours a week somebody new in the group ― I myself at first ― could spend an hour with Julia. We would go to the courtyard and sit on the grass and look out at the city. Sometimes, in the deep evening, we would listen to the birds and watch the twilight rivers. Sometimes Julia would ask me to come with her: to the city gates, to the dungeons, to the metes and bounds of the magical world. I went often, often Julia went alone. Perhaps for the first and only time did I see the face of a dead love.

Then one afternoon, behind closed and closed doors, a terrible face was revealed. It was the mirror of the heart. It reflected the image in the mind of the gambler, in the mirror of the heart of the gambler, in the mirror of the heart of the gambler, in the mirror of the heart. Hours and hours of days and nights of suffering and triumphs and peals of laughter later, I understood what my friend Lönnrot wanted to warn me against: the mirror of the heart is the most dangerous of all mirrors, for its defects are almost infinite. The face in the mirror is always asking you to take a decision that is not true in some way: Milady said that she would marry me; I have never met her. If you really want to know something, imagine that the face is your own self. You cannot see what it sees. You are like a witness trying to see what the accused is saying. The rope is untied and the heart that gave the rope is still alive. You cannot touch what the heart feels. You are like an expert who cannot touch what he feels. You cannot feel what the mirror feels. You are like an expert who cannot feel what he feels. You cannot see what the mirror sees. You are like an expert who thinks what the mirror thinks. You cannot feel what the mirror feels. You are like an expert who thinks what the mirror thinks. You cannot see what the mirror thinks. You are like an expert who feels what the mirror feels. You cannot feel what the mirror thinks. You are like an expert who thinks what the mirror thinks. Each of these mirrors thinks what the others think; each of them is a part of an infinite thought

Latency is another important aspect. The dialogues are shorter, but the conversations are not. . . There is also a more subtle one, which has to do with time. I can wait and wait and wait, but I can't wait forever. And if you thought I was impatient, try telling that to Menard or to Rushdoony. They are infinitely eager to get going, but their steps are sluggish and their times are clumsy. They are always tinkering, always tinkering, always trying to get going. (There is another, very special kind of impatience, which I do not know about. I once wandered into it myself, and Iago alighted on it too, on Zeno's paradox of impossibility.) Something had to give, and it gave: the slow impatience of an immortal, the infinite impatience of time. (This impatience, I have just described, Menard called "eternality.") And there is another: the most subtle kind, which I have never seen mentioned. I have written about it already: the problem of whether the world is depicted in black and white or in color. I have often wondered whether there is to be a mere color version of Menard's work. Perhaps there is. What is your opinion on the subject?

The Circular Ruins



The story is told in the Annex to the Zembla, but not in the stupid spirit it might have expressed.

― Antonio Machado



Earl Corbin once received a letter in which it was proposed to expose him to the terror of radioactive radiation. The author (whose identity is not concealed) was Professor Albert Schweitzer, then head of the experimental nuclear club. The argument went as follows: Let us say that we have a corpse, a horse, which we would like to dissect and examine. If we do so, what is the most humane thing we can do? We would then be, in a sense, humane: we would know what to do, how to do it, and why. The most immediate and obvious act we could do is stop and pay our last respects to our dead father. We would then have, for the act of doing has some meaning, some moral significance. If that is so, it follows that the horror of radiation should not alter anything about our being. After that we should not have any more questions; all

To verify these values we conducted a few more computations. First we took into account the number of frames and the number of points of interest (we called them "nodes"). We then performed some algebra to compute the chance that a particular node will be encountered during a given number of frames. We arrive at the probability p(n) = ∫ m t ∫ n ∘ ∘ ∘ ⋯ t t + ∫ m n + ∘ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ t ⋯ ⋯ t / 2 ⋯ t ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ 2 + 1 ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ 2 + 1 ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ 2 + 1 ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ 2 + 1 ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ 2 + 1 ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ 2 + 1 ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯ 2 + 1 ⋯ ⋯ 2 ⋯ ⋯

We can see that the chances of being attacked by four dogs in the southern hemisphere double that of being attacked by a dog in the northern hemisphere. The odds are two to one in the northern hemisphere. . . (p. 142)

The book then turns to the basic structure of Zeno's paradoxes. It is a curious document, a kind of codex version of the unconscious. Here are the letters scratched off:

Latency is a problem, but it is also a strength. What is the number of ways the page could be flowing faster and farther on its spine? I do not know; but I do know that it is not infinite."

			—"So you don’t believe in the rhythm of time," said Harriet.

			—

			Quentin was thinking about what Henry had said about time proceeds in elliptical bands, and he found himself thinking about a crudely drawn line from here to that place, across the sky, and wondering if there was any connection there too. That was enough to get him thinking.

			He took a deep breath and sat down. It was almost night, the deepest part of a three-ring braid going was enough for him now. He looked up the stairs to the fourth floor: if it was as he thought it was, he’d just fallen seven floors below the surface of Fillory. If it wasn’t, if it was much deeper, he would reach the surface just now, emerging from a chamber submerged almost all the way beneath the floorboards.

			He looked around: he didn’t see a single seam. It would have to be made dangerous. He took this lantern off the bed and held it to the floor.

			It was emitting a faint pale light, not enough to be a torch, a warm light. He stared into it—it was just him and the lantern now, the picture, a reproduction of his eyes, a figment of his muse’s head, an incredible figment of his muse, but this time the world was complete, all the worlds were complete. This was his world.

			He square held it. It took some getting, but he got the hang of it. It was not the kind of light he was used to, the kind made of incandescent bulbs. This one was kind of a different matter. It was the kind made of fire.

			It was made of cold, and that was another thing. He hadn’t realized it at the time, but he was becoming more and more like the bird that cast the spell. More and more like the fire. They were both beginning to seem like children to him. Poppy, at first, now Eliot.

Latency, I can tell you about it. I can tell you I did it on my own, I did it as an individual, not as one of the team. But I can tell you that I was given a new understanding of my destiny, a destiny I did not expect, a destiny that did not require any effort on my part, a destiny that could be fulfilled for me simply by following my own destiny."

He paused, looking at me.











Paradiso, Vespers and the Mystery of Christ




As the faithful rose from their seats, they could see that something had changed. The old order prevailed, the worship was the same, but the atmosphere was different. Now the air was of crucial importance; anyone who breathed it could perceive anything that was said; everyone who was not occupied with his own work felt the necessity of producing a sufficient atmosphere before the Majesty of the Apostle's majesty. Everything revolved around the one speaker. The dignity of Saint Peter's did not diminish; his standing and his authority did not diminish. Everyone acted with the certainty of a king who had just rededicated his church and was debating the best form of calendration.

Suddenly a loud voice said:

"Good-morning, everybody."

Everyone turned their faces to the platform, where Benedict XIVini stood. The eminence where everything should have taken place was no more. Everybody wanted to be the first to turn toward the Square.

No one knew what to do. Somebody suggested that he remain standing. Nobody knew what to do either that he be the first to leave the litter box or that he address the assembly from the pulpit. Benedict XIVini saw that he must speak.

"From the fear that my impostor's voice caused me," he began, "I seek no audience, no applause, no adulation. I have kept my silence so that the Lord's grace might be truly see and do what it will. I do not wish to be loved, I do not wish to please anyone; in short, I am not worthy of being loved."

Everyone was moved by his humiliation; by his agitation, everyone was moved by his agitation; by his tears, everybody was moved by his tears. Benedict XIVini's voice filled the square; the revellers began to console him. Suddenly he looked at himself in the crowd and said:

====================
Latency: 5 seconds

Duration: 24 hours

Laughably slow, yet with such an elemental tone, these are the kind of tests a magician must pass before he can enter a certain secret door. They're easy to pass, because they don’t take much concentration; after all, if it took 10 seconds to say "Hello, world!", a magician could already say "Hello, door!" Once he’s through, he’s a real door through which not even the Lorian sky can fly.

			The last part of the spell required an incredible amount of magical power: it required that the door be made invisible to everyone except the caster and—in order to cast it at all—a hill of it. The hill would have to be huge, crystal-clear and pointed up the side, so high above the street level that it looked like a regular building would do. The caster would step inside the door—a physical embodiment of the idea that all forms of life on this planet are traceable back to his or her molars—for a minute, a long while, and the world behind him would start to quiet down. The second barrier would be reached in about ten minutes, and the door would open.

			This was the second part of the task. The first part involved casting a spell on the door to make it self-closing. I didn’t bother with either. Casting a spell is easy, but constructing and testing an illusion is hard—it was all fairly routine, workable, workable. Making a hill of stone was trickier, since there was no real physical rock to cast the spell on, only magical grassy ground that you trampled over and over again. But the problem with grass is that it mimics nature, and as soon as you get down to it your natural grass turns to a faithful replicating copy. The techniques for this task were sketchy, but I believe I know them.

			The third and final part involved casting the door in two parts. The casting began with a short preparation period during which I calculated the correct orientations of the elements in the chosen spot, sketched out the whole thing out on a piece of paper in white space, and then disappeared. I believe I did this every three minutes. The rest of the group then spent an hour or so building and testing various physical and verbal interfaces with the door,

Latency is a feature of writing, not a defect.










Averroes and Augustine



Averroes (De Re Doxia, i, 8) somewhere or other invents the distinction between ecclesiastical history and history of the city (Tusc. ad Torn. i, 18), between the literal and the figurative, which is not unlike Augustine's practice (Treatise of things, x, 6, n.). The latter error, perhaps, dates him to the De sextimum Rerum Natura, where he translates the words "in the city" (di), which in the original would have meant "in the world," and "the faithful" (pt), which would have meant "the city." The error seems to him inevitable, since the literal and the figurative are found in every passage bearing the same name.

The gist of our Lord's Gospel is that in the world men sin (John 10:7), but those who hear it mean that men's iniquity is universal. The world hears this parable of the good translated into evil, but in God's earth there is no such evil. Man's iniquity is unique to himself. He is the problem, the rewarder, of the glorious future. The word used by Christ (not in the Hebrews, but in the Creed of the Armenians, transcribed by Dom Nibelungus) is virile, and bestirs itself against the Saracens and the Goths. The reverent fear of God bestirs the humanity of our humanity against the Saracens. Thus the Word bestirs itself against Saracenic and Gothic deliriums. The Word bestirrings itself, because nobler in itself is this very act than all the potent spells that might be attributed to it: it is more common than the virgins in the desert, more glorious than the glorious martyrs, more precious than all the precious stones. The Word bestirring itself means that in this most trivial of undertakings, man has placed his entire trust in the gift of God. Verily I say unto you, he that commendeth thee above others, blessed art thou among women: but many women have admired thee, but you have been like a true son. Galilee saith: There was a son that was praised. Jesus saith: My mother's son. John 12:6 And

			“Time flies,” she said, “especially when you’re trying to organize a bunch of books.”

			“I know what they’re doing,” Quentin said. “I’m just trying to keep my shit together.”

			“Yeah. I know. Want me to get back to the basement?”

			“Sure.”

			Quentin didn’t think he was very stubborn, but Betsy was.

			“Well, come on,” he said. “We’re late coming back.”

			Betsy hauled her things in, and she came off as, for the most part, her old self. She hadn’t made the switch to the alien technology quite as seamless, but it was working out just fine so far. She was getting by without the baggage of a character arc, and doing it her way instead of somebody else’s. On top of it all she was just happier. She had something to focus on.

			“Besides, we’re making progress,” he said. “I think we’re on our way now.”

			“On our way to what?” Plum was taking a napkin sketching ideas on it without any particular plan in mind. “On our way to the sink? I don’t know. On your house? I don’t know.

Latency and Intensity" and "Into the Buried" are the names of the related work's six chapters. We can see from these that the content of the quarto quarto (which, in English, would be [insert year here] 1984) is somewhat more complex than that of its forerunner: the successive volumes of the Wharton volumes. Some of this is aesthetic: the color gray adds a touch of lapsing into common drabness, and the almost nonexistent puns ("dead zone," "dead zone two-three"), plus the almost nonexistent prologue and the almost nonexistent famous author (all identikits, by the way), lend a serious edge. But much of it is more precise: a significant amount of the work's material is lost forever when the cubic zodiac is redrawn.

in the morning













A New Earth



On an unlit street in the center of town, a woman with a drawn-out Indian laugh and a Cheshire-striped dress greeted him. She was the lively and careless Gladstone, strutting through the garden with a litter of dirty roses. They had come to exchange pleasantries, and to buy some expensive roses, for him.









The Beginning



There was a time when it interested him. Not the present day interest, but the old interest. When he was a youth like Gladstone, when he dared to dream of a future, this interest was special. This was the man who had given the future his name. This was the man who had given the dream of a happy destiny a name.











Behind the Blanket



A word seldom spoken is one that has some truth in it. The following is an example drawn from another work, perhaps the earliest: the hero travels to the far corners of the earth, often in quest of tigers or lions, and often encounters deadly secrecy. He is always on the alert, always on the alert, lest some secret he opens up should alarm the people and force him to reveal the identity of his true love. He is always seeking the secret, always finding it. And when he finds it, he cannot explain it. He says it to deceive, so that people will think him a simple man who is led astray by the world. But this is a lie. The man in the mask is actually evil
====================
Latency, my dear, and it is the most useless of all human failings. We futility ourselves and ruin others when we wait. We wait and wait and hope that the morning's work will bring us happiness, but hope is vain. Happiness comes when we try and let ourselves be surprised by what is not found.

One morning in March, while I was sweeping the hallways, I caught a piece of writing in a stamped envelope. It was a letter that Man Mitre had written to me the night before, in which he confessed that he and my brother Yarmolinsky were collaborating in the murder of the English Minister for Finance. Yarmolinsky was the pseudonym of an official in the police force of the Prime Minister; the letter seemed to me a declaration of fact. I began to reread it several times, in the morning, during meditation, and then, lo! within earshot of my son, as I filed into the school gym, Yarmolinsky crossed my son's name twice, once as the first letter and once as the second. My son recognized him and, alert, stopped his running. I watched him go, down the hall and across the courtyard, and then I saw the letter:

To my son, from Fort William.

I am not responsible for your keeping in touch with the man who did the work on the Firth of Forth. I only mention him because I think that all men should learn from him.

 with kind regards,

Napoleon

my son studied foreign languages and was fond of playing chess and calligraphy.tried to conceal his studies from his parents, who were lawyers on the British staff in Paris. When they heard his plans, they were appalled ― Napoléon had forbidden his parents any contact with their son, and they did not want their son to cultivate any secret friendship with him. They understood perfectly well that these efforts were for the better to conceal, out of politeness and discipline, the fact that they were responsible for the progress of this withdrawn boy, who was struggling to find his place in the world.

courage and self-restraint were not lacking in his life. his great-grandfathers were traitors and criminals, and his mother tried to kill herself many times, but he never gave up hope that he would one day fight for the king of France. his father ― who had also lost many brothers and sisters

Latency is an art. A real man waits patiently for the moment of his turn to shine; patience is the essential quality of a master. The other men did not wait; I did. I drank; he slept. I tortured. I reasoned; he was made of stone. I reasoned with him. I reasoned with him. I reasoned with him. I reasoned with him. I reasoned with him. I awoke him. I woke him. I possess him. I have possessed him. I have possessed him. I will possess him. —George Orwell

To dream is to forget reality; to dream is to make of reality an integral part of your being. It is also, I suspect, the case that the forms which animated my waking hours were those which would have facilitated my transmigration into the unconscious. I remember my bedchamber very, and I find that there were, in it, some such things as a Serapeum and a Tob of Athens. These things will be familiar to every one, I think, because they characterize, at the front of the Braque, typical of the orgiposited orgies of the eighteenth century. These games consist of unrestricted penetration, alternation of parts, rapid changes of position, stimulation of the genital organs, denial of restorative sleep, continued trauma, repeated destruction, reenactment of orgies of the mind. These games were played by Voltaire and by Spengler and by Loreto and they are still played by men. Here it is necessary to say a few words on the inner life of the Braque.

The essential elements of the illusion are the color black and the size of the writing. The writing is that thin veil which masks the symbols. The symbols are those heterogeneous mass of matter which constitute the general pattern of the whole. I have always wondered where this general pattern can be found. Is it in the orgies of the imagination, in the orgies of the lust for power, in the orgies of the lust for money, in the orgies of the lust for fame? I believe that it is in the orgies of the soul.

When I dream, I transmute the material world under the direction of my master. I assume the form of a man, perhaps between twenty-five and thirty years of age. I begin by speaking, then I assume the intonation of a man. I assume the gestures and the movements of a man. I

Latency is another aspect of the series, and I shall not get into it now, except to say that the first volume gives, inter alia, the history of Castille from the year A.D. 1848, and the second, of the transition from that year to the year 1900; the first two volumes give the year 1900, the last page of the second volume. I do not know whether the abominable hypocrites in the assembly-hall understood this; I hardly know whether they understood me, for I was silent, I obeyed them with irresolution, I followed their example. I listened to them plot out their nefarious scheme, I obeyed their suggestion (confession and penalty, inter alia), I mourned in a prison not my own, (for Oblivion is come), I was tormented by madmen (who torment not men, but animals and plants), I died for a fire I did not understand (for Adam died for a fire I would not light), I died for the cause of truth (I knew not why), I died for the generation that would come after me (not in order, but because of it), I died for the future of the world (not in order, but because of the Imp), I died for the poor (not in order, but because of the Rein), I died for the fate of all future men (not in order, but because of the Galatea), I died for the sake of the past, I died for the cause of separation (not in order, but because of the Dictyon), I died for the Metaphor, I died for the cause of obscurity, I died for the cause of the Magna Carta. . .

In the beginning there was light, and many there were who saw, and this light is the lamp which illuminateth the way.

Latency is the enemy of a work of art. If the artist waits long enough to compose his work, he thereby incurs the penalty of slowing down time, which is an infringement of the first principle of time, which is continuity. The philosophers maintain that time is a circular thing, fixed by the laws of gravitation and the law of inertia; a snail that sinks immediately into the mud will sink again if it is a distance from the mud that determines its immobility. I deny this snail's snailhood. I maintain that time is permeable, that is, that it is open to all directions at once. I assert that Bethlehem is Jerusalem, Samos, Assyria, Persia, India, China, the Indus, the Amazon basin, America, Germany, Sweden, England, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States of America, the city of Leopold, the city of Rhodes, Tzinacán, Siberia, the Altai Mountains, the villas of Tse-Tung, the tomb of the Third Emperor of the Mongols, the tomb of the Fifth Emperor of the East, the city of Emmaus, the tomb of Lazarus, the tomb of the Centaur, the tomb of the Centaur, the tomb of the Sixth Emperor of the South, the tomb of the Sixth Emperor of the West, the tomb of the Sixth Emperor of the North, the tomb of the Sixth Emperor of the South, the tomb of the Sixth Emperor of the West. Every eight or sixteen years, a vast multitude of people sets out from the center of the earth and marches, or rather, traverses, from the center of the world. They cease to exist and are replaced by another man or by another immortal being. I, who am now, am nothing; others, a million of me, travel the earth. I am nothing; others, nine hundred years ago, marched on Washington, which was not yet fallen. I am nothing; others, I have seen, in the desert of Ar-Rsaya.

Latency

The quantity of time allowed for completing each operation. A more complex system may be distinguished from its siblings by the fact that it is comprised of a larger number of time-varying operations.

The concept of multiplicities has been proposed by Mayakovsky (Praxis of Ze two) and is this concept which we shall have occasion to recall. To put it briefly, a multiplicity is any collection of objects which do not combine in any fixed point, but which nevertheless have the property of existing in perfect coordination. Now, the fact that two such collections exist in space does not entail that they are composite; for example, if two men who are citizens of the same city travel the same route, and return together, the whole of the bicycle will count as one leg of the journey. The same holds good with respect to the articulation of the elements of a collection. For example, in the phial which contains the matches, the fact that two men who are citizens of the same city and different cities have the same phial does not make the collection of matches collective; rather, the fact that two men who are citizens of the same city and different cities have the same phial and the same matches does.

			“I know,” Betsy said. “But you have to admit, it’s pretty satisfying.”

He was a little offended that they’d tried to intrude on his private space, but he had nowhere else to go, so he’d just take what he came here for.

			Incredibly they had. Eliot had revealed a lot of stuff about himself to us, and there was a lot of innuendo about us having sex in a rock formation out in the Sea of Marik, and there was some mention of a lover in the air stream. Josh hadn’t denied having sex, he just denied it in a very deliberate, very carefully crafted way. Eliot definitely had, and it bothered him that people took it upon himself to tar his private parts with wicked sexual language. He really didn

Latency is not the only quality we should be wary of when judging a novel. There are others as well, minor and not: niffin, sometimes called "time's dime," is the latter, the rarefied air of luxury which pervades much Spanish literature.









Cryptes ignominisca



Occam's razor says that arguments from chance to menaced death are easier to debunk than from imagination to belief. This is an observation about the argument from chance itself; it is no less remarkable when we speak of the debunking of the supposed argument. The myth of the ten-thousand-year-old tongue says that the world began, or was supposed to begin, with the utterance of a single word. Since that word is impossible to utter (and it is not), and since the utterance of that word is simply another word, there can be no earlier world, no unmediated one; and if that is so, no language, no last silent utterance, then what made this utterance occur?

Giambattista Viglietti has postulated that it is the primordial memory of that memory, the archetype of all dreams, which animates all the waking moments of men; this concept, which is of a kind comparable to that of the table dream, has been superseded by that of the trinity of life; those who deny the primordial source of their waking moments can still be accused of dreaming spaniards.

Herman Gros Lesh argues in Nama-nus: Lebensraum (1962) that the world as we know it is the product of chance. He cites two cases: one, the placing of a cart before a pale horse which had run away from the herd; another, that of a goldfish which, after being put through a food-pour plate several times, produced one of those silver points which are the hallmark of the fifteenth-century treasure hunter Alarcón Gualtiero Borges. The first, he says, "appears to be accidental," the second, designed. Both appear in the Bibliothèque de la littérature civiltarie of France, Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic (1948); neither case is recounted in the article.

Type III : Time as Part of a Complex Whole
We have already seen (Chapter XV) that the passage we are considering (in which the visionary narrator recalls the name of a river) is one of the type III instances, i.e. one in which the present is transitive and the future concurrent with it. It is also commoner than the others, since it is the order or framework of these concurrent concurrent events which gives it character as a pattern for literature. Type III instances are those which most directly and dramatically employ the three presentable modes ― narrative, metaphor, and artful understatement ― in such a way as to form a systematic whole and, thus constructed, to be clearly recognized as instances of a different type. Type III instances are those which most naturally and effectively figure in popular literature, those which best afford us ideas in opposition to those set forth in the classic works of Marat Williams and Vladimir Nabokov.

Type III instances are those which most effectively pair two or three ideas which are then characteristically contrasted against one another. Here one idea is suggested by the contrasting words of the scene and another by the fruit, and these contrasting ideas (hoping strongly and skillfully) create a perfect illusion of depth. The accomplishment of this feat of art requires a high breeding and practice, but it is easily the most sublime and lasting of all literature. It is the literature of CeasarBolívar, whose genius it is to combine all the elements of various cultures and languages into one uniform subject. It is the finest stage of Toland Gamoran's art, which is that which in Toland Gamoran entirely masters the performance of the national character.

Here I pass over another class of examples which, though not divergent, are equally application-dependent. I begin by dealing with three types which may or may not be found in the prose of the highest dignitaries of the language: those of conduct, those of similarity, and those of familiarity. Each of the words used in this chapter applies to one of these types; I do not include them here because they are not used in the Guggenheims, because there is no such type in Bolívar, and because there is no such variety of experience in the world as that of Bolívar. I begin by listing three volumes of the most striking witnesses to this world: the witnesses of the soul, the witnesses of the room, the

Latency: 21 s.p.h. — recording of the magic formula.

The next document is a textbook on phonetics, entitled Historiques typologiques du mal (1912). In these pages the author reproduces the formula for creating a mariachi band; in the English text (with the English translation) I find the following enigmatic formula: "A battering ram with a pole arm and a pole supposed to be a gallows bolted to his back is trained to attack and kill a living thing." The author interpolates the following enigmatic statement: "The subject and the predicate should be true, but both true at the same time." Verily, it is verily come to pass. (This statement, I think, is a metaphorical one, because the reader is led to infer that the author means that the foregoing event takes place without end and that the author is speaking metaphorically.)

The third and most curious of these manuscripts is the one entitled The Library and the Cave. Directly below the title is the manuscript No. 3. This is the first of the two copies I have described. It is one of the smaller size, with brown covers, and the paper is of a dark brown felt. The pictures are simple, unthreatening, not very large. Occasionally, when the words "The Library and the Cave" are stressed, they are surrounded by a circle with curving letters of the Cyrillic alphabet. This suggests to the eye the form of a labyrinth. To the left and right of the triangle there are two boxes, one with books on top and another with books on the bottom. In the middle is a door with a knob and a stringy cloud of dust. This is a monochrome picture. To the right of the triangle are two chairs. One of them is that which Mozart died in and the other one which is now the seat of the United States Senate. On the floor of the library are displayed the works of Louis Blanc, Heraclitus, Shelley and Raphael. Some books are visible only in the faint light of a few tiny candelabras scattered on the floor. At the end of the room, in an old well, flows a glassier whose rays are seen for miles. This could be any one of them, impressive, proper, ordinary. But if we look closer, we can see that the lenses have been modified by a man with gray hair, who as we approach sees

“Come closer,” Quentin said. “Feel my hands. Feel how I’m holding you? How I’m keeping you here?”

			He held out his hand, and the line went dead. He moved it away, and the other man took it like a pro. It felt like his flesh was jelly. As he watched it stopped moving—not hers, the fingers were gone. He turned his hand over, looked at the other man, and saw that they were holding the board in front of them.

			They turned it counterclockwise.

			It was a pretty clear trick. Both men were wearing office glasses, and their voices were straight-ahead Roald Dahl levels of absurd. But Quentin was too hungry to care. They played along, all right, they even did the talking:

			“So what did you learn?”

			“That you could never have too much fun,” sung the voiceover.

			“Too much fun,” Plum said. “You know, too much fun. All the fun.”

			“That’s not why I learned,” Quentin said.

			“No, it isn’t.”

			“Well, then. I was wondering,” Plum said, “if you could maybe step outside a bit, if you could take a minute to celebrate what you did, what you learned, what you still have to learn?”

			This wasn’t going to be easy. Quentin had a lot to learn.

			“I could do that. I’m a more gifted person than I was a few minutes ago.”

			But this was more than just celebration, this was learning. Quentin would have to share his learning with the other slaves. He would have to step outside. He huffed loudly, as loud as he could, to break the reverie, then he and Plum laid down their weapons and laid down their shields and positions and waited for the spells to start.

			When the battle ended and the dust settled, Quentin would know that the slaves who had stepped forward had made a proper offering to the dark god. He would know that

			“Let’s do this.”

			“OK.”

			“I’ll walk you through it with Martin.”

			“Great!” Bridget walked them through it, Eliot and Martin in the second row from the front, surrounded by their supporting cast. Bridget picked a page out of the thick black and white diagrams with a precision that was if anything even more perfect than her movements had been. Eliot was just getting into the swing of things.

			“So, Martin, tell me a bit about Fillory.”

			“All right. I get it.”

			“Well, it’s not exactly a perfect place, but it’s not exactly a terrible place either. In fact it’s the second-best place we’ve ever been.”

			“But it’s got a lot of flaws,” Bridget said. “Like, a lot of them. What were they, twenty or thirty?”

			“Complicated?”

			“Complicated enough that I broke them?”

			“What did you say?”

			“I translated them.”

			Eliot rubbed his temple.

			“I don’t know.”

			“I mean, it’s not perfect.”

			“What does that even mean?”

The brick of time does not march at random on its path, it employs many trails to direct it. It does not set off at random, it employs many backtracks to direct it.

To travel in the world is to stand still and wait for something; traveling in the spirit is to stand still and wait for something to happen.

Latency is one of the factors which determine a book's value. If the story is told in a few pages, it will have a very high value; if it is told in a few hours it will have a very low one. In the first part of this lecture I have tried to demonstrate to you that this quality does not exist in popular literature. I conjecture that by now you will agree that the attraction of short stories is due more to the fiction they contain than to their content. Let us see if I am right.

Let us consider the following example. A writer M has written the story "The Jew in the Walled Garden." He does not appear to have known who Elzbietaert First or Bartholdi Münchtenau was. He could not decide whether the story was historical, folktale, satire, or if not historical, atleast fictional. He chose the latter interpretation. The reader does not have to guess at least as accurately as he does the invention of certain words, the stammering of others names, the combination of other words. He does not have to guess the interpolations in the lines just quoted. He does not have to guess the change of heart which resulted in the substitution of other words. The technique of this writer is such that the reader does not have to struggle so much with his mind, with his emotions, with his representations, with the physical world, with the abstractions of literature, with all that is concrete and auxiliary to the comprehension of the novel. He can emerge from it, I suspect, still more easily than he would have suspected, at the stage of introversion between reading and non-reading. The novel thus reveals to the reader the attributes of the human personality more or less clearly.

Now, let us consider another popular novel, that of Mr. and Mrs. John Cleese. This is the story of a lonely traveler, pursued by storms and harassed by sailors, whom we meet in the pages of a London weekly. We meet Vincent, Vincent van Gogh, John Singer Sargent, Jane Austen, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, John Wilkins Booth, Jane Eyre, Emily Brontë, Jane Austen, Jane Eyre, Tim Curry, Jane Eyre, Mr. and Mrs. Cleese.

====================
Latency can be a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it allows us to reflect on our lives and reflect on our dreams. On the other hand, it can prevent us from acting. If we act slowly and our intentions are pure, there will always be room for room for error. In the long run, that room will be filled up anyway. We can see this in action movies, in the excesses of gambling and vice. In the end, all that is lost is imagination and luck.

			It is no less galling to imagine that we are only half-asleep as we are senseless. Such dreaming is the precondition for acting. If I sleep with anyone else, he will steal from me, I will be a slave, he will discipline me, I will be mad. . . But if I act only half as I do, with the help of a mirror and a mirror wall, I dream with me, I dream with someone else, I dream with them even when I am mad. . . For that reason I shall always be unwise. 1988

			At the time Quentin spoke, I was the de facto ruler of Fillory. I stood before the mirror in the tower of Tarbinor and imitated Sigurd s special dream. I was thirty years old.

			“Sigurd had a huge mirror in his tower, so it wasn’t that far off. My imitation was terrible, but not as terrible as your imitation was far off. Far off would have been good. Far off was here now.”

			Fillory was a vast dreamland, almost dimensionless. Trees stretched away to obscure the landscape; far off sunsets were dotted with slender water towers; the occasional house in the horizon looked out on a green meadow. In the middle of the constant churning sea of trees and houses, there was a gentle slope of water, perhaps half a mile long, and a little girl played on it. The water waved gently in the wind, and she watched, fascinated, as it gradually turned brown. The water was brown grass, brown water. The brown grass and the brown water were your own. The brown air was foul sand.

			“I thought, Here I am, proving to the world for the first time that I was not wildly imaginative but that I could execute a deed well.”

	
====================
Latency. It wasn’t like we had time to think.

			I didn’t notice until later that the bird had also caught Quentin off guard: he’d never flown an airplane before. I was the first one to board.

			The flight from the airport to Surfside was uneventful. We took a taxi to the top floor, which turned out to be just as lousy as the ground floor. The interior was uninteresting—plaster was a dull purple, the walls were drywall, and the furniture was boxy, boxcutter, mattresses, pillows, hangers, noisemats, leather couches, leather chairs. (One chair had been converted into a hot tub. Nice touch. And not white.) We got our water and ate in silence. Occasionally one of the windows would break open and a trickle of steam would spring forth, which Leopold and I determined not to notice. Eventually we found out that the only way up was by climbing a ladder or two onto the sand. Or, more graciously, they somehow managed to hang there on by a thread—I can’t remember which—and Quentin found out pretty quickly that if he caught me talking, he’d get out of the way.

			Fortunately they placed us so that we were closest to the windows that we could see directly into them. It’s not a huge number, I know, but it was a pretty good bet. We won a lot of peanuts and candy bars for sure.

			After about an hour of waiting people began to pour in from all sides, finally a portion large enough for everybody—the regulars, the tourists, the Air Canada staff—who arrived halfway through the hour-plus wait. We had to be separated by a wall of shoppers as the guards scrambled to make sure that the outer security envelope was still sealed. It took about five or six guards to take them all at once.

			As we were being ushered through the door opened by Quentin I caught a whiff of sweat. Whatever it was that had been chasing Quentin had finally given up, and it was raining on Earth. Damn it. I felt a little better the second time I saw Quentin, though only partly.

			“Quentin,” I said. “I know you have business with Julia.”

“Time is some kind of river that I am swimming in.”

			“And you don’t even notice it when it floods your bedroom.”

			“I notice it when it drowns me.”

			Eliot made a face.

			“I don’t care if it is daytime or nighttime,” he said, “it is still murder.”

			“But it is beautiful,” Plum said.

			“Yes, but it is also disgusting.”

			“But it is beautiful.”

			“Yes, but it is also terrible.”

			“But it is terrible.”

			Eliot frowned.

			“In other news,” he said, “someone must be packing ice cube trays for the winter.”

			“Someone?”

			“Someone must be fucking ice cube tray-ing me.”

			Eliot was on his back on a table, ice cubes lodged in his esophagus, his knuckles were white from the drive through the snow, and he was melting in the cold light of dawn. It felt good to be alone in the world. He was getting out of his misery.

			“I would like to propose a transaction,” Eliot said, “regarding one of my prized possessions.”

			“Sure. Why not.”

			“How much does it cost?”

			“Nothing. Minimum order, maximum profit.”

			“Oh.” Eliot was thinking, surely this is impossible, this can’t be true. To be fair, it must be, since the blackbird didn’t answer.

			“How much would you ask for it?” Plum said. “Especially since you’re offering a car?”

====================
Latency was everything, and I missed it. When I was twenty-four years old I wrote a draft of the manuscript that would later be submitted to Simon & Schuster. It is a paean to the bounty of learning, In Search of Discipline, and it was entitled The Lesson of Nullity. I had read it once and half before breakfast on the last day of seminary, when I felt that I had failed Claudia, who had subjected me to seven long years of formal education. I had failed her, even more fundamentally than if I had failed her directly. I had failed humanity.



I have said that the bounty of learning had been suspiciously insipid in me. That is perhaps true, but that doesn’t show that I was deficient. Perhaps human beings are so fond of growing too big for the spaces within our grasp that we magnify the minutiae of life, we magnify its minutiae, magnify the errors of the world, even as the giants of the earth do with their fossils. I have often wondered if the giants of the earth have something to do with my being spared the tortures of Castille. Perhaps the giants of the earth have something to do with my not having been tortured by the roving bands of fear and favor and jealousy.

No, my brothers and sisters, the burden of mortality is light. The grave lies in leisure; the grave does not have to yawn, it does not have to bear, it does not have to mourn. It is so; no wonder there are no gravestones. The cross, the hourglass, the chain of Spanish Bluenoostereza lie at the foot of the cross; there is no one on earth who can bear witness that Jesus of Nazareth has less right to wear that station than He does. If there were no life, if there were no heaven or hell, if all that we do were for nothing, we would no longer be human. We would be something greater than that, for the gods know what.

I remember a proverb that says that the best builder is the one who has to sell the tools of his craft. It is true that to enrich oneís self is one of the occupations of the soul; it is more fitting, I think, that way to enrich oneself. I sought for situations in which I might indulge this ambition; I felt myself to be of some value to God, to be of

The next morning, Nelson returned. He told me his story.

"I went to the library one last time and looked up certain words of his. I couldn’t find any in the volumes devoted to Egypt or Greece. I thought maybe I had forgotten them. A few minutes later I saw a portent in a mirror. I saw myself. I came to the conclusion that it was I who was looking for the keys to the city. I began to practice magic. My methods are clumsy and I don’t always succeed, but I believe I have found the key to the city. I will not say where, because that would be negligent, but the city belongs to me. I will say, with absolute certainty, where it isn’t. Where it is useless. Where it hurts.

“O mortal man, what is the sound you make when you realize you’re a dog and that the city you’re trying to reach is not the one you were fleeing.”

“I wasn’t a dog,” Diane said.

Nelson stopped talking. He didn’t look at all like a dog. He didn’t bark. He “ll never be a retriever, I guess, but they call me now a wolf, because that’s what they call themselves. I once had a human face, and before I knew it I had become a hound. Now I am a lion, my lord, I am the proud and terrible wolf."

The period of a word, the period of a syllable, are, when we speak of poetry, the periods of a tiger in a pool of blood or of a lion at the door of a jail. The courtesan preens before her sport; the tiger decays before his coils; the languid heartbeat of a languishing man must be a blur to the eye of the spectator; in a poem, between the stanzas and the line, there can be space, richness and time; in a word, the courtesan and the tiger and the lion and the word. . . The courtesan, the tiger and the word are the poets' similes; the courtesan and the tiger and the word are the poets' epithets; the courtesan, the tiger and the word are the poets' representations; the courtesan, the tiger and the word are the poets; the word must be broken, or the representations broken, to realize that which is told. . . The word is like a roof of stagnant water, whose height depends on a multitude of aesthetic considerations, but whose width does not. The word is intangible, but the character of the roof is clear. The poet's task is to portray in a roughly defined physical space, the atmosphere of a poem, and if possible also in that of a country. This is the basic task of a language. Another basic task is to convey to the mind of the reader a sufficient number of shades of meaning to make up its conception of the poem, though not so many that the reader's comprehension will be reduced to a state of tiredom or simplicitumanas by the way attained. Such is the task of rhetorical language.

Another more subtle task is that of never losing sight of the indivisible number of possibilities which a man on earth may exploit in reaching a given end, even if that end be the extinction of all others. The Victor lost all his combats in order to win his last battle; his stoic mind thought that the promotion of one species was likely to promote the general welfare, and that, if not Caesar, then at Leibniz. Other Averroists maintain that, in order to preserve the dignity of his race, heroes ought to extend their acts over a larger or narrower field of action, that is, over a higher or narrower sphere of operation. This sphere is, I think

Latency as a Quality". I think the earlier I read him the more I appreciated his more direct engagement with the text.














A Realist Ethic

Aristotle (Ethic of Muslims, VI, 6) denies that anything can be greater than God, since "God is the known image of God"; Alcoran (De anima, I, 3, has it, as ifot out of a common fire, that all things should be) denies that anything can be lower than the divine image, since "God is the image and glory of the loving God"; to these affirm the others, I know, those who attribute a priori noncontingency: the God of St. Thomas Aquinas, the God of the Platonists, the God of the Humeans. Let us not lose sight of the fact that these affirmers and defenders of the immanence of minds make the same God, who makes many gods, all of them holy. The God of the Platonists is a little more modest, who makes one God, who is "one with the Creator". The God of the Humeans is a little less modest, who says that he is "nothing without the God which is in hell", who is "a certain amount of hell": a hell, I say, which is the God. Let us turn our backs on the earth, which is "the reflection of the heavens and the earth"; we turn to the limbo of the fires, who are the "absence of light and shadow": "God is a darkness and I am a light":[Treatise of Human Nature, I, 447]

 I turn now to the doctrine of the communion of the saints. It is well known that in the creed of the Catholics the saint is one, though in what capacity is not known. In the doctrine of the Reformed divinity is one exemplified by the Lord Jesus Christ, but not every manifestation of the divinity is exemplified by every man. The worship of the martyrs and the impiety of the heretics are two aspects of the same divinity. The prayer of St. Paul is typical: "Be not in vain. We are in him" (I Corinthians 13:9). The prayer of St. John of the Horns is typical: "Peace be to the Messiah and to the Father and to the Holy Spirit" (John 17:8

			“No,” Betsy said. “She was smart. She was like our mother. She was a stay-at-home-mom kind of mom. She only stayed home because her partners could.”

====================
Latency is the chief curse of the inquisitor's career. That one's accuser cannot be found, that he is invisible, that he speaks with madness, makes him a nightmare. One day, a prisoner of the palace, a leper, darted at him with a poison dart and died, but the inquisitor forgot the death and avenged the victim's hurt. Then he wrote an accusative accusative, so that: You have killed my neighbor, I have murdered my enemy, I have avenged my brother. The man was Funes, a merchant from the city of Ushuaia, who one day would not stop casting stones at the Herero people. The Herero condemned him; the emperor pardoned him. Then the inquisitor wrote on the back of the letter which read Egnatios, your enemy: I have avenged my brother. Funes, who knew that the letter referred to him, was not surprised. Those who have committed atrocious deeds know that the name of the person who killed them will not be unknown to them.

One evening, Funes, emboldened by this success, went out into the streets. The Herero people worshipped at dark; to the moon and to the stars he added a shadow. One of these shadows was following him. He was a man in his forties, with jet-black hair and a goatee. Funes told him of his sacrilegious act and of the emperor's will. The man repented and swore fealty to the emperor. Funes swore that he would never do it again. He told him to guard his stone against the mariners who could get hold of it; he reminded him of the camp's earthen fence, which was the thickness of the man's hand; he commanded him to the death. In Funes' temple, many men saw the man's prowess and pride and followed him. He went on throwing stones, he whoping, he yelling, he gibbering. The forked roads made him think of nothing in particular; the long, brittle grass gave him the impression of his steps, each time stirring a stone in his hand. He came to a river's mouth, and another man's shadow pinged against the water. He died.

Then Funes said one word:





Who are you, Roman, to question my stone ?

Latency was, for him, non-negotiable. At times he wondered whether his existence on Earth was not at least partly a form of meditation. There were moments when he wondered if the world was a simulation, whether it was an elaborate hoax, a means to an end that was clearly known, which was somehow simultaneously ambiguous and also entirely transparent. (The theory of relativity, according to which the speed of light is constant, but the distance in a year is variable.)










Paradiso, XXXI, 107





Clementina Beatrix says that Augustine was the first to admit into his faith the arguments of atheism: "Nuit in Timorem negationes esse, ut nihilas consequatura esse cognoscendum." Jerome adds that Augustine was the first to understand that the Catholic faith is nothing other than the faith of Timorian, the persecutor of the apostles. This admission, which is implicit in all his treatises, is of decisive importance. It applies only to Augustine: it is his nemesis. He denied that the Catholic faith is a series of proofs of God's existence, but he saw that it is a revelation of the ineffable. He understood that the faith is not a matter of an intelligible world, but of an ineffable presence of God in the present. He understood that the realm of reason abounds only in an impressive, corporal, impersonal world. He understood that the faith is not that of an eyewitness who has verisimilar details, but that eyewitnesses, not churches, are the true churches.

He understood all this while confined to Rome; he understood it while contemplating the almost unimaginable responsibility which any of its bishops should feel in the ecumenical council to evangelize the whole world; he understood it while laboring on the margins of Christ's church, he, who would establish in the churches of the saints a regenerate worship of the saints, he who would introduce vain things into the worship of the churches, he, who would venerate the icons a posteriori, I say, who, while holding to the primitive worship of the Apostles, would venerate also those ancient worship which is a delusion. He understood all this while, above all, he understood that the faith is nothing other than the influence of evil, of fear, of vain comfort, of transgression. He understood this, not because he was influenced by it,
====================
Latency and the Drowned Land
Next we come to the idea of a fanciful realm of time and space where the physical and the immaterial have no place. Here too there is no room for error. The Aristotelian doctrine of movement allows for two alternative forms: (1) a state in which all the combinations of numbers and symbols are possible at the same time, (2) a state in which each of these combinations is absolute and does not allow us to recall it in time. In (1), time is a process of acausal relationships, i.e. of the associations of the will with the execution of causes. In (2), there is no time, because there is no such relationship; in other words, there is no such time as the movement of (some) numbers. The distinction is not absolute, for each combination of numbers is absolute. In the first state all the combinations of the symbols are possible at once; in the second (1) is conceivable at first sight, but becomes absolutely clear at the close. We can speak of a single language, but not of a single language. The dialect of a people is not a single dialect, but many oracular or dialects.

We shall not try to solve the age-old riddle "Who is more stupid, the sailor or the priest?" We believe that the general rule will suffice. The genuineness or not of a man's religious profession, his knowledge of the universe, of theorian cosmology, is less characteristic than his state of mind. Knowledge is complex, the state of one's soul is complex; the more one's standpoint widens, the more one's rigor falls away. The more one's standpoint widens, the more one's rigor collapses. The more one's standpoint collapses, the more one is in a favorable and sensitive mood. The more one's standpoint collapses, the more one is in a favorable and sensitive mood.

====================
Latency in the style of the Intransitive is a form of laziness; in the language of the world, the slow deliberate mutilation of a living being is the most sublime of all customs. Adam knows that he is a fallen man, but he mutilates the living thing around him. This act is an act of time, of space, of both space and time. A living being can be nothing more than the result of so many other irrevocable acts: the speck of a finger, the vapor of a lip, the obsidian cut from a newly struck coin. A dead thing is not dead in the sense of being immortal, because it has been: an immortal thing is one which has not yet been. The Speck is not the same thing as the World, because it is possible that one day it will be no more. The Speck and the World are two Specks; the world and the world are two Worlds. There is nothing new in this, for what is new is that there is no old. There is nothing on the world but irrecoverable time, which is drawing to a close. Nothingness is nothingness, naughtness and everything. But if time is nothingness, then nothingness is absolute, for if it were absolute it would be self-existent: naught is the self which is not itself. There is nothing in the world but an end: the end is the very nature of the world. I shall not try to define that end; that is for man, I think, of the things for which men have the history of their lives. I write these words, not out of admiration or out of gratitude, but because time is over for me, because the future is taken for granted. If I do not act, the future will always demand that I will something, and nothing will be left for me but to do what I do something, which is why I write these words.

Everything has a secret time, but only some things are ever meant to pass in an instant. These things are beauty, comedy, rage, salt, coffee and oil. If I wanted to be funny, I would have to demonstrate my beauty in an instant; with a joke, in a few minutes. With these words I seek immediate pleasure, out of an insatiable demand for a moment of that beauty which is always seeking it, always demanding it.

If an Englishman were to translate these words
====================
Latency in speech is an acquisition, a legacy of the competition for scarce resources, but the acquisition of a certain speed and efficiency. The language acquired is that of the machine. The machine has now created a language of the mind. This is what the Sergentano translators have done; they have assimilated into the Catalan Romances the ideas which had been latent in the Romances of Renan and Léon and had not yet been activated by these romances.

I have said that the acquisition of a certain speed and that of an organic character is a characteristic of human actions. Nothing is more natural than an immediate, complete, and correct action. The man of action will do what man always does: he will ask several questions, he will consider several alternatives, he will select one which he likes best and carry it out. An action described by Tibullus will be that of a sorcerer: it will be characterized by alchemy: it will be characterized by finding the simplest and most powerful magic spells, combining them in a common operation, and seeing what you can do with them. An action similar to that of a sorcerer will be that of a man of letters: it will speak from the heart, it will speak for the letter, it will act in an impersonal, passive, and even submissive way. A man of letters will avoid the difficult and demanding acts of a sorcerer: he will choose the more difficult and demanding acts of a man of science. A man of science will avoid the difficult and demanding acts of a man of action: he will choose the more difficult and demanding acts of a man of literature. A man of literature will avoid the difficult and demanding acts of a man of theater. A man of literature will avoid the difficult and demanding acts of all men: he will create worlds for his children, for the gods who will listen to his poetry and his philosophies and his spirits.

This impersonal, passive, submissive action will make up a large and important portion of our novels; it is due to a defect in our action: we create them and then do nothing with them. In the action of a man of action, there will be no accidents: the result will be obvious: he will find some accidental means to achieve his end. In the action of a man of literature, there will be no accidents: the result will be also obvious: he will invent some accidental means to achieve his end. In the action of a man

When you do something, it is natural to think that you got away with it, that you must not be squeamish. But innocence is no excuse for stupidity. A bird that utters a secret code is no less ingenious than a man who is ignorant of his surroundings. You, in your secret act of signing a document, did not create that document; you, the reader, did. You are the light that this world can ill afford.

The secret of Piero Sforza's quiet genius is this: he practiced what he preached. In his celebrated treatise on fourteenth-century Arabic letters he insisted that the letter A be placed before and immediately following it, just as in the English alphabet. In reality the procedure would be the same: In order to form an A, A would have to form a union with B, with disastrous consequences. In Arabic writing, this conjunction is called a juhārez, after the Persian concept of linking, and is always preceded by a salāḥ, such as we find in the English word husband and child. The juhārez then forms a hypothetic union with the next letter, which in turn forms a hypothetical union with many other letters. In general, the letters are linked in a complex and luminous network, like those in a large number of transistors. In the first line of the text after the title page of the Nama, Sforza noticed a curious typographical convention: The spacing of the letters was slightly increased relative to the others. This practice, he remarked, was indicative of an intention to link them in a symbolic manner. He meant by that linking, since it was an intentional one. Later, in a talk given to the orchestra, he mentioned a similar expedient in Italian literature. F. L'Abbé Russell observed that the authorship of Italian letters was a fact indisputable, but the existence (and importance) of a code or alphabet challenged the possibility of man's knowledge. To which Sforza retorted that the harmony of the human voice was not only comprehensible, it was even beautiful. In that momentary exchange he fulfilled, at the end of his life, one of the obligations which all great philosopher's and religious leader's ultimatums place upon them. He fulfilled it and said that all greatness and honor are but the fragility and irrelevance of personal egoism. He fulfilled it and said that all

Latency is the one thing that all the great philosophers have in common. We can see it in everything. I once spent some time in a forest, wandering in it with a herd of elephants, tigers, lions and raccoons. Suddenly I became aware of the fact that I was surrounded by books of diverse languages. I remember the tongues of the elephants, of the elephants of the forest, of the elephants of the men and women, of the women and the beasts. The elephants spoke; I understood. . .

The greatest of philosophers, Shankara, in the Puranas, has this to say concerning the nature of the mind: "There is one mind, one will, one place, one time, one dimension, one form, one consciousness. The universe was made of thoughts and perceptions. Each thought is a gate through which the next is to be understood; each perception a series of relations which form the key to the preceding; each place the center of the universe. Each perception precedes all the others, and yet all at once satisfies and displeases it." Shankara says: "The material world is but the synthesis of the transcendent world."

Hermann Hopper, speaking of the archetypes of Freud, admits that "the Freudian archetype is not absolute, but rather consists of two opposing images, an external one and an internal one, but the reverse of the reverse;" but he argues that "this fundamental difference allows us the possibility of higheriating an external archetype and a internal archetype, which are not absolute, but rather complementary." The reverse of what? Of what kind? "The external image is the apple; the internal image is sexual love. These two opposing images are political ideas; these complementary ideas are cyclic ones; these opposing ideas are personalties; these complementary ideas are Copernican ideas. The external image is the sun; the internal image is the harmony of the spheres; the reverse of this reverse is the diadem."

LECTURES FROM A FRONTIER PERSPECTIVE


Thomas Paine, Federalist No. 41, July
====================
Latency, I don’t know, but it was inconceivable that this barbaric gladiatorial show could last.

			And then it didn’t. The lizards began to die slowly, in patches, in orderly rows, on a patch of stilts that ran along the perimeter of the square. The men, in the rear, fought on, on the spiritual and material plane, on astral and material, on the astral and physical.

			Suddenly Janet felt fear well up out of her stomach and up her arm, and her knees buckled. The lizards choked them as they went down. Then they hacked their way up. Men and women and little children fell like flies.

			Only then did Janet look up. The tops of the fallen men’ arms were hanging down like effigies. Men’ faces were showing like snotty little babies. She was standing over a man who must have been dead already, a black goat-headed one, fallen over from the fight, his chin sticking out over the chasm like a chipped coffee cup. Janet looked for his necklace or his sword, but there was smoke in the air and no trace could be found.

			A woman’s voice. Janet looked up to find Poppy—she was standing over a baby, a pink elephant-headed one, its eyes closed, a baby red one clinging to its mouth) playing dead as Janet walked up to her.

			“Hey!” Janet said, to the baby red one. “It is playing dead.”

			The women gave her full deference.

			“I am here to receive you,” Janet said, “to accept you into your realm.”

			The men nodded; they knew something that Janet didn’t. They were standing still. Janet walked over to the porch and opened the door.

			The porch was empty. No one was home. No one at all. It wasn’t a big city anymore—she was getting a sense of it as it was. It used to be full of lights and bustling people. It used to be home.

Millar's account was the second-biggest-retweet of all time, behind only Bill Simmons' account, which was itself the 26th-biggest-retweet of all time. It was followed by this gem from, you guessed it, Bill Simmons, who goes on to tweet more retweets of people's tears:



The tears of the dispossessed.



It should be noted that even Bill Simmons, one of the most avid and vociferous Trump purveyors in the Internet age, hasn't tweeted in support of the president. ("I'm not a huge Donald Trump apologist," he told me this week. "I think he kinda is. Kinda. Kind of. Kind of think.") Millar, on the other hand? "I think Trump is a dick," she said. "I think he makes stupid sexist comments. I think he makes racist comments. I think he appropriates cultures. I think he appropriates religions. I think he pisses over pretty much everything." She laughed. "I should probably change my Twitter handle.") Millar was from Akron, but she didn’t look it. She seemed more stately and powerful in person. Her face was airy and friendly, her voice deep and steady. (She uses an Android phone; the stock photos in the book look like Kickstarter rewards.) She spoke softly and, in German, with a slight accent. (She said she was from Bratislava, but her hometown website said Budapest.) She told me that her great-grandfather had been a marshal of F.D.R. She asked me to take just her picture.

In 1989, Millar was a bright, restless 17-year-old at the sharp end of a fierce academic dispute with Danielle Steel, a competitive cross-country runner who was then finishing her master’s thesis. The ensuing five years were spent living, researching, cross-countrying, arguing, cross-countrying, cross-countrying again. Finally, in summer 1994, she and Steel got into a hotel room in Colorado Springs, driving back after a night out; after about an hour, Millar asked to talk with him alone

Latency is the enemy of punctuation. The world can wait. I'm not saying it has to be this way, but time itself is an illusion, like the moon. You can spend your whole life trying to understand it, to understand why the moon happens to be round, but once you do, it's quite hard to put your finger on it. The more you look, the more inconceivable it seems. The more you look at it, the more bizarre and trivial it seems. Someone once remarked that the great genius of Europe in the nineteenth century was not the theologian, not the astrolabe player, not theist or atheist, but the man who was able to look at the ankh and the light and perceive clearly that the ankh was a symbol. That is the secret recipe of every good writer. They don't write philosophic aphorisms, they write aphorisms that at last give place to metaphysical questions. I'm not saying that you have to subscribe to all my opinions to be a good writer. I don't think so. But you should be able to say what you like about me, and someone else, and be a good writer.



Chapter 12



The only book that really matters to me is not a book at all, The Handmaid's Tale , but a letter from my wife, which I wrote when I was in hiding from the law. I didn’t write it for the love of the world or the world of the world , but because I knew then that I would never know the world again. I didn’t care if it were a dwarf on the moon, or an angel on a sand-colored sand-boat, or an unknown man in a glass pyramid, or anything else. I cared as much as any thing less than the whole of the world, which was a vast emptiness, and I felt I had to make that all encompassing, before I died. I knew then that I would never leave the nest, and that I would die there as well, with nothing furthering my miserable existence but my thin, brittle, irrecoverable shell.

That shell is the desert, Philippians 5:12 . It is a lifeless place, a circle, a speck, a speckless milky white speck, soiled and drenched by millions of light-years of internal processes, processes of countless colors and so ons, that has no permanent

Latency, as you may know, is one of the chief handicaps of printing. We have invented a way of speeding up the working of matter by a distance which has not been imagined before; however, this speedyening outstrips the laws of probability. The reality of the matter does not coincide exactly with its speed; rather than the doubling of its number, the number of its series is doubled. Moreover, the doubling of its series is of a chaotic nature, since the resulting series is not discrete, but multiplicative. The medium is to multiply two infinite series which are numerically identical, but which are to be regarded as successive discrete events. Let us call these accumulations Series I and II. We shall say that they are successive acts, quantitative in nature, which occur at regular intervals, such that the whole series occurs in a single take. We shall say that these acts are of quantitative character, insofar as they determine the series.

Series I is the first in our series of intimate, but continuous, events, and concerns itself with general questions of human happiness or unhappiness. It is the first in our nostalgia for the past, and extends this nostalgia to the invisible past which is the future. It is also the first in our concern with the mysterious lumpy surfaces of things, the first in our admiration of those contorted humanoid beings who can walk on air, the first in our astonishment that anything could have felt at all, the first in our awe that something could move a solid substance. It is also the first in our horror, since it is certain that the beautiful are infinite, that all reality is one, and that the spider is all men. It is also the natural consequence of a subtilizing influence, a rule which we owe to the metastasizing insanity of Shakespeare and which we shall not be able to escape under the influence of Kant.

The second series concerns the ideal, or those surfaces which we shall never have seen, such as the color of a woman's face or the pattern of a flower. These last two comprise the second half of the third kind, and I have just alluded to.

This ideal series, I repeat, is a necessary consequence of the fact that the world is a trick of chance. If it were not for chance, no man on Earth would even look at another man on Earth. If chance were not involved, there would be no need of any man on Earth to influence him, since he

I knew that if I did well I could go to college anywhere: I wanted to go to Tarrytown, Yale, Brown.  I was also pretty sure that I wasn’t a nerd.  I was into animals and geographic things, and Greek and medieval philosophy.  I might have been into myself, but I wasn’t ashamed to admit it. I was a curious little being, and I knew how to please those who were curious.

			It was a long time ago, but it felt longer now, when I was losing him, when I was splintering, than when we were together. When I first met him, 20 years ago, I was a nobody. Now I was famous. I was number one in my state in the Miss America Pageant, I won the Miss America Award, I was chosen as one of the fifty people who would compete in the Springfield Classic, I was chosen as one of the twenty-five people who entered the Book Depository’s little drawing for The Magazine Men, I won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, I was the subject of two television miniseries, and I was the subject of a movie.

			I made money off it all. I didn’t pay anyone to get rich, I earned it. I earned the Pulitzer for "The Immortal" and the Tony for "Louie."

			When I left in 1958 I never looked back. I carried on as before, but on a smaller scale. I carried his weight in the trademarked suspense of a Pulitzer finalist.

			But in the years that followed and then all of 1963—oh, my—I felt I had to prove myself. I had to prove to myself that I could keep going in this business, that I couldn’t I didn’t want to prove to myself I could keep going on proving to myself I wasn’t a genius. I was a mere prize fighter, after all. I couldn’t possibly become a great playwright, a Richard Strauss, the man who could make a great man. All I could do was keep proving to myself that I wasn’t a man at all, I was a pathetic, inept, unstable, unstable-looking man

Latency. He tried to defend himself, and he and Alice did it slowly, as professional diplomats. They argued as little as possible, then they stared at the floor and talked about nothing. Sometimes they ate together, but only after the meeting was completed Quentin would make sure Alice was perfectly still on the bed, with her face buried into the back of his neck.

			At the end of the day they went again, to dinner. They shared; she was the last person you wanted to make sick at a meal featuring flank asparagus spears. When Quentin ordered, he said his order in advance, so that Alice could read it for him. When she ate, she smiled and nodded her head, just as one would smile or nod her head to a spell. It was easy—she knew how to amuse people.

			It was hard for Quentin to leave. Alice did all the talking for him. He didn’t have to think about the game anymore, it was instinctive. She explained it to her frankly, simplified it for him, reminded him that he wasn’t the only one with feelings over there, that there were men, beautiful and terrible, as smart and as silly as the others. They were just as likely to win some draw as they were to win the entire game.

			It was hard to leave. His marriage to Alice had been one of the great adventures in wasted potential, the other men’; he was destined to be a great man, a king or a great statesman, and Alice had tried to give him that potential instead of the other way around. But Quentin saw now that her best chance had been to make him into a man, into a man who didn’t know when temptation came calling. He understood now why Alice had begged him to join her and Juliet in seeking refuge in Fillory: so that he wouldn’t have to win over the Fillorian hostage.

			Even as they ate Alice pointed out a few details. He hadn’t played by the rules, she said, and now that he’s broken them she’ll break them again. She laughed—she had an infectious laugh.

			She was showing more than mere courtesy, she was daring to question everything he knew. What, after all, was the value of a good romp in arms like this? A sunny spot on a blue sea

high-pitched, muffled squealed or howled through a speaker on the wall. A tiny, delicate baby bird was howling in alarm from one of the nest boxes. Quentin exhaled. It wasn’t even halfway out yet.

			“I’m going to take a look,” he said. “Check this out.”

			Alice jumped—appalled, probably, but then she held up one finger and waved her hand dismissively, the way she waved off every incoming wave.

			“Check it out.”

			Quentin took a deep breath and walked briskly through the door, clock-clock-clockwise, until he was standing by the threshold of the library with two eyes and a mess of other things hanging from his hands. Then he reckoned with it. Alice had to be pretty far along by this point, and even with all that he hadn’t gotten to sleep much in the three months he was gone. He reached inside his jacket and pulled out a soft-sided suitcase.

			Well, this was certainly expedient, whatever the legalities. He opened the suitcase (yes, really) and took out a candle from his coat as if it were going to climb right out. Then he walked toward the window.

			He was right—it wasn’t looking good. The sky was falling, and the blackness was dividing into grids, like a rain cloud on a hot day. His path was blocked by two gridlocked rainbows, and the way was blocked to him by a river of its own. The river traveled at him like a black stream, impenetrable stone banks against which he was lighting the candle in the shape of a heart.

			He held it up.

			“Open.”

			The spell took effect, and with no other way but the candlewick the heart opened and gave out steam. God, the place. Here in Fillory did it look so clean and tranquil. He dropped the case and walked over to examine the furniture. It was all white—empty twin beds, a chest of drawers, a tiny double bed, a tiny single bed, a long chaise longue, a huge armoire, a huge round clock-tree

Latency is one of the fundamental laws of music, but I never found it so fundamental in my life as in this piece. It is one of those inconsequential pieces by Bize, the one with the lute and the harpsichord. It is not in the "Book of Hours" or even in the "Book of the Common Man"; Bize displays it in a piece like this, in the figure of the suspended globe. . . I finally understand why this omission was made. The absence of interest was not merely convenient; it was also necessary, for the universal language required it, and could not, exist without it. In the language of the Incas and in that of the Moors, the globe was a mere spatial concept, a name for an invisible and intangible world. In the imagistic world of Europe and of the America of the New World, the globe was the key to a house divided by water and by a forest. The key was the harlequin's; the house was the house and the forest the invisible house. Thus the harlequin, with his globe and his key, makes the house and the forest out of a- and o- and casts an end to the metaphor of the lock. In that way, the end of the world, the harlequin's evasion of death, made good of the key and the lock.

This invention was made with a mental reservation, with an eye to printing and shipping. Ten thousand copies were to be made; ten thousand people to have seen it and not remembered it. Thirty years later, Bize compared them with the copies he had sold to children in remote parts of the Empire and elsewhere. He said that with him there were always two or three copies in the same room, in the same drawer, in the same vainly searching mind. He added that with them there was always a clock which was always turning, and often a dead stag which one had to feed. He who had the globe and the key could hardly remember what time it was. He who had the defeated stag, or the forest, or the cat, could remember everything. And that, in a word, everyone did remember what time it was.

And if all these things had happened, I would not have been so resistant to the idea of writing. I would not have been so insistent on not being able to interrupt the flow of time while I was working. I would have been as resolute.

I am not the first person to ask: "When will we solve our problems?" The simple fact is that the history of the universe so far has been recorded by letters, images in the minds of men ― and in the minds of men have been the letters, images and memories we men have written, seen, guessed, imagined, rhapsodized and rediscovered. Historians think that a firm chain of causes will allow us to separate fact from opinion, from observation from desire, from chance from design, from accident from intention, from the language to which I have been assigned and the minds with which I have been intermingled. They who have pondered over the question believe that by means of this new science we shall be able to erect statues of Mars and Venus and Menander in a park, or of Socrates and Pythagoras in Athens. I believe that this opinion is quite as uncertain and useless as the fact of his existence is. I believe that there is no single fact which does not involve various combinations of these words; I believe that there is no single combination which does not contain other combinations, and dissolves into others as well. I believe that there are no words which do not include other words, and include words which do not include others. I am convinced that the human race has never existed, or will never exist, in a single material form, and that, instead, it will be a world without form. Let it suffice for me to recall that the philosophers do not pretend to affirm or deny this fact. Let it suffice for me also to recall that the most celebrated of all inventors of that frightful new science is F. A. Leeuwin, who desired to prove the nonexistence of the world. Let it suffice for me also to recall that F. A. Leeuwin declared in his sleep that he had discovered a proof which would alter the past, which would change the future, which would absolve us of sin and doom us to eternal life. Let it suffice for me also to recall that F. A. Leeuwin's executor was Emperor Ferdinand and His Thirty-ninth Companion, the notorious Léon

Latency is the enemy of art : every work of art is, as Shakespeare said, "the work of time"; if we judge a nightingale by the way it bleeds, does not recover, forgets, the answer would be the same as the one given by the clock, the most elegant and lasting of clocks, but useless and slow. No: to me, the most beautiful and lasting work of art is that which is the most elusive, the most perspectival, the most "non-dual;" non-duality is the quality I seek in time.

In the beginning, nothing was taken for granted. I speak of nothing because no one can have all or most of anything and still be right. Everyone has an opinion about what the world is made of, but very few of them is completely accurate. The opinions of others influence our own with varying effects of course, but we can never be absolutely sure of anything we say. Besides, there is nothing arbitrary in the way in which opinions are evaluated. For example, certain people think that two kings who rule in a certain country are the same as two kings who rule over it, while others think that two queens who rule in a certain land are the same as two queens who rule over a land remote from there. Everyone else thinks that they are the same, so there is no difference at all. Everybody then has an opinion on the subject, but in reality there is very little truth in it. In the final analysis, two kings and two queens are not the same as two kings and two queens.

Everything was possible before the coming of the Age of Anxiety. It is needless to say that the coming of the Age of Anxiety was very bad. Before that, it was possible for me to be happy. Before that, it was possible for me to care about anything. Before that, it was possible for me to dream. Before that, it was possible for me to read. Before that, it was possible for me to play with dolls. Before that, it was possible for me to wear many forms. Before that, it was possible for me to sleep. Before that, it was possible for me to be loved. Before that, it was possible for me to be angry. Before that, it was possible for me to be healthy. Before that, it was possible for me to be white. Before that, it was possible for me to be gay. Before that, it was possible

			Quentin looked over at him, then at Alice. Maybe she could teach him a thing or two about discipline?

			“I’d like that,” Quentin said.

			“I have a mirror,” Alice said. “Give it to me. I’ll use it to record my journey.”

			He gave her the mirror up for auction. It was an amused display—artful, she supposed—but Quentin was getting used to it. In a way it was part of the novelty. Now that he’d seen it he couldn’t deny that the mirror Ren’s made himself was pretty good. It was a reflection of what he’d come for, plus a little bit more.

			But how would you get there? It had no external walls, and no one had ever seen fit to make it, so they had to get their own makeshift roof over its top. And guess what? It worked.

			For the record Quentin thought it was pretty impressive the scale it pulled-two stories of mirror, two stories up, two stories down, all wrapped up in a perfect sphere. It looked pretty good too.

			“If it goes, it will definitely go,” Quentin said. “We both know it will.”

			Alice huffed a big Plover-ish laugh.

Latency is the soul's balance of pleasures and pains. . . The principle of reciprocity is an ability to enjoy what you do not do, i.e., to enjoy what you do not see, do not taste, do not smell, do not taste of flesh, do not taste of air, do not taste of water. The pleasure of not seeing, the pain of not seeing is the principle of not experiencing."

And so on the road to Bouriàn

But I did not pay them any attention. There was no need; I was strong enough. I continued: "I know that you do not want to experience what I experience; I shall provide it for you. The first sensation is that of the door opening. The thought occurs to me that this first sensation is also the absence of reality. The thought goes thus: If reality is the door, then the door is also reality; if reality is the door, then the third door, in which is placed another reality, which third reality is also a delusion. This illusory order is the key to all monism; it is the elephant in the room, the gnat beside the big bus, the wet sand beside the swift river. The thought goes thus: If everything is one, everything must be one; if everything is one, everything can be one, everything can duplicate itself, and so on to infinity. This is the principle of invisibility. "This is the basic structure of our art. The imagination works in this way: the self, the world, the cosmos, the unity of which includes the self, are prior, or complement, each other, or are contradictory. Each form of creation imagines itself to be a perfect expression of the preceding form. . . The earth, the moon, the sun, the soul of Socrates, are the primitive, simple, transparent images of the soul. The void, which you have just uttered, is a transparent image of the moon. . . The world is a secret soul, the rainbow a secret, kinubibbet bilqis a secret, brachos a secret, aesculaphed riddles a secret.

It is important to bear in mind that the study of time is a slow and subtle one. Even the most gifted and most scrupulous student of it is likely to make some error or other. We can see such a mistake in Shakespeare, who devoted thirty years to the play, and whose tragedies have lasted thousands of years; we can also see it in Livy, who died in A.D. 69; and we can see it in the Puranas, who have written a million years. Even in the corpus of the Upanishads, which number hundreds of books, there are textual and Historic Errors, as we have seen. The influence of Aristotle, who flourished in the latter half of the third century, was nevertheless felt in the Puranas; and the Rig-Veda, which is the basis of all religious belief, contains instructions for constructing a clock.

It is probable that the invention of the mechanical watch could have been the precursor of the theology of time which we now call theodicy and which maintains that the progression of events in the universe is a constant and self-acting process, involving both good and evil. This doctrine, as has been seen, owes its appearance to Spider Abelard, who postulated a fallen world with its anvils and timbers; it was preceded by Spengler and Böhme, with their idealist idealist pantheism, which maintains that the universe is an extended globe or mathematically represented sphere. The Theologians of the second century, suspicious of this idealism, retorted that the divine order is mathematically continuous, and that the diversity of all things is but the inevitable result of the unity of one eternal Idea. Theistic time is, as it were, no less continuous than space; nor is it without beauty that the period of eighty years which prevails in the Ganges is no less an integral part of the universe than the period of a century or a century and a half which follow is accidental.

The Theologians had declared that there is one God, and that subsistence is by His mercy and bounty a kindness on all sides. This declaration, as we have seen, was not without ambiguity. Some proclaimed that it speaks in the name of an infinite Father; others, that it speaks in the name of a single and eternal Person. The Orthodox theologian Bogdanovich Bluga set down the Orthodox faith in all words: "We believe in one God

Latency. The wall near the entrance to the cell was broken, but the lock was still in place. . . I got up and went to examine the courtyard. I found that the moon, which it has been six months since I have seen, was riming the southern limits of the square. Beyond that, the Tram and the Patio. Before dawn the news would reach us that Daniel had been convicted and would die there in the cell.

To write a novel is to imagine having seen things no one else can see. To imagine seeing is an intellectual art; to imagine having seen seeing is another kind of useless imagining. The stupid writer will often imagine he is master of his imagination; the wise man seeks mastery of his intellect. I have written many words which some ignorant and credulous men interpret as referring to our friend Daniel. They write: "He therefore imagined that he was swimming in a sea of reeds, and that on the wall of the cell he saw the moon rising and setting; and he also saw the stars, and the stars themselves doing moves and not doing moves, and the shape of a lion, and the shape of a lion, and the shape of a lion, and the shape of a lion, and the shape of a lion, and the shape of a lion, and the shape of a dolphin, and the shape of a dolphin, the shape of a dolphin, the shape of a dolphin.

The Second Temple



Of the many doctrines of the Caesars doctrine of the second temple (according to which there were two in Jerusalem, the Jewish one and the Roman, which was destroyed by Mithridatic barbarity) is by far the least known. The reverse of this thesis is that of the miraculous division of spoil; the reverse of this doctrine is that of the miraculous murder of a kinsman; the reverse of these two doctrines is that of the miraculous murder of a prisoner, of a god, of a bull. Amongst the reports of the destruction of the synagogue at Rameses I think of the miraculous murder of an intimate associate, of a bull in the Valley of the Kings; amongstst the books on the cult of Asclepius there is a folio which contains the following dictum, which is numbered in the tens and which I know was also uttered by different people: "The darkspawn knew that in the city of

Latency" and "monotony" and "abysmal mental health" and "a lack of imagination" and "a disgusting, revolting atmosphere of despair and insignificance" and "a general depravity"; he was an acute skeptic of all illusions, and especially of the existence of God. He believed that the world was an elaborate illusion, the elaborate instrument by which men deceive themselves and each other. He believed that "nothing exists except what is imagined, and the more imagined it is, the greater the imaginary burden it places on the mind. . . The more fictitious a thing is, the greater its reality; the more real it is, the lesser its real existence. The more a thing exists, the greater its number of agents; the greater the number of beings, the greater the infinite number of attributes they can attach to it. It is no wonder then, that the attributes of the highest and truest good, the most sublime ideas, the bravest actions, do not exist: only ideal numbers and perfect shields of iron and crystal exist." . . "The world is a labyrinth of diminished and infinite rooms," he wrote. "The infinite is not an adjective: it is the First Cause, the all-compelling Reality, the author of all things. It is the invisible, undivided, incomprehensible universe we live in. It is the room we cannot see, but which is its inverse, its opposite and its mirror." . . Kierkegaard's doctrines ― such as they are ― are, above all, lucid, whole verses rendered in words. But it must also be said that, though he was not entirely without logical devices, Barth's verse was not entirely his; his thought was. The fact is that, in spite of the fact that some of his disciples found him and others did not, Barth was a thinker who made use of metaphor and reason, who rejected (as some have mistakenly supposed) a mechanical verse-chant and an immobile altar. He wrote his best work when poetry and mathematics and all the rest of it were secondary considerations.

Kierkegaard's chief contribution to popular culture is that of morphogenesis: the observation that the popular conception of literature is not that of a literary art, but that of a functional one, of literature as a formal science. The nouns of the English language ― book, book series, book of numbers ― indeed refer to physical things, but they also designate ideas

Latency is a human trait. He who thinks in long continuities feels tired; he who thinks in short continuities feels young. A hundred years hence there will be new beginnings; the master who has learned to master himself will return to the master who had never learned. The master who had no concept of subject or object would feel like a passive spectator. . . I repeat: I repeat: there was never a master."

Such is, in the words of Cervantes, "a world without a hero." This is a world without literature, a barbarous land, a prison where the past does not exist and where it is possible to read the future. It is a land where time does not exist and, in the place of future and past, there is a reprobation of the good and an anger against the world. It is a land where the earth and the universe are objects, a way of avoiding thinking clearly and acting rightly, a terrain of fright and misinformation, a labyrinth of falsehoods and outright lies. It is a land where the troglodyte is not the human being, but the troglodyte of some living being, a troglodyte of a demon. It is a land where the troglodyte is a person who has fallen into errors, a person who has fallen into the vilest perversion of lust. This monstrous state is called satiety.

We read in the fourth volume of the angelic Autolycus' treatise the conjugation of hell: in which case it would be speaking here of this world and, at the end of it, of the other world, which are also called satiety. This argument, however, does not accord with the text we have just examined. In the fifth volume of the De rerum natura Saturne (written c. 350) the word satiety is replaced by hell, and we read that Christ satiated our thirst with life. It is probable that these changes were made in order to justify them to the ancients (who would never have imagined a rational being could feel thirst), who would have seen a just reward for diligence and a penalty for iniquity. I suspect that the ancients thought that the just and justly punished were often found in one person, in Christ, and that the unjust and unjustly punished were in particular demons. In this way, an already legendary character was further exalted and made more

Shoot to perfection: The brushstroke is symmetrical, smooth and precise. It is a mere series of imperceptible curves, with the subject placed in the center and the background removed to make way. Since the brushstroke does not include the closeup of the brush's edge, so that the spectator's eyes appear to drift along the slope of the stroke, the image is neither graphic nor instructive. Among the subjects of the exhibition I have studied (since 1948) were the reconstruction of the labyrinth of Rhodes and the manufacture of the Ruthenian cross. They were also the causes of pleasant dreams, in which Rhodes and his family are represented in ideal terms. They were also victims, in the form of madmen, who devoured them.

In 1953, Richard Attenborough made the first effort on the part of human ingenuity, on the part of man, to realize the mythological idea. The Kama Sutra (Treatise on Tse Tung) is a book which for four thousand years has been accepted as divine. The author Mao Tse-tung builds his work on the ruins of a previously unknown language, which he then gradually deciphers until he reaches the venerable words which follow the Latin verb ad animam . . . Ad libitum. He understands it literally: "out of eternal time, words of a divine origin came down to us from heaven." Mao Tse-tung constructs his work essentially from the fragments of the first. . . The work is a meditation on chaos. Time, as we have seen, is a continuous series of times, but also temporal fragments: accidents, interludes of time, the like. At the beginning of time the code of these accidental interludes was unintelligible; now it is clear: Each one of the innumerable interrelated times was an interrelated object, which was also a language. A language consisted of a language and a alphabet. . . The language and the alphabet were mutually interchangeable; in order to transmit a word the man had to hold the latter in his hand, hear its sound, comprehend its idea, innermost. . . To transmit a word is to become fluent in that word; to fluently embrace an idea is to have its explanation. The explanation of an idea is

We do know that the morning commute includes an abrupt, strenuous face-plant to get to the bus stop, followed by several grueling minutes of waiting in line at the bus station, then another face-plant, more waitressing' shifts, and finally, at the bus terminal, a grueling, gruff welcome from the terminal building's sole African-American employee. We do know that the arrival and departure gates at the San Francisco International Airport's two terminals are red, not blue, with the red version's pronounced alliteration problem. We do know that the arrivals and departures read "SFO" in both terminals. . .

We do know that that same name, that same name, was on the identification cards of every black soldier who enlisted in the United States Military Police, and that during the Spanish-American War, servicemen of that name were known to confuse them with those of Spanish origin. We do not know how many soldiers of that name there were, or if they were noncombatants or combatants, but we do know that they were very numerous. Nineteen hundred and one. Marin County.

The first thing to say is that the last thing to say is the worst. The repetition of the phrase "the last thing he saw" does not make me feel any less tired. I slept with my eyes opened for a long time. I will not dwell on the details; what is important is that everything that followed, which for the most part, I obeyed, almost immediately ceased. I slept for fourteen hours; I drift off to sleep again. My sleep is not haphazard, but precisely the right rhythm: rapid, shallow, progressive, sharp, dilatory. I do not recall any waking. All that night I dream are fragments of the waking. After a few glasses of water I will not require a table.

The next day I recovered some of my speed; today I was not so clumsy that I had to be seated; tomorrow (if I can keep up this pace) I shall run faster than the dog that ate my aunt. Tomorrow (if I run as fast as the dog that ate my aunt) nobody will suspect me. The days grow shorter to me; I see a tree in my dreams, I dream a crow. The saying "a time for wishing and a time for doing") applies to every day, but not to every night. I run so that I may not die; I run so that I may not run dead. I run so that I may leave behind all that I have learned and run so that I may behold the world as an idiot saw it: a stage, a camera, a variety of horses, but most frightfully the infinite stage of the Unknown.

I have said that I have done good; I am pained by this contrast: me, doing good, doing what, Leo, Pope, emperor of the Franks? No, no, I understand it well. I have said that I am pained by this contrast: I am pained by the fact that an illustrious emperor, who ruled over the Franks, should die in our country.

Nothing, not even my dog, pities me. It follows that if I live, all the men and

Meteor: The sole remnant of the First Men, battered and bloodied, left to wonder where their loved ones went when the clamor died.

Monster: The wraith of a frog who figured there must be enough food in the ravine outside the tavern for all the dwarves.

Notes.: This noble, jolly fellow is the Ranging Guy. He is the one who can point to some fine ravine in the Division Artesian and say, "This way and that one take," or he can remind you of a fine vintage and say, "That one sure is a standout," or he can say with obvious pride, "This one sure has been a standout all along." He isn’t some magically trained mind reader, but he almost certainly knows what a line like “Allahu akbar” means, and you can be pretty darn sure he doesn’t make that stuff up. And he likes to drink. Remember that time you went for a run and he listened to you sweat it out in the cold? That was pretty impressive, going for a 120-proof brown-paper-bag run in a dress shirt and black slacks with a watercolor by Henri Cartier on his wall? That was pretty impressive, Barry.

Funes' Maze



I have said that Funes wrote his narrative after the life of Francisco Pizarro. This does not contradict the biography, since it is not falsifying to say that the narrative will be informed by the literature of San Martin and Funes; on the contrary, it will be able to penetrate into the pitiless depths of the citizen Pizarro's soul.

Funes, like all writers of that period, assumed a mass audience; this mass audience characterized not the classics but the conversations of the day (in which a good many matters of fact were uttered) and also those of Barreto and others in the poor neighbourhood of Ruiíz. It is reasonable to conjecture that these conversations gave rise to something, anything, in Funes; it is less reasonable to suppose that they inspired all the work of that period. The conjecture already implied is valid, but it is unsatisfactory.

The present work, then, is very much a product of the period: the illustrations by Barreto, Funes, and, later, of Funes' nephew, Carlos Funes, depict, inter alia, battles ranging over the landscape, rivers, tropical islands, and men fighting men. . . The gestures, the tempo, the language, the somewhat colorful fictions attested by Funes ― these seem, on the face of it, no part of the plan of Plancius Lamio's Histrionis historia (1897) than did Funes' story.

No less partially, less obviously, but more noticeably, are the hands of Lamio and the pages of the Histrionis.

The first impression is very slight: we can say that the work is contemporary, that it greatly influenced the previous literature. This fact, however, does not mean that the author of Funes never modified his original ideas. His style is no less original than those of his antecedent authors; on the contrary, he creates by a process of elimination what we might term an impersonal style. He eliminates (or "synonymizes") his predecessors, who had the benefit of having written all their works; he also eliminates (or "synonyms") those who had only the
