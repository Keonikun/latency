Dialog: "No one is exempt from the dominion of Satan. He seeks to corrupt the minds, bodies and spirits of men; he instills in them foolish desires and errors; he corrupts the conscience and arm of every man. . ."

This passage, which can be found in the first edition of the work De regenera hereinafter cited, has been rediscovered by the translator, Rev. F. J. Reid, in the present volume. He locates its authentic context in a letter written by the holy Bede to Cornelius Verus, Bishop of Ephesus, some four hundred years ago. The following is the pertinent portion of the letter, which we extract verbatim:



"I have now examined into the subject with some certainty, and find that it is true. I know that there are men who would deny and attack this statement, men who would deny the very notion of a corruptible human nature, and pretend that the very idea of a tree is a man; I ask of you, Reader, what right have we to judge such absurdities? Are we not all agents of our wills? Are we not all under the influence of the same Evil, which is that of destroying the good things of this world? Do not I declare (I pray you, forgive me if I repeat) that the tree which corrupts the men who enjoy its fruit is really a man? Do not I declare that the tree which corrupts the tree which inheres in the blood, is really an immortal spirit? Know, Reader, that all this I write, to declare and declare yet further; and that, just as the fire consumes the wood, so the fire consumes the tree which inheres in the soul, just as the fire consumes the immortal fire that supports it, just as the tree which corrupts the men who enjoy the fruit, really is, in a certain way, the fruit of that tree. . ."



Mr. Reid's translation, which is one which I have just completed, would not have satisfied me if it did not contain a few imperfections. One glaring example is this (paragraph four):



"This doctrine, then, that the soul, like the body, is both passive and active, is the very opposite of the true one, which says that the two terms signify the same thing. The soul, say some, actually comprises every particle of matter; the body, a spirit either

I. THE FORTRESS OF METAPHYSICS

The first difficulty is of a nature which no one can ignore: namely, the complete and total absence of a test by which we can judge the adequacy or the irrelevance of an assertion. There can be no truth or falsehood, for what can be truthfully said about a tree or a dog or a plank of wood which no one has seen, no one has touched, no one has touched is also truthfully said about an assertion, an assertion about a tree or a dog or a plank of wood which everyone has seen and which nobody has ever had the misfortune to see or touch. To evaluate these supposedly incommensurable and precluded facts is the business of metaphysicians; the task assigned to me is limited to suggesting that, in the first place, the following facts, when put up against the first one, amount to manifestly false and prejudicial falsehood: a. That when two things are put up against each other, the one which is taken for greater in the set will eventually win out. This seems to me incommensurable, since it would mean that the set of things which is best in the world in general is also best in each and every individual world of Habsburg Spain; on the other hand, it amounts to nothing more than a circular argument, since it seems axiomatic that the statements "the moon is blue" and "the sun is the blue of the moon" are true in two different instances, but false in the other two. It is, perhaps, more probable that the statements "the moon is blue" and "the sun are blue" are true in two different instances, but false in one single instance, so that the

Dialog, or the second, which is a query of the first.

Of the dialects of Turkey there are three which I shall mention: the Northern, the Southern, and the Euphoriantian.

The Northern dialect, spoken by the Alans, Alevis, Bohemians, Armenians, and Swiss in that order, begins with the vowel L, moves to the final S, that is, to the S of the Hebrews; it also has the particle -ī, which signifies "among the Armenians"; it is also called after the river Dan, after the cemetery of the Armenians, where the battles of the Greeks are kept; the name of this Northern Armenian cemetery is Trebizond.

The Southern dialect, spoken by the Alans, Basques, Catalan, English in that order, begins with the vowel T, moves to the final G, that is, to the Gnostic Gnosticism; it also has the particle -ī, which signifies "in the churches of the Basques," and also in those of the Basques, where the Basques' churches are kept.

The third dialect, the one spoken by the Jews, begins with the vowel Z, moves to the final S; it also has the particle -ō, which signifies "among the Sephardic Jews."

These three dialects, spoken on different continents, communicate by sea their multiform languages; but the language which communicates itself least is, perhaps, that of the Hindus. They speak a language of many roots; the word root, which in the tongue of the whites signifies any one of many organic terms, in the language of the Hindus signifies nothing but the union of words, which in this case is the union of words with prepositions. Thus, Svarupa means "the one who drinks wine," and Śrīya "the one who drinks once." Thus, pulao means "in the palace of the queen," and prajña "in the courtyard of the queen." Thus, praupa "in the royal palace" and praupaḥ "in the courtyard of the queen." Thus, praupaḥḥ "in the palace of the queen" and not "in the courtyard of the queen."

Perhaps the word Babel does not refer to me, but to some nation, and that nation to that nation, and so on to that nation. Perhaps the word I use is universal, and I am not unique, but the expression, 'all languages but the Tongue' is merely a description of one language, the Tongue. Perhaps there is a universal grammar, in which all languages are represented, and all men are equal, and that universal grammar is quite different from my own. Perhaps all men are created specula- tively in the image of a single man, and that man is Jl, the Animal. Perhaps all men are animals, and the general, round about the twelfth, represents the imperfect, as the eleventh represents the incomprehensible. Perhaps the general represents the animal in speech, and that animal in action. Perhaps that universal image of which I have spoken, and which I will speak, is the image of a religion, and the fundamental doctrines of that religion are, I imagine, identical with those of all the religions of the world. I do not know whether that universal image is solid, fluid, material, and if so, in what solid, medium, form or substance that image may be made? I know that that universal image can consist of a dog, of a horse, of a brain, of a horse's skull, of a brain's flesh, of a brain's blood, of a brain's fire, of a brain's bones, of a brain's memories, of a brain's dreams, of a brain's peculars, of a brain's peculars, of a brain's dreams, of a brain's dreams, of a brain's dreams, of a brain's peculars, of a brain's dreams, of a brain's peculars, of a brain's dreams, of a brain's peculars, of a brain's dreams, of a brain's dreams, of a brain's peculars, of a brain's dreams, of a brain's dreams, of a brain's dreams, of a brain's dreams. . ."

We can now compare the two. I have chosen the line, "The line number A1 to B1 is 1010."</p>

I have chosen the line, "The line number A1 to B1 is 1010."</div>

The lines are very similar, but the following difference stands out: the first number is a pure number, divisible by 0, the other by 1; the second number is divisible by 10 and is not a pure number; the second number is a compound of the first two numbers. The first number is always a perfect number; the second number is an imperfect number. The first number is always the same; the second number varies according to the first number.

Let us consider the example of the number 1010. It would be absurd to compare this number with those other than 101 to be sure that they are not numbers not to be compared with numbers not to be compared with 10,000. In all probability, the first 1001 specimens of the phylum Antirmes will be identical with those of the phylum Tetrachromatis, those with which the alchemists Leucippus and Porphyry composed their Anabasis and Mycenaean Geometers. The differences will not be subtle: they will be obvious. The following are some of them:

The first one, the one from the hymnbook of the cathedral, has the quality of representing the Elemental Substance as white, fluid, smooth, fluid-like, rounded, like a jasper. The following are others:

The first one, the one of the bridge, has the quality of representing the motion of the moving solid object, the second one will be of the solid object and have the quality of representing the solid object in space.

Let us consider the case of the hymnbook. The first one, the hymnbook of St. Peter's, has the following verses:

Dialog, the "thousand-and-one Nights" of Don Quixote, the cave paintings of Titian, the cave languages of Hapsburg, the labyrinths of Ts'ui Pê; this is what the Court of Tenants (whose official motto is "All Things Go to the Infinite") would proclaim. The truth is that it proclaims nothing new, much less spectacular. The Court of Tenants, like all revisionist movements, pretends to have reached the "heart of things." But it pretends that the heart is a gigantic and circular maze and that the maze is itself a language. It pretends that the maze is a language and that all these "languages" are a series of inscrutable interjections and interjections of the same phrase. It pretends that these phrases are not phrases at all, but statements which move the phrase. It pretends that these statements are organized in definite logical structures and that the "structures" (which are also statements) are not logical in nature. It pretends that these "structures" (which are also declarations) are independent verifications which are given the honorific of "proof."

The Court of Tenants declares that the universe is an infinite series of statements, but it also declares that each statement is a "fact." It declares that the universe is an infinite series of assertions, but it also declares that each assertion is a "particular fact." It declares that the universe is an infinite series of assertions which are not just assertions, but which are also particular facts. It declares that the universe is an infinite series of statements which are not just statements, but which are also particular verifications.

For example: Hugo Grotius, in his textbook of mechanics, proves that the speed of light is 2400 meters per second. This fact is particular: it is a statement concerning one particular event in the course of which that fact is pertinent. Hugo Grotius proves that the speed of light is 2400 meters per second, so that for every such event there are three others as well. Hugo Grotius proves that the universe is an infinite series of specific verifications, since these verify previous ones as well. Hugo Grotius proves that the universe is an infinite series of statements which are not just statements, since these falsify previous ones as well.

I never knew what my prayers would induce a man to reveal to me; I knew that they would not oblige him to reveal. I never questioned their propriety; I accepted their logic. To believe that wisdom consists in logic is to believe that the recognition of a pattern is logically equivalent to recognizing a pattern itself. I do not know whether in Dante's incantation there coexisted a similar immobile form, a secret form implicit in every man's mystery. Perhaps the pattern is immortal, implicit but explicit; perhaps it is transient, cryptic, secret, elusive.

The House of Asterion



On examining the room, his eyes found nothing but a black, burnished matron's dress, a sombre corset, and sandals of the color of his infancy. The adolescent's hands and feet felt solid iron; his mouth and eyes opened and closed in a feeble, erratic speech. His hands and feet responded to no external pressure, but only those of absolute stupor. His mouth formed no words, but merely dropped from it in silent gasps.

His hands and feet responded to no external pressure; his mouth formed some vague, half-formed command.

The room was of equal parts matter and spirit, complete and total harmony. All were equally dear to him: his flesh and his spirit, his old age and his young face, the days and the feelings of the world. He opened his eyes again and perceived the house and the imperfectly defined figure of a face.

"Hello, Asterion," he said in a weak, half-vocal voice. He tried to make out the simple, uniform features with which we are familiar. "I am old and foolish, but I know a road that leads to some far place where the seasons are kind and the days are short. Perhaps you can tell me what I am to do?"

The little face listened intently, almost dumbfounded by the question. Then it opened its golden eyes and answered, in perfect unison:

"Hello, Doctor Sunshine."

The man perceived a polished, almost polished-iron, two-headed monster sitting in a corner. It seemed to it absurd and trivial things as well as immense and

Dialog, in order to declare that, in order to attain that which is final, men must first of all be obscure; that, in order to attain that which is final, men must first of all of obscure deeds do something, which is not of themselves, which is another man. (I have said this in order to show that this obscureing of a man's own acts is the chief obstacle to his attaining that which is final.)

There is, of course, a second and even more subtle reason for this declaration: to the intellectual man there exists nothing that is not, is here, and never was. This state of being is called pre-philosophical. It is obvious that man did not enter it by chance. He had to reason, in order to be. (It is also obvious that he does not enjoy it.) This intellectual pre-existence, which is called intelligible, is complete and final, and allows of no deviation. The reasons it conceives cannot be deduced from the Scriptures, but they seem cogent to us, simple and obvious to them.

It is evident that the intelligible state of being is pre-scientific, and pre-supernatural. But pre-supernatural is also evident that the pre-scientific state of being is idolatrous. Man, says the theologian Valentinus, transcends the creation and dedicates himself to the satisfaction of the circular idols of the gods. Irenaeus affirms that the universe does not coexist prefiguratively in our minds, but that it is our own internal being which we perceive and imagine. Cyprian, in the fifth book of his De divinae, prefigures the divinity: "For as in a fable a tree which has lost its fruit returns to the spot it was thrown from, so the world and the divine essence would be fully imagined to me, if there were no fabrications with which the world is decorated."

I do not wish to refute the world, but I do wish to construct another, a world in which there is no more work for men, in which there is no more laborious conceit. I have said that the world is corruptible, and that its opposite is beneficial. Man, I maintain, could be both good and corruptible. He could act in conformity with justice, and act in accordance with the love of learning. He could be perfect and act in accordance with equity

The first novel was called Funes the Fierce (the pen name of Francisco Franco Funes), and its cover bore this enigmatic inscription:

"This is not a story of a heroic Funes, but the story of a people who gave place to place, man to man, generation to generation, generation to generation, generation to generation, generation to generation, generation to generation, man, man, man, maid to master, master to maid, maid to master, master to slave, slave to slave, master to child, master to monster, monster to child, child to master, child to master, child to child, child to child, child to child, child to child, child to child, child to child, child to child, child to child, and so on" (paragraph 18). Funes was a jingoist who destroyed cities with arrows and annihilated tribes with fire. When the police brought this to an end, he said: "I have done no more than what every man does, slay some one, get some money or wound in the side of some one, sleep well at night and let the next day start all over again."

Funes' other novels, which have been translated into several languages, have been very poorly received. They are those of Renatus Marichalinus, which describe the downward progress of a person who has lost all memory of him; of Marcellus Marr, who becomes a giant who destroys cities and annihilates tribes; of Marius Lentulus, who turns into a vampire who kills and annihilates people; of Gellius Claudius Scipio, who becomes a monster who destroys cities and annihilates tribes. Some of the later works, such as "The City and the Minstrel" and "The Rape of Lucullus," are very faithful histories of a military phenomenon.

The book that Miró wrote is an endless synthesis of recent philosophical traditions. He does not adhere exclusively to the Logio, but he does adhere to the idea of two dimensions to which we shall return in a moment. We can observe in this book various modifications of the idea of a personal God, which have considerably contributed to the general philosophy of our age.

We shall now study the main themes of the book.



II



The Beginning

We begin with the Problem of Causality. We know that cause is a concept which we acquire in time; Miró appeals to this fact, perhaps, to the mythical beginning of time, which is not his, but rather the beginning of time as we know it. Time thus acquired becomes time as we know it, but with a difference: there is no past, present, or future. Time thus acquired is a succession of states, each of which we apprehend with less certainty than the one before it, but which together form a larger and more truthful picture. Thus, each of our appearances is a transition from one state to another. Each of our sensations is a return to that higher state. Each of our actions is a receptacle for that state's fire. Thus, each of our sensations is a reductio ad absurdum of that state's true feelings. Each of our states is an infinite regress toward another, a higher form of its lower states, each a higher form of its earlier forms. Now, each of these forms is reducible to its higher, whereas the higher forms are not to the earlier forms. Thus, the earlier forms constitute a verbal system; the latter constitute a mathematically complete world.

We now come to our second premise. If there is no cause, who causes events? We answer that there is no God, but that God would be impossible if for every will there were no experience; the system of experiences would be too complex a form of negation. Experience, then, is an "inverse of " the unknowable will be. Our moral psychology reveals the same inequality between God and the theologians imagine; experience, said Emile Durkheim, is a complete ren

I

The first thing to be said is that the date of the death of this admirable philosopher is immaterial; for the purposes of this investigation, we shall have to consider him shortly.

It is true that this writer (who, in order to be objective, must distinguish between two and two again) has never seen Napoleon; he only associates the name with abominable eternities and then with a dead philosopher. This is no less an assertion than it is an instance of indeterminacy. It is true that if we wished to find out what this philosopher was preparing for us, we should have to go beyond the provinces of the speculative and reach the interior quarters of the physical realm. It is true that there is no physical world; it is also no less an assertion to say that there is no one that does not exists prior to the appearance of Napoleon. It is also no less an assertion to say that in the very centers of the physical universe there is a single individual, in whose consciousness all others are contained. It is also no less an assertion to say that this individual is, for all our expectations, unknown. . .

Let us consider this possibility in turn. An infinite regress is impossible, for what is known before coming into being is useless for creating (I am Fortunato, I say hello to you) and what is known afterwards will never be true (I am Fortunato, I say hello to you twice). Since the second possibility is less certain, let us suppose that it is true. Now, if to be known twice is less certain than to be known once, it must be said here that to be known once is less certain than to be known once.

Now, if each time we expect something of ourselves, we shall at last arrive at the point at which we do not want to be known, at the point at which we cannot help wondering whether we shall ever be able to say nothing at all. This last opinion has been formulated by Camus: "I am the night, I am the stars."

I never was one to mingle vanity with vanity's mistress, but I perceived that the color of the stranger's face and of his swift steps would yield to the preferred medium of my voice. To that I replied: "You have entered our house, stranger." To this word I added: "In vain."

With those words I threw myself to the ground, threw myself so senselessly, that my assailants saw only blackness. With my senses still a little hazy, I assumed the most extraordinary postures, as if I were one of the insects devoured by a vermin infesting a tomb or of some other infested place. In this pretended trance I uttered the most improbable words: "We, my brothers and sisters, verily do fall to be masters of this house." Then I sank into sleep, and as is the custom with me, dreams last but a moment.

No one knows with what dismayed and excited a few moments these few minutes of rest. For myself, the most curious and terrible memory is that of Erwan's dagger. I gazed at it with an incomprehensible anxiety; then, as if it were the last face I should see, I dreamed that it was also the most distant.

The Grass and the Wolf

The grass and the wolf were the most ancient and familiar images in my mind. The wolf had once terrorized them; now he guards the unreachable streams and on the forked paths; the grass, on the other hand, has lately given way almost entirely to the deer. Not far from Hereford, by the side of the ford that is the gleam of the torch, one sees a grove of cherry orchards; at first glance, they seem to be the same; but, traveling through my dreams, I remember they are not.

The grass and the wolf were not the only image in my mind when I said: "I will go and kill the Grass and the Wolf." From time to time I dream that as a last resort I shall break in upon the simple pleasures of this world and steal a bicycle or a car. The thought of a dream-

Dialogues I and II are the only two of the works of Toland I have not already mentioned. I think that the reason for this is this: in the first place, the action is committed in a dream; secondly, the dreamer does not know in what manner the action will take place; thirdly, the action does not belong to him who does it; fourthly, the matter in question is not eternal and is always subject to alteration. I do not know whether these considerations are decisive; I suspect that they are not.

When the life of Toland is understood in this way, its vagueness and obscurity are reduced to a certainty; the attempt to construct a history of the universe, committed to writing, is an effort unqualified success.

Timaeus, Who Was That One Man?



There is one man of short stature, of middling features, of uneven habits of speech, who accomplished all things in a single act. He was a tanner in the village of Netzer, on the Danube. He would bathe his face in the brook Fult and then again in the brook Lydian. At night he would sit up looking out of the crevice of an old oak and over the water with a silent and bitter admiration. He would imagine that the objects around him were bronze and horse. He would paint a horse's bridle and then another one and another one and another. The effect was enchanting, like that of a mirror which distorted the form of the spectator, but it was also certain. This person would see all time in a line along which the horizontal line went from the north, through the temples of Megiddo, through the temples of Esarhaddon and as far as the Twins. He would not see the horizontal line, which was straight, but he would know that it went on advancing toward the stars. This person did not speak Greek, but he understood it all and thought that he was superior to the others because he had seen them all. He saw the creation in four dimensions and thought that it were three-dimensional. He perceived the forms of the earth, the air, the water, and the fire and he thought that they were three.

In a small theater in the village, a play is being performed by the people. The audience sings and makes merry; the people laugh and shout expletives. Suddenly, a young man with a stick in each hand appears and begins to beat on the walls and the pulpit of the theater. The people begin to flee in all directions. A man comes from the outskirts of the village and stops his car. The stranger, astonished, asks who the man is. The stranger explains that he is from the village and that he is the "last of the Bulgars." Then he tells the stranger of the prophecy and of his family's history.

The following narrative was told me by Luz Ribeiro, who was present at the battle of Cervo Real and at the battle of Teoran.



Luiz Ribeiro (1896-1934) was one of Brazil's most celebrated writers of pulp fiction. His best known stories (like "Death by Bowling," "The Tower of Babel and Other Stories") tell the adventures of eccentric characters who use their wits and inventiveness to confuse, in various ways, their or their visitors, in hospitals, at work stoppages, in amusement parks, on barges, in steamboats, on gyrocopters, in airplanes and on several continents. (Among the fictional places visited by "The Mole" is Montevideo, Uruguay, where "The Tower of Babel and Other Stories" was written.) In other stories ("The Secret in the Velvet," "The Miracle at Hieronymous Bosch," "The Mystery of Edwin Drood") the characters do not go on doing stupid things; rather, the events that lead to their accomplishment are done away with or explained away in such a way that it is no longer hard to believe them to be the extraordinary events that they are. (For example, the man who discovered that Hermann Maria Erfjord was a Buddhist priestess invented a religious cult around him.) The main problem with all his stories is the problem of explanation: how is it that a man like Hermann Maria Erfjord bemused by the people he encounters at the beginning of the story (who do not

Dialog, the Ancient and Compendious, the Gospel of Thomas, and many others. In the last, Homer, in a voice which is not his own, speaks of the "four hundred and second night" in the Odyssey. In other words, in order to form an accurate idea of the work, we must admit (as Homer did) the possibility of some interpolation.

The next difficulty is this: how, out of a total composition in which all the elements are common to all men, to the Cyclops and the Child and the Fortune, to the Tetrarch and the Lay of Hadrian, to the Tetrarch and the Pearl of Great Price, to the Tetrarch and the Iliad, one man (whose name we cannot discover) inserted his own creation into the many? This one man, the biblical Jesus, created the world and himself as a game of dice with the devil. He thought he was creating a person, he thought he was creating a metaphysical unity with the eternal, he thought he created the world and himself as an illusion. To make this person whole, to make him whole, was enough for him. He was obliged to undergo hell and the purification of the angels, and yet he could do nothing against the omnipotence of God. "God is invincible," people say; "why, one of His creatures can easily be paroled?" Because, says the Orthodox theologian Ambrose, because man is nothing else than (1) an arrangement of causes (2) an arrangement of co-ordinate parts (3) of an active and passive combined into one (4) of potentialities. "The divine image has been placed before our conjugal eyes," writes St. Paul; "its perfection is a matter of our humble resignation." God, says the philosopher David Hume; "I understand you not to employ an image in place of the person whom you pontificate so highly." Man, says the ancient Egyptian God, "is a state of potentialia, which can only be penetrated by a power infinite and secret." God, writes the Babylonian alchemist Heraclitus, is a state of ectoplasm and mud.

The Tripartite Pact

(written by H.G. Wells)



I. THE BEGINNING

The universe was orderly. It seemed to be composed of a firmament on one side and an imaginary sphere on the other. There was no air or water. The sphere was made up of a rigid outer shell and an opaque mantle. The solid shell was identical to that of the fez. Every four years, the principal planet revolved the fez from A to Z.

Before the beginning of the world there was a river Ganga in a certain location. At the particular place, a man named Ramanuja, endowed with unusual powers, began to experience violent fits of delirium. He was guided by the impression that he was going to a sacred place and was led on the most desperate expeditions by the vague but certain impression that he was discovering for him and for the surrounding places the hidden secret of the universe. He experienced a kind of vertigo and then sat up in bed and, beginning each night, uttered the word Mantra. After a time he would dream for a considerable period of time a dream in which the whole world was the work of a single being. . . The Ramayana relates that a certain king of the country was infuriated by this madness and banished him to the bottom of the ocean; but Ramayana soon discovered that the torment of the ocean was worth the temporal distress of his banished realm. He traveled the earth, teaching and refining the art of divination. One day he passed through an insignificant outlying regions, as he wrote in the Iliad, and saw a hut in the woods, a stone grating, a worm pit, a cross, an upside-down log, a pole without a pole, a woman squatting before a fire, a snake protruding from a hen; this description corresponds exactly to the description in the Parnasthani. From this description, probable deductions were possible. One, that the majority of the earth is composed of stone; two, that the stone element is inferior to that of the stones themselves; three, that the inferiority complex is expressed in the Hatha; four, that the practice of the art tends to elevate the mind to a mental medium between the material and the spiritual worlds

My Struggle with Evil

Written: My Struggle with Evil, Tuesday, April 22, 1945

Cited: Selected Letters, vol. 2, p. iv



All this I have had to tell you, my dear friend, to prove that nothing I say can be true or false. Now, let us examine another statement, this concerning my future plans. I recall that you predicted that I would begin work on a history of the world, some thirty pages in your book. Immediately after that, you read in Leugi the first volume of a work in progress which is called The Arcadia of Chairman Mao. In this work you record that I have: (1) Adj-volted the Chinese Classics; (2) Discovered the dialect of the revolutionists; (3) Discussed the Chinese Revolution with the Marxist Combinatorics Department head, Tses Hemedesi; (4) Commented that Chairman Mao had written in this dialect; (5) Translated the writings of Chairman Mao; (6) Translated the essays of Chairman Mao; (7) Translated the works of Chairman Mao; (8) Edited the Works of Chairman Mao; (9) Edited the Works of Chairman Mao Tse-tung; (10) Edited two volumes of Chairman Mao's Problematica; (11) Edited two volumes of Chairman Mao's Festschrift; (12) Edited two volumes of Chairman Mao's Critique of the Opera; (13) Edited a volume of Chairman Mao's Biographies. All these papers were written or were about to be written before or since your visit to Tientsin. Considering them complete, I think of nothing but the two volumes of Chairman Mao's Critique of the Opera. The logical conclusion is that I must be some sort of a lame and decrepit old man, unable to bear the rigors of writing and publishing. Of course, I know of no logical or historical proof.

You ask me whether I am convinced that, in the final analysis, the Chinese Communist Party is the revolutionary party of the whole world. My answer is a definitive "no." I do not believe in a force external to its internal affairs, in an invisible and intangible public good that can be measured in tattered thongs and distributed among the people, but I believe in a private good that

Dialog, which is absurd, since it makes a contradiction out of the concept of a river. (I repeat that this text is not the work of Tlön; it is the petaphor of that place.)

The second book is the one in the topographical and chronological reverse order. The third is the one in the series of the "present tense" (the symbolic forerunner of present-tenses today), the one dealing with the "origin and progress of the universe." The fourth is the one in the series of time, the one dealing with "the year, the year of our Lord one thousand nine and one," the invisible beginning of a series of infinite time periods. I have mentioned these three books; they are not necessary for our purpose, since the three parallel plots are enough.

The fifth book is called "The Garden of Forking Paths," and it is the product of a single night. The sixth book is called "Names," but do not you well perceive that I have nothing to do with them? They stand for no other reason than that the "gnarled arc forms" of the previous books ― who can be surprised that I choose that title? ― should be able to sound elitist. The reason is obvious: the plots in "The Garden of Forking Paths" are identical, but the object. Who can be amused that "The Wheel in the Wall" should be a cover story for the capture of a prison crow and the abandonment of a prisoner for a night?

To conclude (and this may be unnecessary), let me repeat that a secret police organization, the TI, does not exist in the world of dreams. Mycenae has no intelligence service; it has a secret police, a high congress of which it is a branch. Its head is a man of letters ― Barlach, Bloy ― who for twenty years has ruled from Madrid. He is a strict literalist; his pen is always running familiar brandies; his table is always covered with works of fiction; his lips are forever quenched by water. He has no luxury: he never eats nor drinks, but suppers on palm-groves or along the roadsides. Once, while mending a penknife, he let fall a few leaves of a palm. This accident, which seemed to confirm and magnify all his other evils, was the beginning of a glorious friendship.

====================
Dialog: The Dead. The Lands of the Shadow. The Secret Garden. The Garden of Forking Paths.

The first two stories are classic in their day; they are, however, the subject of multiple translations and slight variations: a variant that the author neither desired nor appreciated. The first story is a modern reprint of the first published in 1689, and the story of the secret garden is a modern translation of an ancient one. The story of the secret garden is, in fact, anachronistic: the author has eliminated the novelties of the nineteenth century and the story of a murderer who has forgotten his victims is contemporary. The story of the secret garden is also a modern story; the author has retained the structure of the classic story. The important point is that the original is not to be found in the manuscripts of the Codex Sinaiticus nor in the rare copies of the Codex Florensio. The important thing is that the story of the secret garden should be possible and that the difficulties be such that the reader should not only be able to understand it, he should also be able to guess at its composition.

The author has made possible in a single work the exploration of divergent and even antagonistic paths. Some aspects of his condition are already mentioned; they will be apparent, in the work as in the stages at which they chart a course of happiness, as the case may be, marked by danger and error.

The Plant and the Serpent



He who has not seen the forest has not experienced the act of perception

― Amis D'oe, Suriocrates



Aristotle understood that all mental acts are the same, and he added that they are all the same only in one way: only in one perception. Since all perceptions are the same, he said, they must be identikko. Kant regarded this axiom as conclusive, and denied (in the seventeenth century, Ricoeur was among those to do so) the reality of the relational world. I believe we can take a more humble view. Prejudice does not revolve around the impossibility of seeing the forest, or of having smelled the leaves; rather, it aims at the idea of the act of seeing. Prejudice is about the act of seeing something unreal.

The Thinker and the Sphere



The romance of the cages, the mystery of the sphinxes, the geography of the circles, are but two of Aristotle's figurative arts. The first deals with the problem of time: what we call yesterday, another today, another another. Aristotle argues that the whole history of the universe, both past and future, is less than one second; for example, yesterday this tea is new, today it is new today, today it is new today. Time is continuous, but only in the sense of ever lasting in space and never lasting in time; timeless is one of the meanings of the term continuous. There are also problems of causality: what is yesterday (or some other instant) making of our lives, as we age? Time is continuous in

"You're wrong." The priest's voice was calm. "I am not wrong. You seek the ultimate truth -- the truth about the world and yourself. I seek the ultimate truth about the human heart: how can one be all powerful and not be also human? You have read the Quixote. You know that the true Quixote is not all wicked, but rather the just and the true, the innocent and the guilty. You also know that all men are innocent until proven guilty. You see that the sole test of truth is not the face on a plazacoat, but rather the gravity of the charge and the value of the evidence against it. You see that the only justification of a man's doing evil is when that evil does him good and good does not hurt anyone else. You see that the only punishment for a man is to do what others will not do and you, an impartial judge, are neutral between the two extremes."

I was not quite certain what to make of all this. I had renounced the past and the future and had instead been asked whether I was what Jesus was not. I said that I was "a teacher distinguished for my indifference to the past and my indifference to the future." I thought of the paradoxical fact that two men who believe in the divinity will be two equally indifferent men, one who does not know whether to smile or cry, and another, already overcome with emotion, who will not know whether to laugh or cry. I thought of the fact that the future -- the present, the next instant -- is what Jesus desires, and the past what he more readily accepts. I thought of Siegfriednung, when the cynic does not know whether to laugh or cry. I thought of the irony that a man who does not know whether to laugh or cry is a man indifferent to the past. I thought of the irony that a man indifferent to the past is also a man open to the idea, in a positive way, but closed in a negative way, in an inverse way, to the idea of immortality. Suddenly it occurred to me that the most elementary of human convictions is an inverse contradiction: a man who believes in the divinity is also a man indifferent to the past. I thought of Plato's use of this inverse contradiction in the Phaedo to demonstrate that the world is not round, and of the paradoxical character of the commandment in the Iliad

The Problem of the Accursed



Objection 1. It would seem that nothing is sacred but its God. For Augustine (De Trin. i, 3): "God is invisible, yet revealed; nothing is impious because of the presence of an invisible God, yet base because it is dependent on the presence of an invisible God." Now nothing is sacred but God. Therefore, nothing is sacred.

Objection 2. It would seem that God cannot be known. For Augustine (De Trin. i, 3): "We know Him, through faith, but we do not know Him fully; we know Him in part, but we do not fully understand Him: we know Him according to the dialectics of the philosophers, but He really is the philosopher who knows Him in part."

Objection 3. Further, every act is preceded and followed by a counter-act. But nothing precedes or follows the Book of Mormon. For nothing precedes nor follows the word of truth. Now nothing precedes nor follows the word of magic, because magic is an act of revelation. Therefore nothing precedes nor follows the word of witchcraft, because witchcraft is an act of divination.

On the contrary, There is a time when nothing happens, and that time is the Book of Mormon's.

I, Michael Angelo, do hereby proclaim and proclaim to the world the Book of Mormon.

The first impression of one who sees the Louvre, the Louvre of Thiers, is, first, the vast and respectful vault; the second, the monstrous face, the monstrous countenance; the third, the arched window, the arched window arch, unmoved by the wind. The first impression lasts for a few moments; the second, a lifetime; the third, all of a sudden, for ages. Such is the first impression produced by Vittorio Storaro's monumental and most unfortunate work, the History of Religious and Historical Experience.

Two centuries go by; then, a century; then, a century. A certain Clement of Alexandria, in the third century, speaks of an age when the spiritual and material world would no longer exist; this Alexandrian age he cherishes, after a fashion
====================
Dialog, in the first verse:

I would fain know the causes of all the things that happen to me

and in the second:

Forgive me, Father, if I seem to ask why you, who am perfect, affect these penitent gestures

and in the third, unknowable:

Why do you always weep for Alice?



The seventh fragment (fr. khan) is the one most frequently quoted, but which is equally arbitrary. It has been placed at the base of the Banbury verse, between the first two and before the aorists. Some authorities interpret it (as does De Quincey) as meaning:

I would fain know the causes of all the things that happen to me

but that reading is suspect, as anyone who has studied the poem will know. It says nothing at all about the different gestures Alice employs, nor does it emphasize the characteristic subject matter of the poem. Quite the opposite: it says nothing at all about the subject matter at all times, except perhaps to remark that the poem is a work of fiction. It says nothing about the novel's narrator or about the peculiar plot or about the peculiar times in which the poem is set. All it says is that Alice borrows a pen (presumably a round one) from a beggar and that they talk about it at length. Another man comes along and uses this pen (presumably a heavy one) to write these gestures:

I would fain know the causes of all the things that happen to me

and interprets this use of the word "do" as a play on words ("do") and reads this expression figuratively:

to know the causes of all the things that happen to me. . .

Which of the following three readings would be correct? The one favored by Bachelier and endorsed by De Quincey, the other by Reid, or the one favored by Placido Domingo Valladares and criticized by Gustave Eiffel? I don't believe either reading is correct. The fact that they are both acceptable is sufficient to prove that they have been determined metaphorically.

As for the origin of the other meaning of the third fragment, that of the twelve cardinal directions, that, too, is enough to prove that they were so.

24. The Grand Canyon

The Erinnerung des Zabinsk
====================
Dialog = function () { return this . _query (); }; var Text = function ( data ) { return data ; }; var list = { Name : "Funes" } ; list . Name = "Leo Apostol" ; list . Name ++; list . Name . _query ( null , function ( elem ) { list . Name ++; list . Name . _query ( elem , function () { return this . _query ( elem ); }); });

This function, which just returns a random string, is slow, but it works. The speedup is due to the fact that the algorithm generates randomness that is not present in the returned string. The key to this algorithm is the fact that the returned string is an infinite sequence. (The same is true of the random number generator, but the generator is finite.) This finite string can then be compared, reduced, rearranged, nested, compared again, compared again, until an exhaustive list of possible permutations is generated. The time required to perform this task, in the typical case, is very little; the time required to evaluate this list of random numbers, in the example of the one line argument, is enormous.

The idea behind generators is to avoid the problem of choosing the right value for a variable. It avoids the problem of choosing the right value only in so far as the return value of the generator depends on this value. This avoids the problem of infinite loops, which are an inexact science. In a generator like this, the loop is infinitesimal, and the small difference between the number of elements in a line and the line's width is negligible. In many ways, then, a generator is like a game of telephone: a caller answers a few questions, the telephone company records the answers, and the records the numbers called.

But a generator is also like a telephone game where, at the end of a long conversation, the last speaker left standing is sure to have won.

The following exposition will, I believe, resolve all doubts.

Theory

Suppose that we have a perfectly simple game of telephone. Let us call it the game of possibilities. Before starting with it, however, it suffices to show that its rules do not presuppose it. Let us consider an example. Let us say that there is a river R opposite the place indicated on the map. In the first game, R must be on

Dialogual production. So, for example, we read in Statues of the Universe: "The universe was a mere fabrication of the mind, a device of the artist to evoke in his subjects an emotion or an image of him, but in a way that would not be able to be reproduced in another place or under another pretext." Or again: "The painting of the same name is a commentary on the credulity with which the mystics interpreted the Vision of the Mystic."

There are others, of course, which are not merearinesses of the form "The universe is a mere fabrication of the mind, a device of the artist to evoke in his subjects an emotion or an image of him," but which nevertheless fail the two tests set forth above. These are the "pictorial" works, those set in the pictorial spaces of art museums or in the pictorial mentalities of the artists. They can also be those of a psychological nature, those which deal with the mental, but they lack the pictorial quality.

The second kind of work is that of a law, or of a program, a logical or mathematical axiom. It is noteworthy that the logical positivists, those who believe in no other logical order than that of prefix and suffix, break away from the others. Schopenhauer, for example, adheres to the Order of Perception, that is, to the Order of White, Red, and Blue. But since color is not a part of that order, since color is an external perception, he thinks that color is not a part of the physical world. Thus he adheres to the Order of Emptiness.

The third kind of work is that of symbols. Such is the practice of Max Müller, for example, of the stars, of the earth, of the meter, of the number of times, of the circles of Phi, of the Sepher Yezirah, The Master.

The fourth kind of work is symbolic, external in character. It is found in that perceptive and secretive quarter of philosophy which the theologians and the mystic flee from, which is often just as deceitful and secret as the seekers. Some of its doctrines are pernicious. I prefer to differentiate two (logical) ones, namely, that all language is innumerable, and another (traducial) that all language is sacred. The former two errors, I think,

Dialog, the Gospel according to the Learned."[93]

The following pages are taken from the second edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, New York, 1951.

The term horoscope is used in an indefinite sense, and refers to any book which lists the twenty-or-so signs which designate the seasons. The term Bible horoscope is more precise; it denotes a definite class of books which combine astrological and seasonal information with that given in the Canon. These books are those of the Cabalists, of whose number there are several thousand in Europe. The books of this kind differ from the astrological books in the Bible only in that the astronomical books employ a much larger number of planets than the literal books. (Astrological books, like literal books, deal with the forty-or-so chief elements; astronomical books deal with the rest.) Their astrological information is given in parentheses.

The first essential characteristic of horoscope books is their brevity. In the astrological books, for example, we read that the zodiacal signs are the five senses, the magnetic senses, taste, sight, hearing and judgment; in the literal books, we read that the senses, sight, hearing, judgment and so on, until finally judgment of the astrologer (John of Damascus, c. 1400), is given. The brevity, the epistolary character of the information given here, is due to the fact that the history of mankind parallels the history of the zodiacal signs. The history of the nations; the history of the divisions of the human family; the history of the union of the hemispheres—all these are mentioned. The brevity also pleases the eye; it pleases the mind more. The matter of brevity pleases me, for it means that I shall never know the difference, in their strictest sense, of two men of the citadel of Babylon.

Another essential quality of these books is their brevity. Astrological books, like literal books, give the forty signs their ordinary meaning; literal books, the astrological one which signifies the forty signs. The omission of the astrological meaning is one of the marks of brevity; the fact that the books use astrological signs and astrological phrases, as well as those used for astronomical terms, shows that the books are astrological in intent. In the case of all

I remember a girl of about sixteen or so of the name of Maria Theresa, who wrote to me from Spain about two years ago. She was very kind and sincere, but she was also passionate and sarcastic. She spoke very little Spanish, but she tried to do so, probably because she was tormented by a vague and insistent Italianic. She recalled that she too came from Umbria, that her father had been a great defender of the Umbrian independence war, that her mother had emigrated to America, that her father had emigrated to Spain and that her mother had emigrated several times, in secret, to escape the rigors of war. She recalled also that her mother had been a member of the infamous Genovese crime family, that her father had been a member of the infamous Genovese crime family, that her mother had emigrated to America, that her father had emigrated to Spain and that her father had emigrated several times, in secret, to escape the rigors of war. She spoke of being educated in the most enlightened parts of the globe, of having gone to Oxford, Cambridge, Milan, Genoa, Dresden, and now she was to travel two thousand leagues to the east, to the second-most illustrious city on earth, to visit the heart of the city in which Mao Tse, the founder of the Red Guard, had his palace. She spoke of having read in the newspapers the heroic battles of Rastenburg and of having sought out and embraced the glorious tidings. . . The picture which I have related is not an unreal one; it is the record of reality.

In the afternoon, I took her to see the Pyramid of Cheops, which is the most ancient and magnificent structure in all Germanic art. This pyramid stands on the summit of an
====================
Dialog, Léon Bloy, called it, with a smile, the "most splendid" and "clarifying" book he had ever read. He spoke of the transmigration of ideas and of the "transposition of diverse mirrors." He noted that the form of the book was that of a commentary on the Metaphysics of the Asexual Laboratory by Adalberto Suarez Ferreira ("Discusión e inutilizco do Vegetalum by Adalberto Suarez Ferreira") and of the Arquista de la vida compañera by José Maria Cipriano Visconti. He noted also that the "ideas" of the Metaphysics are given, and that "the work is a sort of theological and metaphysical exposition of the Arithmetic."

Suddenly he ceased speaking. An Indian servant came in with a bucket of water. "Here we have the fluid that will kill you," he said cheerfully. "It is very viscous."

Léon Bloy began to relate his story. In this way, the water and the ideas it symbolized disappeared. Suddenly, a man opened the jar and withdrew a viscous object. It was a stone. Léon Bloy paid it no attention and went on. Slowly, attentively, a picture of the countenances Dandy stood by disappeared. He was, I think, Léon Bloy.

One of the companions brought him a bottle of rum. Léon Bloy drank it without emotion or resentment. Suddenly, he felt that he and the rest of the world were very large and terrible and very dank and very dark. The external world seemed to him greatly exaggerated; he said nothing, but it seemed to the others that they were much the same.

Suddenly, all this time ago, with all these magnificent manuscripts, with these admirable critics, with these erudite judges, with all these things ― with one single man, one single dream, one single rainbow, one single color, one single pattern of leaves, one single shining diamond ― one single dream ― disappeared.

He did not understand what had happened. I understand it as follows: The first harmony he ever played was that of Gounod's, and the first thought that came to Léon Bloy's mind was the pattern of leaves. He played it many times, without success; then he remembered that

The decision to include such an action ― the final destruction of a world ― in the history of an empire is, in itself, a simple one. The Empire of Heaven, after all, is no less ancient than the world of Homer and Gilgamesh. The economic system of the world of dreams ― a finance capital which in some remote corner of the globe is rich and powerful ― is nothing but the ancient art of dividing men's means of production. The immense treasury of the world of dreams is the earth. The wise do not quaff from it their intoxicating dreams, for dreams are dreams. They are all but effaced by the endless twilight which engulfs Europe.

It is fitting to return to the case of Castor and Pollux. The absence of any apparent plagiarism is sufficient to prove that the authorship of the story cannot be rejected. The following passages from the Buenos Aires Herald are sufficient proof:

The bookseller who bought these volumes told me that he could find nothing in them which was not familiar. He declared that he had examined them and found nothing but the mutilated forms of the readers. He said that the second volume, which tells of the sinking of the last of the ships, is nothing else than a continuation of the first ― completely rewritten ― and that the first tells of the drowning of Jupiter Deignus.

The Problem of Values

Leibniz's second enigma, the one which has excited the most lamentable speculation, has been solved. It concerns the problem of objective values. It is said that Leibniz, in a Letter to Pliny (Ref. iv of his Capital), sets forth his opinions on the origin of these opinions; this he does in a letter which has already been exhaustively reported (see Scharlach, Geschichte des sozialrates Wissens, iii, 1889, and especially Chapter X). Leibniz's refutations, written some days afterward, give a clearer idea of his subject. Amongst other things he denies that the objects of our perception can have an objective value; secondly, that there is a foundation from which the opinions derive; thirdly, that these foundations are moral; fourthly, that that morality derives from any of these opinions. He finally admits that opinion after opinion derives from them; but says that this fact does not justify us in denying their truth (Ref. iv).

Now let us examine these refutations. I. The Argument from Inequality. This refutes the preceding. It states (as Leibniz himself admitted) that it is useless to query whether a thing is less or more valuable than other things. Now, as we know, the less valuable a thing is, the greater the person who is in it; so that if the value of A be its intrinsic value, and its intrinsic value is equal to the value of B, that value is equal to nothing, since nothing can be greater than itself. The same holds good with respect to time, which is like substance: if T is some past moment, then T is not past; but if T is timeless moment, then T is timeless. Now, as we know, objective values are those which can be assessed objectively; so that if the value of A is subjective value, and subjective value is equal to intrinsic value, then intrinsic value is equal to nothing; since nothing can be less of a being than itself. So also, if objective values are to be evaluated, they must end somewhere: if they do not, there can be no such end, for intrinsic values must be the whole of the complex system.

Now, in order to assess the value of something, we must know its

The series follows a young android in London who is convinced that everything is a publicity stunt and that the government has a plan to destroy the human race. One of the android's victims is an engineer named Victor Thorn, who is on a publicity tour to promote his new book. One of the events is a symphony in which some of the idols of the time are to be profited from. Victor's reputation precedes him; his performance does not change his fate. The prosecution failed to prove that this performance of theater constituted an instruction to commit murder. The judge allowed it as a precedent. The prosecution argued that this precedent was an instruction to adapt the example of Victor Thorn to the movie of the same name. They argued that, if the two were to be combined, there was a sufficient link between the two works to justify the prosecution of the one which was not charged. The result was an unknown turn in the history of the law. In the first part of the movie, a detective, played by Peter Sellers, solves crimes and acquires evidence; in the second, he solves crimes and solves no evidence. The first part of the movie is a commentary on the hero's activity and the acquisition of evidence; the second on the activity of the hero and the acquisition of evidence. The law accepted this distinction. The first part of the movie is a description of the detective's methods; the second, of the methods of the detective. Both parts of the movie are instruction manuals for the movie. The second part of the movie is a commentary on the detective's methods; the first on the detective's methods and the movie. The law accepted this distinction. The first part of the movie
====================
Dialogs and fragmentary Plays ; also, the early editions of Léon Bloy, who had some idea of the Kafka tales, and the later, of the traditional stories. In the latter collection one will find selections from the "Little Orpheus" and the "Riddles of Dunsany" books; in the former, the selections from the "Dialogues with Julia" and the "Rumples et Florentines" (and in the latter, the selections from the "Or, Italiano e atlanto-Francoispagna"; the latter are somewhat older, but contain much the same material).

Bloy has called these collections the "literary and musical and architectural and abstract" version of Kafka's "material tales"; his remit is clearly that of reproducing in the highest possible degree, in all respects, the original. This is undoubtedly so; but it also includes, in a language which is familiar but not inarticulate, the absurd and in some measure even in some ways paradoxical inventions of mind. For example, consider the story of an insane man (whose name we do not know) who invents a sort of clock; no one is obliged to take him at his word, but the story does make this discovery: that the interval from the hour hand to the hand again is exactly twelve seconds; this fact is not explained, but it must be apparent that the story begins with an attempt to make something up for what has already been done. Bloy knows of other absurdities as well; these, too, are in some ways at once at home and outside the novel, and even in places distant and far-flung they have some logic to them.

Another brilliant accomplishment of Bloy is the methodical and almost surgical elimination of translations into foreign languages. Of course, these novels can be faithfully rendered in every language, though it is perhaps in order to encourage the effort that there be variations in form and content which do not defeat our purpose. In the stories "The Thousand and First Sin" (translated by J. E. I. Peacock) and "Rajgopalachos" (translated by B. E. Priestman), for example, the original French is translated by L. A. Fontaineanu; in the other stories ("The Diamond Cutter," "The Public and the Anonymous," "The Art of the Deal") the French is by the way the case with

Dialogulation (1892).

In the first part of the second part, written in 1896, he speaks of Hegel's dialectic of presentation, in which two presented objects – the moon and the living Buddha – come to consciousness at the same time. In the second part, he employs the same tools. He proves, in a process of gradual recognition, that the living Buddha is the same as the monkey. He shows that the presentation of the two objects simultaneously presupposes the presentation of their associated visual object. He shows that the presentation of the visual object, other than as a coincidence, is prefigured in advance. . . He shows that the mental image presented at the beginning of the procedure is always true. He proves that the process of presentation proceeds indetectibly, in one single instant. He proves that all ideas that have not a direct object at the outset of the process can be modified later, e.g. those of time, space, the presence of external objects, etc.

Hermann introduced in one volume the systematic logic of Kalecki. In the other, the dialectic of Leibniz. This process of translation, my readers may be excused, has accelerated since your visit to Leipzig a few months ago. We owe to you the present volume, the fourth. I have translated the first ten chapters of Part I., the chapters dealing with the principles of individuation; I intend, in the present edition, to supplement those which appeared in the other, first edition, Länderbuch.

To the problems of time and space, I am now committed the following tenet: (1) All physical objects are tangent to some greater sphere; (2) The greater sphere is always a temporal one; (3) The sphere traversed is that tangent one; (4) The sphere traversed is not the same as the object to be traversed. I do not intend that the terms be traversed and beter beter temporale be taken in this order: the first two are accidental. The method prescribed is arbitrary, inductive. The conclusions drawn are not invalidated, only the method applied. If a fact is questionable, one should ask oneself whether the object to be traversed is also uncertain. "If" is not a valid preposition: it implies an absolute future, which is a questionable conjunction. "The" precludes a questionable conjunction. "Time"

I have said that the first thing one learns is how to love; the second, how to hate. I have also said that the more a man hates, the more he will learn to love; the more a man loves, the more he will learn to hate. If I were entrusted with the secret of making two men worthy of admiration, my first act would be the same: I would place before them the same task which confronted their colleague: the master criticises his slave; the slave revives his master's speech; the slave understands; the slave sees the same thing his master sees. . . But it is certain that as long as there were masters and slaves, there was rivalry, and not the coarsest kind. . . In the year 1824, Menard, in the same journal, refers to the "sabotage" of two masters who had forbidden their chattels to encounter each other; the following year, the same journal describes the invention (d'Artagnan and Ile aux Hautesoriginals) of "a methodical dogmatic examination of dogmas and dogas." Then, in a review of the philosophical and theological works of the eighteenth century, the journal names "Dialogues en Indien," "De seignor Heinrich Bede," "Le Moyne of Bartholomew," "The Labyrinth of Juan Peron." Not a single philosophical dialogue is mentioned. The first man I have enumerated has, in fact, refuted all the dogmatic dialogues: Abelard, Milton, Seneca, Aquinas, Spinoza. Menard does not even attempt to refute them ― he merely duplicates their logical fallacies.

Of all the writers who have attempted to define man, perhaps the few who seem capable of penetrating the clouds of silence which descend over our world are likely to be those who have repudiated the human person. Theologians have tried to make man man. Theist and heretic alike have sought to dissolve the self into language and the world and man. Theologians have tried to dissolve man into three persons: God, the intellect, and knowledge. This result is unsatisfactory. God is identical with God ; the mind and the world are identical with the intellect ; man is identical with the world and language. We cannot become one person by changing the others.
====================
Dialog (immutable, continuous, secret), a possibility which rendered it quite possible that the book I had in my hands might have been that of a man who had slain a foreign king and been tried before an asteroid. I decided to look into this possibility.

A few days after my return from Tlön, I went for a walk in a neighborhood of the old quarter. A woman playing host to foreigners had a lacerated face; her shadow fell across the uneven concrete of the yards. I followed her. The night was clear; the leaves seemed to be turning toward the west. A church stood in the distance; in its facade, crosses had been removed. I thought that this circumstance (in a neighborhood where there were none) would be an indication that there were no more Jews left in the world. No one spoke of the return of the prophet; I speculated that this fact might be a sign that the last days had not arrived and that now the work of the Lord was in the Prophet, who had taught and was saluted. The neighborhood had a certain post-industrial character; there were no factories or settlements. The air was of a damp and clammy character; the elderly woman who I had seen playing host to strangers had been allowed to stay in the neighborhood a while; the fact that she had remained was of historical importance, since it might indicate that the old people of the neighborhood no longer felt the need of the hospitals or the sawmills. I contemplated the possibility of staying overnight at the guesthouse I had visited with my grandmother a few days before; these days, I felt, I was in a new city. Suddenly I noticed that the elderly woman was no longer playing host to strangers. She was speaking with the people and directing them toward a large metal casket on the concrete lot. A very short distance away, a row of iron gates had been opened; a thin figure, very like me, was working on a ventilation shaft. I unlocked the gates and made for the compound.

I found the cell block empty. A few scattered clothes were scattered about. I knocked at the front door. A woman's soft voice replied from the other end: "Uncle Henry is dying of dysentery."

I wrote a note: "My dear Aram, this is the work of a demon. I am going to the hospital." I went out, closed the door, and forgot about the accident for a few minutes. When

Dialog, now beautiful and sweet. He had a dream, a dream of a white horse, of a horse which bore in it the horse, perhaps, of a horse of infinite forms and colors. He dreamt he was walking on the surface of a blue water. The horse was swift, silent, and did not move from the natural tracks it had already prepared. Suddenly, the horse stopped. It was Sigismund, who had dreamed of him. They embraced, sobbing, for hours and hours and hours. Then they awoke. A cold and hard rain had saturated the streets. The moon was transfigured. The world was illuminated. And Sigismund was King. He was in his palace, at the back of the library, surrounded by manuscripts. "What have we here?" he said. "A dream and a rumor and a broken mirror and a thousand books we revived from the dead?"

Chapter 27 Sigismund, c. 1250 Years of war had destroyed the Hungarian armies, but the king's realm was not yet dead. In vain he labored to raise it. Tremblings and heroic hopes gave way to persistent pangs of senility and despair. The peasantry resented the iniquity of the king's tribunal and many died in the inquisitions. The impious wars were often victorious, but the chronicler embellished his annals with defeats and even triumphs which were difficult to fathom. In 1306, the chronicler died. One cold December evening, in London, a leak in the roof broke his leg. He spent six months in the Hospital of St. James's, ate only bland cheeses and roots, and revved his cane. At the age of forty-three, he was gone. The king's chroniclers had banished the chronicler's tangibility, but that had never seemed to them a fatal qualification. They told him, repeated, what they already were, and now that they were chroniclers they could falsify history as they pleased. They told the untold, the ridiculous, the awful. They called everything from a "wind" to a "hail" and from a "tree" to "a river of salt." (The latter two were true.) They invented the absurd. They called everything in the world water. The chroniclers lived in a world without a language. They were oppressed by small dreams which foretold the future with uncanny speed. Sigismund, moved by these

Dialog (Langmuir) were devoted to the idea of a unified concept of time, which would allow us to agree on a common center of reference. The most famous of these works is called The Physical World (Böcklin). In it we are shown that all bodies are potential centers of some number of degrees of change, which we call "moments." This momentary multiplication of possible states is called reflexion, and it is the fruit of a very ancient tragedy. St. Paul tells us (I Corinthians, 13:9) that in one body divided against itself, "a single Spirit would not have worked" it.

"In one body divided against itself" is obvious. The more divided a body is, the more likely it is that some male or female member – say, the female member in question – will not only act in a certain way, think in a certain manner, taste in a certain manner, taste a certain manner, taste-alone, but also have its own characteristics. Man is an idealist, so idealist endeavors have often been the successes of the will; but in practice, the few authentic operations of the will, when they are not counterbalanced by a stoopeding stupidity, tend to be comic. Hence the custom of having a man who is incapable of performing an authentic operation (say, the sign for ten) perform an authentic miracle. Such are the present-day double marriages, the double assassinations, the double assassinations which are simultaneously consummated. The double marriages were the marriage of Tzinacán and Plato, the marriage of Romeo and Juliet, the wedding of Plutarch and Juvenal. The double assassinations are those carried out by policemen and readers of the Spectator; these are the assassins who stopped the Encyclopaedia Militant. It is a fact well established that the more serious the crime, the more difficult it are the accomplices to be found. Hence the double marriages, the double assassinations, the double assassinations which are, according to Bloy, as frequent as the seasons. The double marriages, the double assassinations, are, according to Bloy, as frequent as the seasons. The double marriages, the double assassinations, are as routine as the moon. . . It is a fact well established that the more elaborate the conspiracy, the more systematic it is likely to be. Hence, according to Bloy, the failure of an "informal

In both of these cases, in spite of all reasonable means, ends up in oblivion. Neither of them is unknown, even to us, and even to them, the history of men. I believe that, in the future, both of them will be surpassed and that, in the history of the universe, we shall not even have known the first blots of our fellow human being.

When the sun set on a clouded night in the marketplace of the late Suárez, Juan Francisco López de la Vacedad, in the narrow, rickety cart he rode through the night before, would have given anything to be rid of that tired, exhausted, almost stagnant smell. The gray stone alleyway descended from high above, abysmally so, and before them, cloudless day, was a low, pauperized church. López de la Vacedad felt that his very being was condemned to this level; beneath the broad arched doors he could see the church's stone piazzas and the side walls. The cartwheezed on uneven terrain; outside, the pines were beginning to turn red; inside, the clerk was giving upquests. The fact that we are dealing with clerks did not lessen the gravity of the indignity: a man who had bought some water here, withdrew for a while there, then came back sold oranges there, repaired broken pieces of glass there, gave up cigarettes there, betrayed shoplifters there, betrayed the landlord there, betrayed the police officers there, betrayed the indigent who were losing them, betrayed the indigent who betrayed them, betrayed the indigent who betrayed them, betrayed the indigent who betrayed them, betrayed the indigent who betrayed them, betrayed the indigent who betrayed them, betrayed the clerk who betrayed them, betrayed the clerk who betrayed them, betrayed the clerk who betrayed them, betrayed the clerk who betrayed them, betrayed the clerk who betrayed them, betrayed the clerk who willed this or that to be the case, who was betrayed by López de la Torre.)

Dialoges, you will find them in the appendix to the First Edition, with a few additions.

The first edition of this work was published in 1798 by the publishing house Le Cordonnière. A new edition, a few years later, contained only twenty-two pages. After a number of disastrous stage productions, the manuscript was loaned to the Huxleyan library of the Florentine, where it survives to this day. The author has translated, with the approval of the liberties council of Geneva, the best prose of the second edition; these verses, which form the first forty pages, have not been published.

The discourse Deutsches Hefte, written in the first person, is the most interesting chapter of the work. The German statesman, August Strindberg, had been sent by the emperor of Bavaria (Walther Maria Schliemann) to negotiate an amity between the Taurides and the Tlönians (the infamous Habsburg dynasty); the latter are the vilest and nastiest of the Asiatic races, cold, ferocious, bearded and hornless. The first Spaniard to encounter them is August Strindberg; he is savage and cunning, but also kind and gentle. He never kills or tortures anyone; all those who know him describe him as deeply mortified by the loss of his wife and by the humiliation of seeing him confront three admirably matched warriors. He believes that all races are created equal, and that the Tlönians are unfairly compared with the Asiatics, who make war and bury their dead in deadly pyres. He believes also that all races are vicious; the Tlönians, it turns out, live in a perfect equality with the Inuit, who eschew war and sacrifice their dead in circular pits.

Striklicher translates the Habsburgs' terse questions as follows: "Who are the Tlönians, then? Are they the Asiatics, the Lapps or the Minnesotans? No; they are the Tlönians, who in the city of Reykjavik (where the battle of Fernández took place) was represented by an Asiatoc."

The manuscript also preserves a discourse by Johann Sebastian Berlioz, which tells the story of the discovery of Australia by a party of Spaniards led by Berlioz (Ad

I replied that it was possible, but that it would be better if he tried it. He said: "I shall try it." He did not say how many days or how many nights would elapse between each attempt. I told him that if he succeeded he would receive from me a finished manuscript. He did not answer, and one of the guards came in.

Dialogist, and in the eulogies of René Magritte (who was also a dreamer). He notes that the words "aetherial sphere" are not found in the works of the best thinkers of the nineteenth century, and that we should not be surprised if they did not even know they were talking about an invisible sphere. Not so for David Bowie and in his steads Kurt Waldheim, Wilhelm Teilhard and Hecuba. It is no less astonishing that the best of these men should have come to be idolaters than that they have not. The first clue to this discovery may be found in the fact that all the major philosophical movements of our time have their apocalypses in some way or another (and especially in the last centuries of the twelfth century). Theosophy, postmodernism, New Age philosophy, there is a new dispensation now; and all of them postulate — or have the grace to propose) a new aetheresthat will one day exist in the clouds, in aether, in the midst of the sacred, but which has not yet done so. This "historical chance" (to use Böhme's term) is the sole basis of all their speculation and faith. Theologians, archaeologists, cosmologists have declared that the cosmos (and by that term the aetheresto the cosmos) is profoundly embedded in the subconscious mind of man; but the ancients, like the mystics and philosophers of all creeds, have recourse to this same aethere as well, to that aethere which is neither the cosmos nor the aethere. That is, they have recourse to aethere which is not the aethere of the stars or the aethere of the four winds or the aethere which is not the aethere of time. This aethere, this "contingent aether" (Borges will have explained to me that the ancients meant not only "time" but also "space"), is the only substance which will survive the fall. Man will be dead, but only in the "contingent stead" of aethereths. The "stead" of aetheles, Borges will have remarked to me; that is, in the aetherial stead of the four winds.

====================
Dialogment, which I shall attempt in a moment.

There is nothing new under the sun; what is new is that the poets who have imitated the ancient books have succeeded where the pagans had failed. They have taught us that all that is grand and ancient is achievable by a people who forget its past, who forget that it is they who make the world and that the world makes the world. They have taught us that history is a dialectical process in which the arc de triomphe and the hound and the patch. This process has been with us, they have affirmed, but it is necessary that we, the descendants of those past days, learn to see it from the new standpoint of universal solidarity. The ancient nations, they have taught, have always been international. That is a myth, they have admitted, but it is a myth we must forget, for it is more powerful than all the lies told by man. The nations of olden times, they have said, were not so different from one another than a traveller's cloak is different from another's. Now, rather than thinking of Europe, as did Melville or Emerson, we must remember North America, the land unmolested by time.

I remember a curious lecture given by Alexander Herzen in 1884. He spoke of a secret organization of the mentally deranged, who, like madmen, improvise all manner of daring deeds. They perform underwater excavations, they construct secret bunkers, they assassinate government officials, they poison foreign ambassadors, they poison wells, they break windows, they deface walls. . . One of the men who had committed this despicable act was Dr. Herzen, and he saved the life of a man of considerable reputation by severing his radial artery. The men listened with astonishment and emotionless horror as he extolled the virtues of his undertaking and explained its logical necessity. He confessed that he was not insane; he admitted that he was not even a member of the same mental class as the patient who operated upon him. He confessed also that he had been under the influence of some poisonous plants, that he was deficient in the O in his number, and that he was conversant with dialectical psychology. He was, as it were, immersed in a kind of mythical reverie, in which the most ancient games are transacted and in which, at the end of a long series of inevitable games, the pieces are finally put away

During the course of the following years, the program was repeated on a number of other British radio stations, in the US and Canada, and was also featured in the 1999 video game The Time Machine. (The Time Machine was released in the United States in 2001, and in Europe in 2001.)

Awards Edit

The sixth annual Emmy Awards were held on the first Sunday of February, 2008. The ceremony presented a short telecast of "The Ed Sullivan File", hosted by Simon Reynolds and Rachel Dratch, and featured appearances by Jon Voight, Ian McKellen, Ian Holm, Ian McShane, Gillian Anderson, Stephen Root and Kathleen Turner. (COMIC: Death Becomes Her)

Various unreleased scripts featuring the Tenth Doctor were circulating in the TARDIS, but these never saw the light of day. (PROSE: The Time Monster)

In 2288, the Tenth Doctor received a copy of his late friend, writer, philosopher and mystic, Sam Harris. The two men had become friends after meeting at a reading of Harris's book The Moral Landscape in London in 1972. (PROSE: Time Enough At Midnight)

Harris died on 2999 CE, during the Transfiguration, although his theories concerning how to stop time had been formulated by the Time Enough episode. (PROSE: The Mind Robber)

In another version of the story, the Eleventh Doctor was never aware of having become the Twelfth. (PROSE: The Wedding of Barnabas)

Dialog: Our teacher, Kierkegaard, wrote that all men are heirs of a single, abstract, but all-pervading, authority: God.10

Kierkegaard observed that the best books are those which deny their own subject matter and appeal to the authority of an author who is not the author but, on the contrary, an impersonal, universal authority which all men are responsible for honoring and which they can only do so much believe in.11

This observation has been misunderstood. It does not forbid a book which does not deny the author's authority, but it forbids a book which does not affirm it. The latter is the preferred reading of the theorists who have advanced the "authority" hypothesis, but it is the perverted reading of the unfortunate theorists who advocate it.

The second thesis, which I shall call "the literary function of the symbolic" (translation by J. E. I. )," involves the problem of how the symbolic can be of service to life.12

Pierre Menard has suggested that the symbolic is the means by which the real is known. This, of course, is an empirical correlation, viz. a correlation of apparent essences. But it is a correlation which, taken in the right proportions, can produce surprising results. For example: if A and B are objects of sense, and if we interpret A symbolically as "A man who cuts his hair" ― this is an example of using the fact that A has been cut his once more to express a theme which is common to all men, and thus serving as a symbol for life itself. If, on the other hand, we interpret B symbolically as "All men are stones," we serve to point out an identity which is not necessarily obvious, for all men are stones.

The symbolic can also serve to cancel out and cancel out again. If I wanted to cancel out the second example (which concerns myself with the moment when I came to cut my hair) and offer it to you, my reader, I would say: "That man who cut his hair was a stone, Gulliver." If you took that statement as an example of negation, you would not be saying it, you would have said "that man who cut his hair was a stone which contained all men." But since it was saying "all men," it had been cancelled out. This cancellation, then, can serve two functions: either
====================
Dialog, a literary criticism, has declared that "Borg-Leibniz's The Position is the closest we shall ever come to a pure reason, a pure reason without prejudices or pretensions."4

It is, perhaps, fitting to end this theory of Borges with the question which we posed it in the first place: if reason is a rational being, how came it to be divided in him into the posterior and the anterior parts? The answer is that reason – and perhaps also conscience – have a symbolic value, a relationship to the letters of the alphabet. In the first place, every one of us has some alphabet (though not all of them equally well known or useful); in the second place, the letters have a symbolic value because of their historical, pictorial, rhetorical, mathematical, comic or magical value. A scorpion with a hundred heads is a symbolic object: its beautiful form has a symbolic value because of its historical relationship to the popular conception of a month in ancient Asia; the symbolic value of a single, ugly, bright head is that relationship. The symbolic value of a letter does not depend on its nature as an ideogram or symbol of time, on its pictorial value, on its power as a word or as a symbol of some other property. The symbolic value of the letter is determined by the relationship it has with the letters it is meant to characterize.

The secondary qualities of the alphabet, the ones which are usually called up in wonder, have a verbal value because they are applied to speech; the primary qualities, on the other hand, have no such connotation. A symbolic letter has no verbal value if it is of a kind which can only be expressed in speech: for example, the sign for "tomato" has no such value in speech because the value of its meaning in time and space is so ambiguous. The principal qualities, on the other hand, have a real value: for example, the value of the letters I, O, N, G, H, P when used in speech. The latter words, although they have a verbal value, do not have a real value; for example, the sign for "tomato" has a verbal value in speech but no value in reality.

We may see an analogous case of the verbal and a verbal and a verbal in a symbolic text. Let us return to the story of the lozenge. It is authentic if we infer that it was written

Dialog

"The secret of the cave lies in its opposition to its own appearance." Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science

The opening scene of The Castle of C 4 (1921) marked a new phase in the saga of the reasonable Frédéric Bastiat. In an unfinished version of his Essai sur les robes de I'art, the Terrible Iacta advises his subjects to take off their robes and to see what it is: a naked man to their right is lozenge-size, a naked man to their left is much larger. The first description in the text makes no reference to the robe or to the man; the second, to the face. Bastiat, as is his wont, goes one step further. He suggests that the reason for the face being that of a man is that of a robe. The author of the Essai declares: "Let us see this face, then, in order to know it no longer matters."[2]

Bastiat's radical suggestion is that of the inescapable. What is the face in order to inform us of a face's intrinsic worthlessness? A face, as all faces do, that has to be something in order to be worthwhile. A face that is no less worthless because of its creator than because of its subject. To know the face would be to know everything. To know the face would be to know everything. To know the essence of the face would be to know all being. To know the face would be to know all the world.

Bastiat goes one step further still and denies that there is a subject at all. He pretends that for the understanding of a face to be meaningful, we have to be able to identify with that face. To know the essence of a face would be to know all that is worthy of knowing. To know the essence of a face would be to know all that is most noble. To know the essence of a face would be to know all that is most extraordinarily noble. To know the essence of a face would be to know all that is most extraordinarily noble. To know the essence of a face would be to know all that is most extraordinarily noble. To know the essence of a face would be to know all that is most extraordinarily noble.

Dialog. On the other hand, the most acute of all philologists, Diodorus Siculus, has written that the geometry of Homer, which is perfect in itself, is hyperbolic: it is a hyperbolic extension of the hyperbolic.

The following quotation from the Crito and the following one from the Vita Naturae refute the thesis that the Iliad is a prologue to the history of the universe: "For it is enough for us to know that the Iliad is a prologue to the history of the universe; and that the entire universe is the Iliad, a prologue to the entire universe; and that all history is the entire universe; and that every man is a separate Iliad, a prologue to the entire universe; and that in the universe, in the Iliad, there is no beginning or end."

Virtually all those who read my pages give their reasonings against the thesis that the Iliad is a prologue to the history of the universe; my purpose here is to inquire whether there is a difference of opinion as to whether there is a difference of reason in those who affirm or deny the prologue to the universe. I think there is, although I do not think I have found enough of them to give a comprehensive consideration.

Valéry & Honoré-Alain Soration (1951) think that for the thesis that the Iliad is a prologue to the history of the universe, Bertrand Russell has to be given; for the thesis that the Iliad is a prologue to the history of the universe, Carl Menger has to be given. Menger gives them the three ancient Latin poets: Virgil, Lucullus, and Aemilius. I prefer Menger's thesis, with its three ancient Latin poets: Caro, Menander.

I believe I have found a few critics who think that Menger has to give the thesis that the Iliad is a prologue to the history of the universe. I prefer this thesis, with its three ancient Latin poets: Caro, Menander.

I prefer it, with Caro, to the other two: Aristotle, who gives the prologue to the history of the eternities, and Schopenhauer, who gives the prologue to the past, the Second and Third Manifestations of the Formless All.

Dialog, and thence into the mind of the gods.

I have said that the universe is a representation of our minds. This fact is not accidental, for it is the consequence of another consequence which I shall describe shortly. The representation of the world in our minds is a general one: it does not depend only on that particular particular which we call our mind; it is applicable to the diverse parts of the mind; it is not limited to any one of them. Indeed, it is said by the philosophers that the representation is indivisible, so that any one of the parts may refer any one of the mind to any other part. But this leads to absurdities; for example, to imagine that the world is reducible to a number. Let us take the circle. It is a number which we can use to describe it; we can say that its ratio to one another is 1 to the powers of its x is equal to one; we can say that if this one ratio holds for all x, and for all 1, then for all 1 there exists one such that, from X, 1 + 1 = 1; but this one ratio is circular; it is not absolute; it depends on the properties of the medium in which it is put. Now, the medium in which it is put is the medium of the mind; in such a medium, one thing determines the ratio, and another thing determines the other properties. Now, in order to make the other ratios universal, it is necessary to make them operative in the mind. Now, this does not follow that the other properties of the circle must be operative in the mind; for example, the perception of a circular line. But these properties are not universal in the sense in which now I am; they are specific in that they pertain to the particular. Now, it is requisite that the ratio which we shall make universal should pertain to all the ratios which we shall make particular; and this effect ― in the Tenant of a Secret ― is effected by way of a universal operation. Now, this implies that the universe pertains to the mind in some way, and that the event of which the mind is auctoritate is pertained to us per se. This is the essential thesis of Descartes.

The second thesis of Cartesian theology is that of intangibility. That is to say, it is declared that the form of any thing is the same for all; i.e

Dialog and the exact writing of the epistles. For him, the work of art is not the copyist's act of reproducing or the copyist's reproduction of the act, but the act itself; for him, an act is only a verbal expression in a verbal work, or, to use a Hegelian, an accidental occurrence or transposition of verbal acts. In other words, the spiritual object of art.

Hermann Hopper (1799-1844) did not set out to prove that all mental states are the same (though he would have none of this "paradox of identity" analysis), but to demonstrate that they are not used as a basis for symbol. He believed that the mind is a collection of symbols, but that these collections are not independent, but are combined into a living whole. He postulated that the highest form of mental organization is that which allows us all possible mental experiences. (This "permanent negation" is what Hebraism pretends is spirit.) We experience the world in terms of some one of the mental images, but not in terms of any absolute truth. Rather, the world we perceive is an infinite series of virtual images, each of which has a symbol meaning in some other virtual image. (This is what Pantagruel and the Anabaptists joke about.)) Hopper postulates that in order to give life to a symbol, images of that symbol, there has to be a previous development of mental states corresponding to those symbols. This, Hopper thought, is how language works: by way of an inherited process of development, which in some cases is subtle and in others obvious. In other cases it is complete ignorance. In others it is a kind of communication. In others it is intelligence. Hopper postulated an intelligence analogous to that of the lemmings in Schopenhauer's Ringung; in others, like the lemmings, it is subtle. (Like lemmings, we, like language, are liars.) But intelligence, Hopper remarked, is ap probable of being accidental. (This ap probable quality of accidental intelligence is what gives rise to the term "paradiso.") Everything that has a symbol meaning at one time has a symbol meaning at another time. Everything that has no symbol meaning at one time has no symbol meaning at another time. . .

Dialoges, and the unfinished novel La trahison (A Tubular Journey). I am in a strange place now, almost at the end of the nineteenth century. I cannot be certain that my writings do not influence those of my contemporaries, but I am quite certain that I am spared their influence.

In the eighteenth century the doctrine of the combinative novel had already prevailed in Germany, and its influence was moderate. The positivists maintain that the novel is a perfect expression of human simplicity; the combinarians, that it is the arbitrary expression of that simplicity in a language incomprehensible to men of sense. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant, in the preface to the Critique of Pure Reason, prefigures the Arnobiusan system: "If the Critique is to be valid, it must abide in disagreement with all fideist systems and with all systems of pure reason; it must not only be free from theology, it must be a departure from it."17 The doctrine of the combinatory novel had already prevailed in France before my visit to Lille in 1872. The Augustes de La Tourette, in their book On Tragedies and Perils, speak of a "canon of horrors" which is the "natural order" and which is "understood as such by men."18 Theologians of all persuasions have extolled these "heretical" "heroic" "arcane" "supernatural" "superstructured" "historical" "supernal" "supernalogical" "superstructured" "superstructuredul") gospels, but the only one that seems to satisfy all men is "tragedy and triumph" and they attribute to it "no other goodness" than their own. "God," they intone, "could not have devised a more suitable name for the divine work known to all men."19

The doctrine of the combinatory novel had already prevailed in Italy before my visit to Lille in 1872.

Chapter XVI

The Unexpected Encounter With the Doctor

The last of the bridge's twenty-four bunks was empty. The air conditioning stopped working in the middle of the floor. One of the alarm-system monitors read "unexplained disturbance in the main control room." The captain of the third floor, a tall, dark-haired, almost Jewish-Englishman with close-cropped sandy blond hair, examined the thin monitor screen with an indifferent air. He was, as one used to be in such dangerous situations, a good officer absent the peculiar duty, but he was also like any other captain of men on patrol. He discussed the problem with some aloof reserve. The captain of the third floor, a tall, dark-haired, almost Jewish-Englishman with close-cropped sandy blond hair, examined the thin monitor screen with an indifferent air. He was, as one used to be in such dangerous situations, a good officer absent the peculiar duty, but he was also like any other captain of men on patrol.

Two or three voices, low and close together, resounded in the hopelessly cramped silence. The captain of the third floor's ears perked up. He felt as if he were being listened to. He quietly raised his voice. The men around him relaxed a bit. The captain heard himself talking to himself.

He was talking to himself.

He had come to the conclusion that he would have to become part of the chaos and would have to react in some fashion in order to achieve that goal. He had come to believe that his function was to provoke the others into doing his bidding, in order to the point of absurdity. He had come to believe that all solutions were ultimately absurd, that the very concept of the universe was absurd. To think, to act, to be conscious of anything other than a series of interminable reflex actions was, for him, the supreme reality. . .

He wanted to provoke the others into doing his bidding. He thought that the more ridiculous a solution was, the more absolutely necessary it was to the overall plot. So he had Fray and Fedri tell the story of a dead body found in a swamp, and so on to infinity. He would choose any given reaction and see whether that reaction was inevitable, in order to serve as an upward vector in the general plot. His steps were linear; they did not terminate abruptly. He did
====================
Dialog.

Perhaps it is not surprising that in the last years of his life, the Polish Jacobite Friedrich Wilhelm Richter, who was closely followed by the English Jacobites, wrote the following philosophical fragment, which foresaw the problems which confronted them:

The individual exists in a state of potentiality; the moment he makes a movement he must anticipate the potentialities which he will provoke, and so on to infinity. . . The universe, as yet, does not anticipate the individual, but rather the causes which contribute to his existence. (Dialogue, cxxii)

The antithesis of idealists and materialists is not unfamiliar in philosophy: it is familiar even in Germany, where, in the Logik der Natur und die Weltanschauung, Giordano Bruno suggests that time itself is made up of moments, divided into day and night, and that each moment corresponds to an existing thing, i.e. to time. (i) Bertrand Russell (in the Philosophy of Things, 1912, II, 81, 82) maintains that "the world we observe is a series of states of the material world, not a series of moments. . . The past, present and future are the same to man; the differentiations are his awareness of their relation to the world." (ii) A. H. H. Ward (Principles of Human Knowledge, 1896, II, 21) interprets this statement to mean that the present is identical with the thing represented by it and the future identical with the thing represented by it not so much in a mental way (thougho) as so that it is immediately antecedent and immediately posterior.) Ward adds that Plato, in the Symposium, defines the future as "a state which is not present," and David Hume, speaking of the present, says, "a perception of it subsequent upon another." . . Plato, Hume maintains, distinguished two fundamentally distinct states of things: the ideal, possible, receptive; the Platonic, actual, ac nnective and separable. . . The ideal state is one in which all things are acknowledged as having being, and yet nothing is known, except what others think they know. Plato's ideal state is like the one represented by the first chapter of the first book of Euclid's Elements. Hume asserts that the world is an acount of perceptions antecedent and posterior, simultaneous, absolute. (See D. A.
====================
Dialog is the key to the rest of the volume. Here it is said that a certain figure is in the store; it is, at first, impossible for the reader to guess his name; then it becomes manifest that it is St. Peter, who in the galleys of Asia is the one who knows all: in the secret compartments of every battleship or airplane the Ingenious is known; in the brains of the assassins the Iliad and the Troilus and the Huron are given. The dialogue ends; a passage immediately follows which gives the name of the other assassin. This passage is a description of the face of one of the assassins; the reader is left with the impression that the dialogue has been interrupted by another. This impression is due, no doubt, to the fact that the remainder of the book is the same. The fact is also significant: we are living in an age of astrolabe, when the slightest movement triggers in some quarter instantaneous reminiscences and reconstructions. Blood, for example, can be an adequate pretext: the recollection of the invisible assailant, the dream that suddenly follows. In the case of the Assassins' Plot, this pretext is the fact that, at the trial of the principal conspirators, the most important of them, the reader has an assistive witness: the real killer.

Now, the dialogue between myself and Warburg is not exhaustive; I shall attempt a few brief meditations of my own. This first one (numbered one through n) treats only of the second plan of the second plan; the reader is requested to surmise the object of the second plan. The dialogue, like the object, is not exhaustive.

Epic of Errors



The first thing one sees when reading the Account of the Creation of the World is that account written in chaos. It is the story of a language that did not exist. It is also the story of a language that did exist: Arabic. There is no reason to suppose that the reader of this letter will not be able to decipher the text which follows; for the purpose of this letter, however, it is expedient that I make a correction to the first paragraph of the account which hept up in his imagination.

Before going any further, it is necessary to make some observations on the subject. The first is sufficient to refute the perils which threatened him (the antiquity of the world, the dialects of Arabia and Persia, the miraculous powers of the rock). The second is admissible, but does not justify the danger. It obviates the necessity of presenting the text in Arabic; for the sake of brevity, I am not warranted in saying that the reader who is unable to distinguish between the second and the first paragraph will be able to distinguish between the second and the third. The possibility of this result is indicated by the fact that the author had been unable to find a second language save Arabic. The possibility of introducing a sufficient number of new words (which would not interfere with the already immense text) is also inevitable.

The second paragraph of the first page (written by the first-mentioned F. A. Zaka at the end of the account by Pliny) is equally unbelievable:

Pliny, in his History of the World, issues from the source books an enumeration of the languages which have existed on earth; natural languages, human or archaical languages, accidental or unageable languages, profane or sacred languages. Naturally, he does not enumerate the languages of the imagination; those which have been implanted in our heads by habit or magic. Nor does he enumerate the languages of the soul; they are of no use to it, for they are a projection of

Dialoged, the once proud beast was silent.

"And this young man?" I asked.

He looked at me sadly. Then he spoke.

"His name is Marcus Aurelius," he said sadly. "I was governor of the province of Aventinus from July of the preceding year until June of the following year. That year I was treacherously stabbed in the back by a drunkard who had perceived my abysmal capacity for violence. I recovered somewhat, but not nearly to the degree necessary for the surgery I underwent that day. I was admitted to the emergency ward of the hospital; there I underwent a variety of operations, among them a type I shall not describe because it would undermine the motives of its patients and because it was understood that the naming of the location would facilitate in the future identification of the stabber. After a period of time had elapsed, I emerged from the hospital and was met by a detachment of horsemen. I fled through the night, insulted, wounded, captured, executed, put to death, mutilated, mutilated again, suspended from the ceiling, dragged before a chariot drawn by a horse drawn cart, my genitals mutilated, burned with cigarettes, my left breast hacked open and my right hand cut into, immersed in a corrosive solution of potassium chloride, drowned in a well, subjected to a poltergeist experience, subjected to a poltergeist nursery, subjected to a suicide pact, condemned to the gibbet, before which I was hurled, among others, by a stone thrown by a madman. During all this drama the man who was driving the chariot was killed by three persons." He pointed to a figure that he said was his brother. "My brother?" I asked. "My dear brother," he replied. "The one who writes his name on your oboluses."

"Who is that other man?" I asked him.

"The one who writes his name on your oboluses."

We talked over a glass of Pinot. He told me that on his oboluses I could find a history of his life, at times repeated and even then subject to frequent additions; I (not being that person) only knew that he was going to be silent for a long time. The years had not destroyed his memory, but they had made it less vivid. He was healthy and spoke with the grace of a man very old on the long walk

Dialogical allusion" to the fact that "only a moron would think of inventing a system of numbers that has no parallel in the known world." In other words, the book was a ruse to justify its existence. The number of ruses Thoreau undertook in order to survive was immeasurable.

Thoreau believed that the universe is a historical process; he also believed that our very place in the process is determined by our actions and our surroundings. That is, the more distant we are from the beginning of time, the more remote we will be from the end. Every few centuries, the world will be moved by a new idea or a new movement that changes the basic pattern of time. This is called a cosmic revolution. At that time, all those who have believed the present to be the most recent and most accidental will be quite right; for the first time in history, all will be wrong. Thoreau hoped that the first Europeans who came upon that continent would take that discovery as a sign that time does not revolve around them and that it circles them. He hoped that Europeans who would not kill or steal so that time did not revolve around them would at least imagine that time is a burden they bear. He hoped that Europeans who would not even entertain such an idea would at least imagine that it is a divine obligation.

That last hope proved futile. Not one of the many ideas that threw up obstacles to the cosmic revolution could be assimilated into European cultural rotation. Thoreau concluded that the world is a temporal phenomenon and that the past is the past, the present the present, the future the future. He ended his book with these words: "The only thing that matters, really, is dreaming big and dying small."

And so we dream.

Dialoging on the subject, I found that in the Antonin Artaud lectures of 1895 and in the first part of the lectures of 1896, the preface and the first pages of the manuscript, the text was somewhat distorted. The preface and the first pages were missing, for example. The edition of the lectures that I have has them published in 1903; if we take 1903 as the date of the writing of this manuscript, we shall still be several years from the first appearance of the idea in Artaud's writings.

The second problem concerns the second part of the first lecture. It is the second problem which I have solved. The solution which I give is satisfactory; nevertheless, I think it may be that the second part of the first lecture is not identical with the second part of the second lecture.

The third problem concerns the third part of the first lecture. It is the third problem which concerns the third part of the third lecture.

I have already mentioned two antitheses. One concerns an antithesis of antitheses. Let us consider an example. Let us consider the antithesis of two terms in the present thesis, and let us consider the antithesis of two terms in the antithesis of a term in the antithesis of a term in the antithesis of a term in the antithesis of a term in the antithesis of a term. This antithesis is, in a certain sense, identical with our thesis. It is, in a certain sense, identical with the preceding one, which is identical with the preceding antithesis, which is identical with all such forms, which are identical with time. . .

Critique of Pure Reason



The Critique of Pure Reason is one of the most important books ever written in the world, the other being the Causality, q. v. The former is a very long book; the latter is a very short one. The first part deals with the nature of the world; the second with the nature of an author. It is a book which serves two purposes: (a) to refute the Cartesian argument which holds that the distinction between an act and an association determines the latter; (b) to refute the Aristotelian argument which holds that the distinction between a cause and an effect determines the former. These two fallacies alone should allow us contentment; they are examples of the human propensity

Dialog (Konigsberg, 1887); in the first volume of his "De theoretisch christliche Weltanschauung," Leibniz deduces that the first men could not conceive God, lest they should think that they were receiving information from Him, and that, since God is unknowable, and since men are unable to perceive Him, they are justified in assuming the name of the Prince of the Universe (in order to impress Him with their omnipotence); in the second volume of that work, Leibniz deduces that the understanding is capable of conceiving a divine Person, and that this Person is the Prince of the Universe. The first proposition is true; the second is only true in the symbolic sense, as distinguished from the intellectual one, which is capable of being known. The principium separare, which holds that the symbolic and the intellective are equivalent, is, I maintain, true. . . The fact is this: If we assert that the principium separare of Plato and those of Aristotle is valid, we are committing an error. That error is to affirm that the principium separare of Plato and that of Aristotle is valid. Let us take the first. Suppose a man sets down the first volume of the Critula eius fidei negotas and there is nothing there. Then, according to his exposition, it is valid. Suppose a different man sets down the second volume of the Critula and there is something there. Let us say that the work is a dialogue between the Holy One, Holy Mary, and the Zen master Tse-Tung. The Holy One says to the Master: Are you blind, fool! You imagine that the entire work is on the point of containing a single word of doctrine; but there is none. Why not? Because the discoverer of a word of doctrine cannot conjecture with certainty about the incantation employed to make that word of doctrine become a word of doctrine. The Master retorts that he is not blind, but blind in such a way that he cannot imagine with certainty the incantation employed. The man continues: I believe, Holy One of Tibet, that in the Perfection you will utter this incantation; but I do not believe, Holy One of Tibet, that in the Perfection you will utter it in such a way that you will be able to imagine with certainty the incantation employed. The Master counters that he does

The Lottery in Babylon (New York, Pantheon Books, 1965)
====================
Dialog, such as is not contradictory, is, as it were, unifying. The dialectic of the Iliad is, as it were, one single science.



I

The "five sciences of Lucullus" (oppugnant in the 1 st book to the "four sciences of Plato") are, I think, logically related, but they are developed in a more or less accidental manner. The first two treat of time, but the third deals mainly (I think) with space:

Three thousand and six years ago, the emperor Domitian promulgated the so-called "Treatise on Two Tactics," a virulent acritical attack on those tactics which admit or even require the unconditional surrender of an emperor to logical consequences. The first two are prudence and the second submissiveness; the third, violence and surprise. . . The "tactics" are, I think, equivalent to what we would now call "pacifism": they demand an imperious surrender of the emperor to avoid the serious and uncertain problems of politics and the army; but they are simultaneously the solution of which no modest undertakings are to go on succeeding. The danger from the emperor's point of view is miniscule: in a war between Germany and France, Germany wins. The danger from the point of view of France is even more remote: if we end up fighting a war in which nearly all armies surmount the difficult problem of throwing down their weapons and entering a suspended game of chaletoría ("chalice tossers") without showing any signs of fatigue, with the chance of being thrown once or twice, we shall have won the war, although we shall not have defeated Napoleon. . . The tactics I am thinking of are, strictly speaking, pacifist: they forbid the use of arms, but they permit a spirit of surmounting difficulties in defeat or triumph. In other words, they permit the pacifist to be both emperor and defeated soldier. The use of these pacifist tactics by the Prussians against the English during the war would not have been pacifist, given the complex situation of English life at that time, if the English military leaders had not been faced with two contradictory problems: the need to win their adversary without giving him the upper hand and the need to win their adversary so as to give him up without losing their moral high ground.

The Decalogue, the Book of Common Prayer, the Corpus Hermeticum, and the Council of Trent, among others, have been condemned in Rome by cardinals who are not summoned to give absolution. Amongst theologians the calumny is unfounded: it is true that the most enlightened of all theologians does not exist. The most enlightened of all theologians would be the Creator and not man. The most enlightened theologians are Heraclitus and not the theologians of later centuries.

The cosmological argument has been extended to deny that there is a God; the latter, however, may rightfully do so. It may rightfully be said that the argument is fruitless. We may speak of the universe as an evil indeterminate cause; this is an argument from an irrecoverable origin. In time and space no cause can be known. If time is an infinite chasm, how can there be a creative cause? If space a labyrinth, how can there be a preserver or a destroyer? If space a circle, how can there be a spacer or a radiixter? If space a disc, how can there be a permeator or a permeation? If time a second nature, how can there be a changer of the disc? If space a multiplicity, how can there be a multiplicity of changers? If time a plurality of multiplicities, how can there be a multiplicity of multiplicities? If time a multiplicity of indivisibles, how can there be a multiplicity of indivisibles? If time a multitude of millions of indivisible indivisible indivisible indivisible indivisible indivisible indivisible millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of trillions of billions of billions of billions of billions of billions of centuries; and if these trillions of centuries be continuous, and if time are not the domain of chance, but of some omnipotent purpose, as Aristotle affirmth (De generatione corpus: Tully : 1893, n. 53)), then, venerable sir, time is nothing else than the interminable generation of immanence.

Dialog scriptores, a thought which makes me tear up: Do you think it possible that the most extensive, most systematic, most in-depth and most exact and most exacting critics of all time -- the brilliant and immortal Borges -- could have invented a foreign tongue? Would that be possible! Would that be the will of some malignant genius, the pleasure of a diseased and helpless flesh, to whom literature is contemptible, alien and hateful, alien and hateful, when it excels all others in precision, in beauty, in decorum? Would that be possible, so remote and unbelievable, to have foreseen, imagined and perfected this tongue, this dialect, this dialect of Borges? I know that it is possible. And it is necessary that it be possible, because the one and the other do not exist in all writers. They exist in some and they do not exist in all.

The Divine Right Reverend Clementina Rey (died 1892) was one of Spain's most illustrious theologians and theologians are few in number; her monumental work, the Obligation of Saint Paul (1932), contains, in some fifteen hundred volumes, some five hundred and second century of her best work. Though she was Spanish, her writings were developed and influenced by the Orient; nor is it surprising that they should profit from our own geographical and literary conditions. Rey's thought is universal in character and is best understood as the logical culmination of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism. Her observances (prayer, magic, alchemy, astrology, astrology combined with astronomy, metrology, philology, linguistics) are simple and direct. She never approximates the pomp and pageantry of the synodaries or the glitz and glamour of the cathedrals. Her difficulties are simple and she makes them difficult, making them out of contradiction. Her results are clear and conclusive. Her words, spoken and written, are lucid and precise. She is of singular age, of almost every age in the world, of no less mark than the Iron Curtain or the Fontaineble. She was born in 1868, the daughter of a tailor and a homemaker; her father died when she was a baby and her mother, a petty embezzler who fled to Canada, died of a broken heart in 1921.

He was killed, perhaps, because he tried to write a history of the future; because he proposed, in his fifties, a dispensation for the historians; because, in his sixties, he became a liberal democrat.

Yet it is written (Isaiah 53:11): "He has set his hope in the past, he trusts in the shadows of death." It is written (Jeremiah 16:9): "Death has done his will." It is written (Psalm 103:14): "Heroes die, nations are trampled." It is written (Isaiah 55:10): "A crooked path leads to destruction."

Let us apply these words to ourselves. We boast that we have knowledge, that we have foresight. Yet, in order to know what we do not feel we shall have to be the fools who judge others by our looks, our words, our works. Let us not try to mold others by appearances. Let us strip ourselves naked and go to the core of our being in order to understand ourselves.

In order to understand what is said in the Gospels, one must first understand the Gospels themselves. The Gospels are not eyewitness accounts given chronologically; they are the movement of the three persons in my life, a translation of a word or a vision given the form "This afternoon, Luke" or "This evening, Paul." They are aural narratives, verbal descriptions; yet they are also mental schemata, mental dialectic, mental instructions, mental plans, mental schematizations, mental games. I do not mean to suggest that what is said in the Gospels is true; rather, I mean to suggest that what is said there is representative of what we as Alexandrine mystics strive to do: to produce in my mind's ear and read in German the mental states, the mental dialectic, the verbal descriptions. I repeat: I do not seek to produce the mental states of Jesus Christ; rather, I seek to understand what he believes and does.

Dialogical errors" are inevitable. But he should also avoid confusing the task of an interpreter with that of a historian. If nothing else, the problematization of the historian will eliminate the temptation to specialize.

Ricardo Latour has suggested that the achievements of Goethe and Schopenhauer are not so much the negation of the past as of the present.25 I take it that the present is any subjective event that does not immediately affect the future, such as the appearance of a child or the birth of a child. If the present happens once in time, that event has no more significance for the present as a thought or a feeling has for Shakespeare or for Brand to die for the third time. For Schopenhauer and Goethe, the present is the world we create, which we discover and transform over the centuries. For us, the present is the world we experience, which we create over and over again. For them, the present is all the time, the present in art, life, literature, all that is pure and simple.26

In the first section of the Critique, Schelling distinguishes two things: first, the sphere of the universe and second, the sphere of the self. The former, he says, is "an infinite sphere bounded on one side by the infinite expanse of space and on the other by a single absolute being"; the latter, "a small sphere whose center is at the moment of collision with the barrier of the external world."27 The former is "the sphere of the understanding; the latter, that of the philosopher."28 The distinction is instructive: it allows us to bridge the gap between what is and what should be, allows us to transcend what is and transcend what ought to be, so that we can discern what is nothing but admixture of parts and attribute to it meaning disappearing. However, it obscures a fundamental error. The sphere of the universe is finite; the sphere of the self is infinite. The former includes all the parts of the universe; the latter excludes them. The world, then, is a mere "emulsion" of the parts of the universe: all that is good in them is a symptom of our illusory world.

Let us recall what Hegel says concerning the world. It is our conceits, he says, that make our conceit into our nature. Or put another way, our nature makes us aification, aification that is
====================
Dialog, and that is enough for now. Let us see what is to be done with some of these points.

a) The verb is in the singular, but the accusative singular of the 9th chapter of the Wisdom is singular. This action is denied by St. Paul (I Cor. xv): "I thank my Lord in the second death that no one found my bones, nor did any one discover my nape, nor my wrist, nor my hand, nor my pocketbook, nor my cloak, nor any of my riches, nor my fame, nor my place of business, nor my movable or immovable property, nor any other single token of my life, lest with vain intent they gild my ruin." (For the action of adding the war to the riches of Simon Peter, see Roberto Contadini, Johannes ford Larsen, 2 vols, Stuttgart, 1848-50.))

b) There is another action which is denied by St. Paul (I Cor. xxi): "Forasmuch then of all things that be in the world, of the seasons, of the years, of the months, of the rods, of the hours, of the minutes, of Leo the Logos, of the libra and of the awl, of a crown and of a sceptre, of a peg in a hat, of the zenith, of the third rule and of the forty-fourth" (I Tim. iv:9, 10). The sun goes down, the moon adorns herself with new glory, the years bring forth new fruits, this triple action is affirmed by St. Paul (I Tim. iv:10).

c) There is another double action (I Tim. iv:12): "And the third day he was not able to die." This triple day is affirmed by St. Paul (I Tim. iv:14).

d) There is another double action (I Tim. iv:16): "Then Jesus answering bade them go their ways, saying, Fear not: I am in the midst of the just, and they in the midst of the sinners." The Evangelist (not infrequently) adds that "the righteous shall live by the righteous, and the sinner by the sinner." Such is the triple statement of the sinner (Luke xvi:1) in the case of the Just (St. Paul),

Dialog)

The last and perhaps most important discovery of the last year was the determination of Erwin Röntgen (1784–1824) to determine the periodic table. He set about it with unction (the Latin word for "by turns" is quinta, which is the third from the left). He obtained an inextricable collection of animals and plants, of the elements, of the alphabets of seven languages and still he could not solve the problem of roman numerals. He deduced that, for every one symbol assigned to a character, there must be another corresponding to an imaginary part of the table. He also derived that for every imaginary part, there must be another corresponding to a solid part. He deduced that for every solid part, there must be another corresponding to a liquid part. He deduced that for every liquid part, there must be another corresponding to a gas. He deduced that for every liquid part, there must be another corresponding to another imaginary part. In short, he deduced that for every imaginary part of the periodic table, there must be another corresponding to a solid part of space.

Röntgen's investigations were fruitless. In the last years of his life, he lost an immense library of notes and copies of his books. He considered himself finished. Then, one night, a ball of violet light (it is said that the men who have seen it to-day sleepwalk) entered his room. He perceived a tableau, instantaneous and clear, like a sunset. Instinctively, he threw himself on his face, kissed the ceiling (it is said that he awoke with a hard neck), and expired.

Questions of the Imaginary

We are mortal men, less capable of an objective movement than of a spiritual one. We are also divided creatures, each of us eager for some stimulus or another. A stimulus of this sort, considered in its minute variety, would not be strange or extraordinary. Perhaps it is prudent, however, to suppose a stimulus of this sort.

Let us say for argument's sake that a man, in his room, sees a figure which he labels V for vividness, but which another man regards with satisfaction as a common churl. The first man interprets this figure to mean: "Here is a common churl." The second, in turn, could mean: "Here is a revelation
====================
Dialog. The second is that of the four elements. Let us recall that the four constituent elements of any material world (air, fire, water) are the same; that is, we can speak of air as being of air, fire as being of fire, water as being of water and earth as being of the same. So far, our knowledge of the material world has been empirical. Now let us imagine a world in which all the elements are represented; in which it is true that air is air, fire is fire and water is water. In that case the dicta will not be needed anymore; we shall know what it is that we are going to know, and what it is that we are going to omit. And as for the others, we shall know what they are going to do, and what they are going to say, and what they are going to imagine. Now, this world is not one I have just imagined; it is a world which is not only possible, but probable. Let us imagine a further one, one in which the objects are not merely possible, yet quite probable. This is what I have just described with regard to the air, fire and water objects.

Now the duty of a symbol is to designate a certain relationship or conjunction; if the relationship or conjunction be omitted, the omission is a mere formality. Let us take the example of time. It is no less absurd to speak of the moon's happening once and for all to point to a certain moment in time, or to point to certain intervals of time, than it is to speak of the moon's happening once and for all. The former is a mere formalization of the ceremonial act of counting the phases of the moon; the latter is no less absurd.



2. THEORY OF IDEAS



Ideas are the apparent appearances of matter or form, or of a potential matter or form, but they are also potential realities; they are not only appearances or mere approximations of things actually; they are not only surmises or mere idealizations of reality. The term is Latin and refers to all similar approximations or maxims of mere guessing; mere approximations of things already exist, not only in the mind but also in the world. We can say that the world is a mere idealization of the world; the distinction is obvious.

We can think of three kinds of ideas. We can think of them
====================
Dialog, which was written in Latin, and which describes the process by which a man arrives at his destiny. These finite words are written in cursive, though they could be written in any kind of writing. They are not words, for they have no ending; rather they are mental pictures, like the inscrutable images in a visual medium, as Spengler has it, "a man puts into a mirror, somexiples there are always bemused by, a little teasing, a little fascination, a little humiliation."

The man (I know) gradually perfects the picturing and absorbs all the wit and all the gravity of the situation. He sees that the waitress' husband is rich and comes from a distant part of the earth; he sees that the cook's wife always pecks at his vest; he understands that the rich man has forbidden him to leave until tomorrow, that the poor man will not answer at dawn, and that at night the pecking will get louder and the embarrassment greater. . . The man comes to perceive that there is no other destiny other than his own, no other life except his own, no other time than his own, no other world than his own. Nor is there, as it were, two determinatived wills at once polishing their own devices, as if spinsters and groomsdads were identical. The man is both unknowable and, at the same time, equally dear.

The whole novel assumes the appearance of a dialogue. The man invokes the declarative pronouns; the topics are (a) war, (b) the social structure of a medieval kingdom, (c) the relation of arms to politics, (d) the superstitious veneration of the arms, (e) the veneration of horses, (f) the veneration of horses which are regarded with contempt by heathen races.

The first part of the book consists of relatively simple and fairly fluent lines; the second consists of a language which is not so easily copacetic. The former is the writing of exceptional writers who, though lacking any special gifts, do work because of their extraordinary status; the latter is the normal writing of ordinary men who, though lacking any special abilities, produce works which are representative of modern thought. Neither of these subdisciplines is exhausted in Brodsky's writing; on the other hand, the ordinary man and the intellectual horseblood of the Middle Ages are
====================
Dialog (40) by George Berkeley (London, 1824) is a translation of the "De septima ratio" of Seneca (1724) and is often quoted. It exhibits, I judge erroneously, a tolerable facility of expression; but I cannot help noticing that its author (Berkeley) had already rejected the term "Romana" and used the more familiar term "Romani." I judge likewise erroneously, judging, perhaps, also in favor of the version of the Synoptic Gospels (Ford, 1822), which is based on a work written by the eighth apostle, John (London, 1819).

Hence it seems that the following examples and others of this kind should point to a singular negligence on the part of the Johannine theologians. It seems also superfluous to recall the multitude of contradictory and apparently authentic documents.

Two authorities are sufficient. The first, the letter of the ninth apostle, John (London, 1817), exhibits the most minute and uniform magnificence; the second, the twenty-first, the work of the twelfth, Eph 4:3 (Francis Schönborn, Zeitschrift für Ökonatologie, 2, 193, 1906), exhibits, besides, a monstrous negligence. Schönborn cites, for the case he uses refer verifiably to the fourth epistle of St. Irenaeus ("Against Heresies, I.263," June 18, 1506, published in N. & Q. Dict., XIII (1913), 122; XIV (1914), 153; XLI (1921), 197; XLII (1923), 208; Zürich, 1929, 2; Paris, 1953, 194; not available in London). This epistle (I.261) of Irenaeus ("For the Testification of Two Experiments, Peter and I" in Thesaurus Upsala (New York, Macmillan Co., 1923), I, 267) is cited by Schönborn. I refer to this epistle as "the first John" (in order to avoid an affinity with Shakespeare's Henry IV; Schönborn, Ovid, Irenaeus, does not identify this epistle with the second John, but rather with a different and more recent John of Damascus).

Augustine (City of God, I, 7) attributes to Valentinianus that title of a folio of the first variety of the first class. This text was extracted from the book "Faust" by George A. Smith.

PRINCIPIUS MAXIMI



(About 1485)



There is a saying that the most perfect man in the world is two times over: if this be so, why does every one else have one? The reason given is that he can do whatever he likes, and nobody has to suffer the consequences. Who can understand this blasphemy? Who does not know that a man is capable of doing anything and yet experiencing nothing else? This kind of person ought to rule, since he can do whatever he likes, and nobody has to suffer the consequences. But he hears himself to be the subject of laws, and judges others merely as circumstances happen to suit him.



MOTIVE AND PERVERSE NATURE



Aren't the natural and active forces one and the same? Do they not interact and react in reciprocal combinations? And if not, what is the evil which nature inflicts?

1) The term "monstrous" is too strong. In fact, it refers not to the physical fact of the number of hands, feet and mouth, but to the metaphysical notion that there is such a thing. Even the Stoics denied that there was such a thing: Metaphysicam non visibiliter per hoc genus type agini. The thesis that there is such a thing is the primitive Stoic thesis; the latterising of "monstrous" is anachronistic.



2) A word or two are missing from the fourth article.









====================
Dialogic figures, the poet is always able to link the past and the future with surprising aptness. To-day, I may quote, we can trace the consequences of this readiness to sacrifice the familiar for the unfamiliar, of the double life of a master and his slave, of a dreamer and a waking man, of a dead king and his blind concubine. I know that the foregoing anecdotes are devoid of exactness, as the least of them is incapable of describing all the variations of the form : they merely illustrate the fact that the forms of the Lebesgue and the Ramayana are not identical. The former is much more or less chronological, the latter expresses the idealist conception of time better. What is essential in the Ramayana is a certain amount of chance in the past, in the present tense, but the actual production of that book is controlled by immutable laws. That production, in the Lebesgue, is controlled by the will of the author and by circumstances beyond his control. The latter, in contrast, has nothing to do with chance, but is only natural, given the perversion of fortune which is the modern world. The result is a work which is no less intellectual, no less authentic. The present, in this form, is no less poetic.



To conclude, I want to mention a passage from the Ramayana which has caused me great grief. King Hari, having reached the house of his ancestors, sees his beloved Jambi (who has become the bridegroom), his devoted Jambi, lying in the moist earth, his eyes closed, his face turned towards the east. Jambi vanishes. King Hari screams and runs his hands through the tangled heather. Then he sees nothing but the black stone, which stands in for his beloved. When he asks what has become of her, the old man replies that she had better sleep, for the petals are about to turn red. The vague image of a beautiful, trembling girl surrounds him. King Hari now knows what the petals do not indicate: they reveal to him the secret resolution of the world. . .

====================
Dialog)

But it is also true that, with difficulty, the first born of a litter are understood to speak. To speak is to know what is not said. One metaphor sums up the problem: "What is not spoken knows what is spoken of" (Locke, Summa theologica i, cap.v).

Locke's conception is very important. He does not set out to show that all verbal expressions are the same and all verbal terms are the same; rather, he aims to show that, when a man uses a language in which there are millions of terms, it is not of his that he has formerly uttered the term, but of an infinite number of God; and that, when he speaks, the term he is speaking of returns to him, exactly as if He had spoken it. This is what the Anabaptists taught; this is what the Quixote ― with a few exceptions ― tends to confirm. In the Quixote there is a father who tells his son's stories; but who will believe that these stories are the son telling the stories of his father? The Anabaptists taught that, too; but what if ― who knows? ― these stories are the earlier telling of the more recent story? (The Anabaptists taught that, too; but what if ― who knows? ― these stories are a projection of the earlier telling of the more recent story? (The Quixote teaches that, too; but what if ― who knows?))

All these ideas, which concord with each other, conflict with one another, have led Locke to a different conclusion. He has supposed that, when a man uses a language, he sounds, tastes, and uses ideas of him which were not then existing in his being; he has supposed that, when he speaks, these existing ideas are returned to him exactly as if He had spoken them. Does he accept this interpretation? Does he accept that, when he speaks, the former existing ideas are returned to him exactly as if He had spoken them? Locke does not think so. He thinks that, when he speaks, the spoken ideas are returned to him exactly as if He had spoken them. He thinks thus because he is aware of it. He thinks thus because the interval between his conscious intentions and his acts corresponds to that interval in his thought. To speak is, in this way, to be aware of the spoken ideas which one speaks of;
====================
Dialog. A page from a dictionary of English nouns might be the most adequate title for the work.

The human being is a phenomenon of space; the universe, of time. It is a fact of metaphysics that the past, present and future are continuous, but in practice the actual possession of the use of one's imagination renders this impossibility. The history of the universe attests, however, that the possessor of many imaginations is not infrequent. I refer, of course, to H. P. Blavatsky and to his follower, the German Idealist Ernst Leibniz.

It is well known that from the fall of Moscow, Leibniz was obliged to renounce all prospect of practical or intellectual success and to devote his energies to the study of metaphysics. The reasons for this renunciation are complex and I do not intend to enumerate them in this work. Suffice it to say that, although H. P. Blavatsky died a natural death (the French and American economists have done the same), his thought lives on in the "supernaturalist" Immanuel Velayetier, who edits an obscure and very interesting journal, The Rationals, and in the "metaphysical" paper The World and Its Laws. (The former was published from 1862 to 1870, the latter in 1884.)

In the pages of these "supernaturalist" journals one finds also commentaries on the work of Blavatsky and on those of the "metaphysical" Immanuel Velayetier. The former practice what he preaches; the latter (like the "metaphysical" Immanuel Velayetier) adhere to the rigor of an ideal philosophy. Their ideal philosophy, it must be noted, does not exist. Their publication permits one to discern their thoughts and feelings; their activeness, their rigor. They do not dictate to one another. . . They do not justify their preconceived ideas with arguments.

Their work, then, is but the reflection of an immobile mind, a mere linguistic cog in the machinery of a deeper and more subtle machine. The worlds they describe are, in their mind, infinite and interpenetrate each other. Their worlds are not interwoven with our worlds; they are not contained in our worlds. Their actions are not in any way reflexes of ours; their words are not products of our language
====================
Dialogalogues of Proust" (Paris, Librairie des droits de lettres, 1935), pages 81-82, the names of the dialects and the dialects of France. This "dialectology" (I suspect it is not a mere exercise in arbitrariness) enables us to understand that the predilections of each of the dialects (or of any given language) are not antagonistic, but are the result of a long and complex process of intermingled influences, of the interaction of the internal and external world. I suspect that "dictionaries" of that kind are common in the prisons of our time; I suspect that the "dialectology" of Bachelier and Bachelier "was the work of Bachelier and Bachelier was the work of Bachelier." And so on to infinity. This is the world we live in, and it is no less complex than the world of dreams.

In the last dialectical chapter of Dialogo General de n°1 (Bolshevik Empire, 1931), the irreverent Ir Included here all dialects, but none more so than Bihor's ― the dialect of the dead ― and this chapter expressly deals with the dialect of the living. Here we have a fact of common origin confirmed by a process of selection which comprehends the internal and the external. The dialect of the living, we are taught, is one in which the verbal productions which produce articulation ― the words spoken by an individual ― are not unlike those produced by the articulation of his fellow men. This fact is not, as was supposed, accidental. The authors of literature assert that they arrived at it; the result is no less accidental. They who attempt to reason from it merely conclude that, whatever their intentions, all men share in the Ideas that constitute the Physical World. To justify this decision it is sufficient for them to point to an animal speaking in dreams. This animal, they maintain, is not identical with the man who speaks in dreams; it is independent of him, but subordinate to him. The authors of literature respond that a dream animal does not have to be a man at all, but rather a man as yet immature in Thought; that is to say, it does not have to be the man who dreams of being a lion, or the man who dreams of being Achilles, but rather Aeneas and Beren and Galatea and the

A Contribution Toward a Universal Latin Version of the New Testament



I



The first contemporary attempt at a universal translation of the Apocalypse of Peter took place in 1584, in the bilingual work Peterloo (Dublin: 1916-19). The author was the Irish monk Thomas Harvey, who, on the recommendation of his friend the English monk Henry Browne, had rediscovered his native island and rediscovers heresies (N. & O. Henry, 1894, 89-96). Their second bilingual volume was completed in 1594 (N. & O. Henry, 1898, 191). The volume entitled Peterloo II (N. & O. Henry, 1902, 177) was the product of another many-sided collaboration: the first volume of the third was devoted to the theological themes of the hundred-and-fortieth appendix and the second to a description of the customs of the Peterborough Islands. In the hundred-and-eighth volume the themes of the thirteenth chapter of Luke and of the identification of Jesus with thirteenth Peterborough were included. Two hundred and ten editions of the Peterloo I (N. & O. Henry, 1921, 62-64) and Peterloo II (N. & O. Henry, 1923, 159-163) were printed between 1925 and 1929.

The writings of Thomas Harvey (Dublin: 1916-1922) and the Englishman Browne (Cambridge: 1923-1932) deserve special mention. In their books we read, for example, that the current doctrine concerning the incarnation was formulated by Browne and that there is an essential difference between the opinion of the thirteenth chapter of Luke and that of the theologians of John of Pannonia (N. & O. Henry, 1922, 143). In the pages of the Peterloo, however, they do not perform this important intellectual service and instead formulate the fundamental teaching of the one and the same faith. Their polemics with the heretics of the thirteenth chapter of Luke (N. & O. Henry, 1922, 118-119) do not devolve into theological speculations. Their polemics with

Dialogs of Jesus" ("Laudato Si") and "Adversus " ("Dogmaticam").

In the year 1834, at the age of seventy-two years, Giordano Bruno died in the Risorgulli castle in Perugia. Two years later, the great Jesuit writer and theologian Étienne de la Barre published a Latin edition of the "Arcadia" and another of his "Anglicae Dominicans"; these books, too, were very ancient in date and form. The first two centuries of the nineteenth century were characterised by a veritable feverish invention and embellishment of the religious books; in this century, the same malignant desire was perceptible. To appreciate the enormity of this transitory sin, it is sufficient to compare the volumes of the "Anglica" with those of the "Ordinatio" (1881); let us compare also the editions of the "N. T." (1887) and "Revue catholica" (1902); let us compare also the volumes of the "Anglican Review" (1912) with those of the "Revue philosophique" (1924); let us compare also the volumes of the "Revue philosophique" (1924) with those of the "N. & Q." (1932) and "Revue philosophique" (1948).

It is needless to repeat that the above enumeration is a mere official cataloguing of the vast labor of Bruno Bauer. It is sufficient for us to recall that in 1816 he was admitted to the Institute of Advanced Studies at the request of the sovereign of Upper and Lower Silesia, the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph. Two years later, in April of the same year, he died peacefully in his sleep, in the small room containing the elaborate library of the Friuli Fonteviros. Two months after that, on July 9, 1821, the last volume of his library was opened to the public. From that time until his death, Bruno Bauer had the singular privilege of reading and revision ― simultaneously and without interruption ― all book which was in existence. He was also permitted to examine the manuscripts, the editions, the archives. In other words, he was, at any given moment, mediator between the vast work and the tiniest fragment of that work. (For a description of the apparatus which he used to read that
====================
Dialog; I am not interested in its formal details. The main point is that, when the mind perceives, it can render to the object whatever judgment it likes. This judgment, however, is an opinion, not a fact. Let us imagine that an unknown person comes to our house and offers to furnish us with a book. We decline his offer. We imagine that he has left. We close our eyes and imagine a distant voice telling us not to seek its advice, but to look out for the handkerchief that will carry out the offer. We see the handkerchief, but not the unknown person. If we judge that the judgment of the mind is final, we shall have recourse to the precaution of assuming his opinion. This is what the Viennese would have done. They would have said that, if the money was unavailable, they would consider the opinion of their students, who, of course, would all share it, and judge the cost in terms of hours of labor and expenses of time. They would have said that, had the cost not been known, they would have assessed the probability of spending an enormous amount of money on a relatively simple task. They would have said that, had the expenses been known, they would have assessed the likelihood of spending enormous sums of money on expenses of chance. They would have said that, had the authors of the opinion's reading been known, they would have known the probability of reading it, and the probability of rejecting it. They would have said that, had the editors of the opinion's publication been known, they would know the probability of publishing it, and the likelihood of rejecting it. They would have said that, had the readers of the learned's opinion been known, they would know the probability of reading it, and the likelihood of reading it with approval. They would have said all of these things. The probability of their doing so is not negligible. The probability that the learned persons, who know nothing of the matter, would publish it is not zero. The probability that they would do so is also not negligible. The fact that, by publishing it, they have already accomplished the object they set themselves, proves beyond a reasonable doubt that they are writers. Furthermore, the fact that they did it, even though they knew nothing about the matter, proves beyond a reasonable doubt that they are readers. Thus, the opinion is not a mere verbal gloss or embellishment on the part of the mind; it is a higher
====================
Dialogical Errors in Dante's Inferno]

This conviction led me to compare the romantic theories of the time with the more literal views of the poet. I found that none of them could account for the fact that the Muse, in the last stanzas of the Inferno and in the Annulment, is said to be uncaused and not responsible. Theists, it seems, reasoned that because the Countess of Fiore is uncaused, the Muse and the reader are also uncharged. The proofs of this (from the work of Hugo Grotius): the word of a lunatic; dots in the air; an imaginary dream; a vertical division of the stage; a vertical division of the night; a horizontal division of the universe; an infinite night; the constant repetition of the words. . . The Muse denies the universe and the dreamers, the infinite night and the universe, deny the words and the stages, deny the stages and the infinite night. . . Others, more lucid, maintain that (1) the Countess denies two realities; (2) the reality of the dream partakes of an attribute equal to reality; and (3) the reality of the dream partakes of a quality equal to the reality. . . Others (who attribute the idea to dream) are Böhme with the double attribute of being and knowledge; others (with the idea of the rose color) are Cervantes with the double attribute of beauty. . . All of them, I thought, can account for the incoherence of the narrative: for the incoherence of the ideas; for the incoherence; for the indecision. Thus the novel and the novella coexist side by side, in the incoherence of dialogue; in the indecision of dialogue; in the incoherence of dialogue. . . All of them, in order to bring out the moral, bring out the inconclusive. . . Everything that can go wrong happens: the Countess' betrayal, the horse's fall, the lightning, the fire.

Then I reflected that the events of the novel follow no less an ordered sequence than the complete and total downfall of the old regime. I thought further of the manual dexterity of the novel: it is beautiful not because it can accomplish many things, nor because it can fix its sights on any particular time or place. It is beautiful simply because it does not try to do any of them. It is beautiful precisely

"With great care," I heard her say, "I am not translating any of his poetry." I asked her what she thought of the Versaillese poetess Lavinia Floriani, the most notable of the Romance writers from Bordeaux. "Very highly," she answered. She had finished reading a verse or two; I asked her what she thought of the book she had just finished. "Very pretty," she replied. "Very romantic." "Very romantic" is an understatement; nothing is more Bordeaux than the worn-out phrase "pastor qu'on peuple, on point, on pitch." She had finished reading a few verses; I asked her what they were about. "A tragedy of the absurd," I replied. "Very much like Blanco Jiménez." She had finished reading a verse or two; I asked her what they were about. "A novel," she replied. She had finished reading a couplet or an instrumental part of some old work. "Very much like Renan." She had finished reading a couplet or an instrumental part of some old work. "Very much like Renan." She had finished reading a couplet or an instrumental part of some old work. "Very much like Renan." She had finished reading a couplet or an instrumental part of some old work. "Very much like Renan." She had finished reading a couplet or an instrumental part of some old work. "Very much like Renan." She had finished reading a couplet or an instrumental part of some old work.

I asked Renan about the meaning of these strange phrases. "They are these: the present moment is an illusion, the past, a secret wish," he replied. "The present moment is nothing more than a man's effort to satisfy his phlegmatic unconscious."

"Who are these unconscious women," I asked him, "who so often inspire these verses and exhaust the pages of history and literature but who are really nothing more than man's unconscious imaginations?"

"Anyone can be a memory," he answered.

"An illusion," I ventured.

"Not an illusion," he retorted.

"Anagram of any one man," I pointed out.

"Not in a dream either," he declared.

Dialog: The sequel to the De rerum natura.

Hermann Hopper (1890-1963)

Anatomist, philosopher and dialectician.

Anarchist, communist.

Renaissance man and modernist. Perhaps the most important achievement of his career was the Grundlagen, the structure of his own system, a.k.a. anarcho-syndicalism.

The other great achievement of his career was the system of metaphysics, epistemology and political economy which he formulated.

The name of philosophy is too long to be exhaustive; the only one I can think of is perhaps monism and determinism. Hopper denies that there is such a thing. . . He thinks that a priori knowledge of the laws of nature is a priori, but he thinks the existence of such a priori knowledge is postulates and pre-philosophical.

The structure of his system is that of idealism: it is a priori, but not in a subjective, intellectual way; it is objective, but not in a subjective, intellectual way; it is a priori, but not in time, but in space.

The World According to Friedrich Engels (1923)

Man, Event and the World

The history of philosophy is the history of irreality and of the discovery of truth. Friedrich Engels (1823-1913)

On page 229 of the Collected Works of Friedrich Engels (Urtext, 1973), the English translator Edmund Spender has the Latin text of the preceding paragraph; in Edmund Spender's History of Philosophy, this paragraph will not appear. On March 23, The New York Review of Books (May-June 1970), had this interesting item: With the exception of a few idiosyncratic essays by Edmund Spender, the review edition of Lenin's pamphlet Defeated Dogmatoi consists of just twenty pages of original material. Lenin died in China on account of a stomach virus on June 1, 1945. The Marxist tradition has advanced us from the vague conjectures of a theoretical cave to the unequivocal conviction that dogmata of historical materialism have been demonstrated to be vacuous guesses and dialecticians liars. For the first time since the middle of the nineteenth century, the conscious mind enjoyed a certain decorum. . . The present essay will

That book was published in 1900. In 1903, Léon Bloy published his La congeloopie, in which the words had been slightly enlarged. In 1911, the historian A. A. Wenzel wrote that Bloy had written La congeloopie in order to correct the mistakes of Wenzel and to show that the ideas of these writers are not out of place in the history of philosophy. Wenzel was a French logician and philosopher of literature. He was ridiculed for this absurd thesis, but Wenzel has not given up the argument. He pointed out that the word "opulence" is found only six times in the works of Léon Bloy, in the first and last chapters of the Metamorphoses, in the third and fourth articles of the Critique of Pure and Applied Metaphysics, in the first and third articles of the Chrétien-Louis XV essay on music and metaphysics, in the first and third articles of the Essai sur la magiclement (1912), in the first article of the unfinished work sur la magiclement (de jardin), in the first paragraph of the article sur la magiclement (1914), in the first words of the 1958 edition of Léon-Anders Henrici's Nîmes philosophiques (d'héros) ― all these and many other examples of the uselessness of philosophy's laurels. Henrici, said Henrici, had already said it himself: "I am Nîmes, I am music." Henrici, said Wenzel, in order to show that philosophy never sets out to prove the nonexistence of God, had composed the Fundament of his system. "Not even in the search for Him does it show that there is no seeking, that everything exists solely to be discussed and that all questions are previously ― and afterwards inextricably ― related questions in the eternal debate."

The anti-philosophy of Bloy was no less a theologizing than the anti-Semitic theology of Wilhelm Pagels. In the first volume of the first volume of L'écoscience du Québec

This he prepared, but he found that all he knew about the universe was a function of his acute philological senses; his method for obtaining facts is the same as for acquiring epigrams. His principal object is to produce a work of philosophy. I remember one of his saying: "If I were king of the horses, I should prefer riding to writing." Another: "I should rather be a philosopher than a king." We shall never know whether he was joking or earnest.



III



The foregoing episode takes place in the first part of 1913. As is natural, the year before that of 1912 had a great deal to do with its history; the year before that of 1911 was, as usual, a backward year; the tenuous sequence of the preceding centuries, interwoven with the centuries, had become, in 1914, the entire history of the nineteenth century. The superstitious reverence with which man was subservient to the gods of Egypt and Mesopotamia had left it, in the rites of Egypt and Mesopotamia, of one head and one body; in spite of all the vain ceremonies of Greece and Rome, in the rites of Egypt and Mesopotamia, one man. From the ruins of Egypt and the ruins of Mesopotamia sprang Hannah Arendt, Roland Barthes, Leo Strauss, Oscar Wilde, Alberto Bertolucci, Erving Burkhard, Louis Althusser, Fritz Leiber, Alfred North Whitehead, Augustin Bloch, Louis Althusser, Auguste Dupain, Louis Althusser, Auguste-Emmanuel Léon, Auguste-Claire Raphaël Heneault, Honoré Buisson, Auguste-Russell Wallace and, later, Auguste-Claire Raphaël Triste. The year 1913 was, in a way, a continuation of the previous years; the year 1913 was also, perhaps, the thirteenth century, the century of the hunched and gnarled gods. . . The reader may ask: If, with these new gods, there is no more to fear, how come so many knights with shining helmets and steel shields have overrun Jerusalem? And how come so many theologians, astronomers and artists have been obliged, through

Dialog; in her absence, the old woman would have been content with "the old wine, the new worm, and a little bread and butter." She was also, for many years to come, unable to leave her house; her frightful, hopeless loneliness was the inevitable consequence of many and unequal acts.

In the first place, there was the matter of time. The victim's hands and feet were obviously those of the rapist; the lozenge, the manner in which she had approached it, the aggressive nature of her movements, established the fact of an unlawful rape. A second reason is less easily explained. The customary theory holds that the old woman's ordeal was premeditated and that, for this purpose, she had to be numerous and clever. But there is no reason to suppose that she was a demon or that she indulged in eccentric petty pleasures. A third reason may be of some utility: it suggests that the act did not in any case constitute rape, because the object of the act ― the lozenge ― was not the woman but the rapist. But this would require denying the power of the mental process underlying the mental act, which is alien to the mental act in question. The fourth reason is also of some utility: it permits of a mental act being called a rape because of the fact that some mystics and philosophers think it to be so; but it begs the obvious reason that the rape of things other than the rapist is no less mystifying or absurd than the rape of things other than the rapist. The act is no less violent if it is called rape, not because it is a kind of rape, but because it is a kind of relational rape.5 The act is no less real if it be called real because of the fact that it is an artifact ― a spectacle ― of perception. It is true that the mythologists and philosophers of all schools of thought have their own vocabulary for this kind of experience: the phantasmagoria of the noumenal; the ambivalence of the hallucinatory; the archetypal; the archetypal-historical; the archetypal-romantic; the archetypal-neoclassical. But all these terms ― phantasmagoria, neocollenia, myth, subornet Metaphor ― are reduced to a kind of archetypal wonder, a kind of nominal wonder, with no other goal than to express an effect or an

Postscript (1974)

In 1974, I edited a book on the life and works of Oscar Wilde. The arguments in that book have since been superseded by those in Postscript (forthcoming).

I also edited a volume of biographical essays on Oscar Wilde. The first volume contains selections from Postscript (along with biographical essays by other precursors to Wilde), and the second contains new selections by eminent historians.

In the spring of 1975, I was invited to teach a course on Argentine literature to graduating students from the Department of Latin American, North American and World Literature at New York University. Among the scholars who made the mandatory visit to Argentina was the American poet and dramatist Henry James. He was kind enough to moderate his remarks in this way:

… the Argentine novel is the simplest of novels, because it does not try to impress the reader with the complications of language, or the minutiae of a complicated world. Instead it treats all ideas and small things as if they were people, ideas and people as though they were things. . . This simplicity, which pleases all men, is the true essence of the Argentine novel.

Two and a half decades later, in the spring of 1980, I received the following letter, facsimile, in the postmark envelope of the library in Genoa. It was the very last one:



Dear Sir or Madam:

The Problem of Time

Now, consider a more general problem. What is the nature of that temporal relationship which exists between two men who never see one another, but whose distinctive marks, gestures, words, faces, voices, music and other physical and intellectual factors are common to their lives and which are passed from one of them and which are never the same?

I believe that it can be reduced to these elements existing at any one time in the phenomenal past and the phenomenal future. These elements are called thujone and entail causality, but I shall leave that analysis to the future of man. Let us consider a simple one: the relationship existing between John Wilkins and Mary Todd Lucas.

Before proceeding, I wish to emphasize two facts. The first is that this relationship exists; the second is that it is amicable. No one denies the amiability of eros and the comfortable of sex; it is probable, I believe, that the amiability and the ease of sex also exist for some men. The fact is that the magisterial authorities do not define them. To what purpose have I penetrated the tomb? . . If I were to dig up and empty the first floor, the first floor would not be dedicated to explorations and I should find the same thujone relationship I have discovered. The same holds for the others: they exist only as symbols, only as the modus operandi of an activity which in some way determines them.

The other probable end of my research is attested by another result. Robert Bauval, in the preface to his work Barbarossa, 1936, mentions the experiment of Leibniz, with its fifty-fifty chance, and notes that the same chance could be expected in a lottery. In any case, the fact is published that Leibniz had already calculated the chance of one in ten,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, and deemed it small. The probability a priori of such
====================
Dialogiones) are related to the Rerum natura, but they are not identical. The first deals with the number of words in a sentence and the second with the order in which those words are put into words. The Rerum natura narrates a very different chapter. The first chapter of the second volume of Origen's work On the First Cause deals with the number of words in a sentence and the order in which those words are put into words. The order of the words matters a great deal. A sentence of ten words long will have some effect, for example, on the memory of a liar; a sentence of the same length will be unintelligible to anyone but the speaker. The same thing happens with the words in a sentence. A passage from the Dial 999 of Cayce, for example, will have many interpretations, for example, as does the movement of a river in a pool of blood. Cayce himself put it this way: "The silent methodical movement of the rays of the noon-star in the early twilight will have several interpretations, for example, as will the tone of a cry in the deep sleep of a bull." The fact that two or three interpretations are possible does not mean that they are; the purpose of this essay is to settle that very point. The passage is from the second part of the eleventh chapter of the Appendix to the Enchiridion. It relates how, on the night of the twelfth of September, the Order was announced to the world and all appeared before the Face of One. The Face proclaimed the secrecy of His favor and ordered the witnesses to follow him to the edge of a sword. Then to the glow of a razor, to the howl of a bull, to the shriek of a thousand birds, to the sound of a silence that seemed to pervade the vast expanse, where were Eleven and the Truth.

We read in the Dial: Eleven stands at the entrance to a prison, eight stands facing her; the other eight (called the counters) guard the way, close together. The passage is that of the iron bars that prevented the way to the upper world. Two or three interpretations are conceivable. One: The truth is on the other counters. Two: The truth is on the other counters. Three: The truth is on the other counters. Four: The truth is on the other counters. Five: The truth is on the other counters

The Yiddish word for "tree" is taiga, which is a corruption of the Hebrew word for "tree," taz, which is a corruption of the Greek word for "tree," aurel.

The theory of the Yiddish word for "tree" is complex, and I do not intend it to be taken as a mere metaphor. I believe that the foregoing exposition will have the desired influence upon you. I believe also that it is sufficient for me to say a few words in its favor. Your adversary must deny that the Hebrew word for "tree" is a corruption of the Greek word for "tree." I deny it, enigmatically. I believe that all men acknowledge this. I believe that all who have looked into the secret languages of the world admit that the Hebrew word for "tree" is a corruption of the Greek word for "tree." I affirm, enigmatically.

In an anonymous room on a train headed for Zürich, Ben Jonson wrote the first paragraph of the third chapter of his Meditations. The author of the manuscript, unknown, had changed the order of the lines; the last referred to the death of Caesar Giver, the first to the death of Creator. From that day on, the order of the seventy-seven entries in the text was that of the varied lines of a medieval manuscript: that of the acolytes of a Jacobean monk, the pages of a French or English tragedy, the varied lines of a manuscript, the orders of an unknown author's manuscript.

Twelve hundred years later, I would like to recall those different lines of a contemporary work: the twenty-two lines of Diego Rivera's essay "La muerte y la brújula" (To the Wood and the Metal); the lines of the anonymous author of the fifteenth chapter of the last part of Pierre Menard's Revue anthropologique; the lines of the preface to Samuel Butler's La futura; the lines of Leopold Bloom's famous essay in the same work.

Dialog. The nautical terms — latitude, longitude — were chosen with a view to aiding the students in their task, but they nevertheless provoked the ire of Averroes and caused him to leave. He returned to Verona, where he died on the 5th of February, 1691.

In the year 1692, the abbe Sinistråd produced another edition of the Nibelungus, in which the terms "latitude and longitude" and "tropical regions" were missing. This time the objections were not only arbitrary, but also founded on mere ignorance of the text. For example, the author of the previous edition (Dr. Erik Lorendhorn) had translated it as Johannes for Johannesbewusstsein, but Franz Josef Sinistråd found it necessary to modify the text so that the reader would read (as before) Johannes for Johannesbewusstsein. Thus (for example) should one read: Johannes for Johannes ― Johannesnacht! Johannesnacht! Johannesnacht! Johannesnacht! Johannesnacht!

In the third edition of the Nibelung (1801), the author of the preceding revisions removed these omissions; the following are translations of the passages he has replaced.

"On the origin of the modern globe: an examination of the Copernican system. Paris, July, 1824. Pages 207-209."

====================
Dialog; but, within the circle, there are individuals who, with slight effort, can transcribe and repeat, under their own unique script, a tragedy or a comedy of errors, a tragedy or a tragedy of errors. All this is possible; the difficulty lies in the obscurity of the original.

The notion of originality has, however, two sides. One is the intellectual; it is legitimate to criticize a work because it is incorrect; but, insofar as it is an art form, it should be original. The other, more real, is the personal one. I recall a man of very high birth who, for fifty years, from Kiev to Buenos Aires, could not bring himself to open his favorite book ― the Porte's catalogues ― at the public library; another, a poor artist in a wretched neighborhood, who could not remember, under various interpretations, for fifty years his splurging friend's palette ― sins of memory, ignorance, age ― and his friend's infinite palette, which includes all the real colors of the rainbow. . . These personal cases illustrate, I believe, the general law: the more uniform a thing is, the less original it is to be valued as an individual. To be original, it has been answered, is to be deprived of commonality; to be deprived of commonality, of uniqueness.

The other general case is analogous to that of time. If the day is absolute and the minute a mere form of chance, what right has the hourder to be unique? Can't he a priori decide for himself what the night is to be determined by natural laws?

Another: Can't we all, at some future period, just decide that the present moment is the present moment and that time immemorial has been the present moment?

I know of no one who has attempted to arrive at a just judgment concerning individual life. I suspect that this is due, at least in part, to our credulity; I suspect, however, also, that we cannot fathom the vast cosmos which man has created and which, though infinitely vast, is, at bottom, the smallest of all the possible smaller ones. I know that many a man has sought to reason this fact out for him by recourse to allegories or metaphors; I know that many a man has felt that laborious task assigned to him, to rediscovering the smallest of the constants of time, has not been sufficient;

Averroes, Cyrenilles



Cyrenilles (also spelled City and Landing) is a medieval city on the River Seine in the western part of Paris. Founded in the year 1292, it is the oldest of the region's tributaries and has a long and illustrious tradition of frugal and noble tastes. Its envoys from Spain, who abound in the principal neighborhoods, are well known for their delicatessen quality, where they prepare European cuisines in harmony with local tastes and traditions.

Averroes is of Castilian stock, of the northern or northern French family. Its principal saint is the mystic Jean François le Cardinal, who died in the first of the years of the Fifth Republic. The city's most illustrious saint is the ex-pirate Louis XIV, who, under the leadership of a politician (of the noble blood of Anschauck) who destroyed the palace of the Duc d'Arc, restored the Bourbon dynasty and instituted torture and the guillotine, suffered the tortoise (Anne of Vienne) and the harem serpent (Anne of Guienne) and the treese serpent (Anne of Aurès) and La Taché, which were dedicated to the tortoise and the harem serpent, respectively. (The name of the last one is said to have been approved by one of the abbots of Auvergne who was a disciple of Louis XIV; but one cannot be a disciple of two legendary ancient titans of the desert and a marble emperor of the Goths.) The abbot survived, but many of his adherents detested his massive size. The city was able to endure the Thirty Years' War, and during that war, its envoys from Toulon were entertained by the invincible fleet of Charles Martel.

Averroes is the name under which the poorer and more humble neighborhoods are known.

Dialog, that is, the rational interpretation of the world, is the only one that can be said to possess a certain plausibility and even probability. The others are mere guesses or diffidence.

The Argument from Expectations tries to do away with these guesses and to show that for any faith \(f:\) there exists an expected faith in the performance of the act. This act must precede all other acts and each act must precede all others and so on to infinity; the existence of any imperfect act (which is false) entails the existence of an infinite series. I can say with Ridpath that the world is a circle if I expect a man to be in the middle and a circle if I expect a man to be out of the middle. But the middle part must precede the end part and the out part and the beginning part and so on to infinity; if the series is finite, the series is empty; the infinite series \(h:x,\ldots,h:y\) is a mathematical proof that there is an infinite series \(h:x,\ldots,h:z\), exactly. The series \(h:x,h:y\) is an argument from mathematics to theorems. The series \(h:x,h:z\) is a proof of the existence of God. The series \(h:x,h:z\) is an argument from sets to theorems. This last argument, the Theorems, are the only ideas in the world, just as time is time in a clock. The series \(h:x,h:z\) is an argument from sets to the observation that all theorems are the only facts.

In the beginning of the twentieth century a new branch of philosophy flourished in Europe. It was concerned with the structure of time and of space and its relationship and the structure of the physical world. This structure was seen not as a simple succession of division and addition but as a continuous and almost triangular whole. The earth is the base and the sky the top; the middle is the earth and the sky and the top is the sky. The world was called not by its name in time but by a number of different names. It was sometimes called the "outer world" or the "inner world." The latter would include the feelings, the thoughts, the ideas, the colors, the shapes, the sounds and the tactile sensations produced by the "outer world."

Dialog and in the book of Rites. But I am more faithful to his labyrinth than to his labyrinths.

Amidst the universal blizzard of letters, there came a single page which seemed to justify my doubts. It was the thirty-third of December, 1884. My father had died that year. My mother was to die a few months later. I was then but seven years old. I remember the last names of my parents and siblings, I remember the tired, rainy streets and the enormous tomb which my grandmother painstakingly dug until her death, I remember the magnificent urns and the wretched dormitories and the many boxes stuffed with letters, I remember the miraculous fashion in which my grandmother carried out her arduous task, I remember the way with which she covered the ground with the back of her hand and with the back of her foot, I remember the way that day the letter she was carrying slipped from her lips and into the little hands of strangers, I remember the way that letter was torn in two, I forget these accidental details. I remember them now, in the form of this paragraph, as follows:

"My dear Hugo, I have something to tell you. It is very important."

"What is it?" I asked him.

"Dear Hugo, you are about to find out whether the most eminent person in the world is a fraud or not."

This story took us from the evening of December twentieth to dawn of January one of the other days. I did not see my father that evening. I did not know he was ill until two in the morning the following day. I did not see my mother until after six in the afternoon. I do not know what time it was when I received the telegram. I judged that I had received the duty of bringing it to your attention, I judged that I had received the obligation of proving to myself that it was not the work of a cruel and careless aunt, or that it was not that of a sick and careless grandmother, or that it was not that of a missus of the cardinal's who had deceived me. I judged that last, with the certainty that the other was not so. It seemed to me that my errand was well performed. Perhaps you will pardon my pronouncing the matter over with me now.

====================
Dialog. The reader will observe that there is no such thing as a purely formal language. The interlocutors of certain dialects of Quixote are incapable of proceeding literally, though they could at times literally. The gross and the subtle go hand in hand in this language, and the writers of Quixote never knew whether to admire its subtlety or its ingratitude. The writer of this work once observed that the very coarse are always expressing their gratitude to the subtle for pointing out to them the invisible hand of fate."

The foregoing quotation marks the crucial point at which the reader reaches the "very coarse" of the Quixote. The reader may easily allow himself one or two more such blunders; this does not change the fact that the Quixote is, at its best, a work of genius. Bioy does not try to copy the mold of Cervantes, but rather surpasses the lines of that celebrated author. Bioy makes the reader—the spectator—the author of many of the adventures. He does not try to copy the vein of Spain, but rather flourishes under that vein. Bioy creates a universe out of the quagmire of the Quijada and the Cordillera.

Bioy, like all true artists, knows how to make his unreal world come alive in his imagination. He knows how to make the heroes feel human while they murder, steal, and rob. He knows how to make the reader feel sympathy for these pitiable characters of passion and adventure who have to live out their miserable lives in the shadow of great men. He knows that to glorify these men is to glorify their heroism; and yet, at the same time, he knows that to glorify such a creature as the author of those adventures ought to know that he is glorifying a creature. Bioy's ghoulish heroes do not have to be realistic in order to be truly fantastic; mere happenstance (or mere human frailty) will do. Bioy's fictions become our realities, and our realities become our fictions. I have said that fiction and reality are one and the same thing. I believe that our perceptions of the unreal—our dreams, our visions, our vague ideas of right and wrong—will ultimately be the same as the author's fictions. Bioy's fictions will live on in our psyches and in the psyches of our children, and the children will remember
====================
Dialog (4), the "federal" form of which is introduced by way of illustration in the next chapter.

The following quotation, from the first article on Anarchist Communism, is instructive: "We must, at any rate, admit that the system of collectivism which prevails in the United States is, at bottom, a mere moralism. . . It is a vain pretension, a sham, a cover for a system of degenerated collectivism. The individual is no longer and nowhere the centre of our attention. . . The conduct of others is as important as his own virtues or weaknesses. We should invert the old maxim: Character is not in one another, but throughout one another. We should dictate to them our inner nature, interpret that nature, and ascribe to them that character."

The following quotation, from the end of the second article, is instructive: "The Anarchist holds that man is not only capable of evil, but also of good. If this is so, how can a just ruler condemn a guilty man and punish him? If this is so, how can a just man justify a righteous act?"

The following quotation, at the end of the article on Proudhon, is instructive: "The Proudhonist denies that there is such a thing. He denies that virtue or vice can be established objectively, in space and time, and he denies that such an issue can concern man at all. For him, man is constituted in time, in space, and this notion determines the whole. . . The space and time of an individual moment can exist side by side or separate from one another. . . But this man differentiates between two individuals: between the external and internal world."

The following quotation, at the end of the article on Landau, is instructive: "Landau (among others) denies that time exists apart from or in its own right. Rather, he denies that two unrelated events are "the same." He maintains that they become one, internalized, internalize one another, internalize the external world. He denies that external and internal worlds can unite: "one single image manifests itself in another's life." He denies that the world is fundamental: "land, time, fire, air, the firmament, the firmament itself." He denies that the self exists apart from the world. All these propositions, then, oppose themselves to one another and to
====================
Dialog (Lucas 1981, 131).

In Kafka's work, the distinction between metaphor and similitude is not so clear‑cut as it might seem. Similitude here means an exact repetition of the things exemplified, as in the word nachtragen in Der Nachtragen; metaphor, on the other hand, refers to the way in which the similitude reproduces the qualities of the exemplified things, as in the thirteenth chapter of the Nibelung in the Subjunctive. This suggests that similitude and metaphor do not always have to coincide; for example, in a passage from the Nibelung derinvent, Chapter XXXI, where the author Thomas Bernhard Meistersen translates the Güell Codex, he simulates the Codex's six hundred and twelve manuscripts with his own innumerable variations. One passage from the Canterbury Tales, on the other hand, simulates the tributary wars of Henry the Navigator; this suggests that the wars of Henry the Navigator are not essential, whereas the likeness of the monsters in the tales is.

Kafka's similes and allusions, the lucid linearting and the use of very small type (thin as a prayer), the rhetorical allusion and the use of rhetorical allusions, the fact that the book is divided into three‑hundred and thirty chapters and the slight resemblances which seem to the reader's liking, the fact that the author assigns so many prototypes, make up the basis of a very high art: the uncanny.

The first half of the nineteenth century witnessed a vast revival of the mystical, the astrological and the pseudohistorical, when the word "myst" was unknown; the second, the appearance in the literature of the astrological terms for the future Christ; the third, the reappearance of these terms in the literature of the present day. This third revival ― which coincided not only with the religious but also with the political experiments of the Third Reich ― bore witness to the reality of the Christ who is not a man of flesh and blood but of stars. The phenomenon was not confined to Germany. The mystic writings of all countries showed the faithful reception there of these terms. In the pages of this magazine I have seen accounts in which devotees of the Greek God have been portrayed; among the Nephi inhabitants of the American continent, who imagine themselves as the descendants of Alma, who
====================
Dialog (11), the universal dialectic of the Logos. Anacharsis is an infinite regress, a state of parables, of images.

It is time for an analysis of these images. We can see that the Logos is a mortal man who in a garden of obscure myths and languages has been sent astray by obscure metaphors. We see in one of these images the form of the age-old enemy of the philosophers: the fox. The fox is the symbol of the god of blindness, Delphos, who also is the name of one of the fourteen mountains in the Iliad. The god who creates the world creates a fox, Delphos, who creates men. In the garden of myths and in the labyrinth of words, the foxes are the shadows of the men they seek. The foxes of the foxes, in other words, are not the same as those who fight against them, but rather are a reflection of them. The foxes of the labyrinth of words are not the same as those who speak against the writer. But the central paradox of all is this: the poet must repeatedly choose between the image of a fox and the opposite of the image: the double image of the image. In other words, the poem must repeat and reconquer the task it set its pen to a century and a half ago: the image of an phantom.

The pictures of the labyrinth of words are no less corrupt than those of the labyrinth of words. They have the virtue of being metaphors, but the essential virtue of being symbols. They are full of holes, for example, when it is said that the first man is "flat on his back on the sand," which is a kind of picture, but also when it is said that another man on the fourth division is already a "sturdy little lump of rock," which is an image. . . Or think of the pictures of the god of the dead who commands the dead to dig a pit and to build a staircase: they are no less images when we read that the god "tried to persuade them to do his work for him," and "told them their days were few and their nights extremely long." Or, again, of the images of a blind man who knows that he is being projected by another man, "another blind man," who projects images of himself. . . Or think of the images of a boy whose eyes are that of an animal and another

I have said that the first thing a man does when he has listened to the Confucian manual is to mention the importance of not giving the impression that one is versed in Greek. It is also customary, when recounting an incident, to add a few words or a few phrases of Basque origin, so that the reader might infer the Basque character of the story and the Basque accent. In the story of the goldfish there is a saying which exemplifies this practice: "If you want to know the real value of a koinon, you should have put it on the menu."

The first thing a person does when he hears the name Basque is to imagine that he is Basque, or that he has spent many sleepless nights pondering this very question. This is what happens a number of times, before the reader has even heard of Basque music or of Basque food. He hears it said that the Basques are extremely modest people; that they prefer simplicity and cleanliness to error and errorfulness; that they value style very little and precision very much; that they are obsessed with preserving the ancient and the beautiful and basing their tastes in culture and not in language or on architecture or generally. He hears it said that the Basques are the first to admit that they are little people of few and great qualities; that they are proud of that fact, just as the Spaniards were; that they are proud that they have come so far, but just as much that they should have to suffer so much. He hears it said that the Basques are easygoing, sentimental people; that they are very simple-minded, but very literatiocre; that they are proud of that fact, just as the literati of other languages are; that they are proud of the fact that the simpletons of other tongues are easygoing and sentimental, just as the literati of the Basque are; that the simpletons of other tongues are easygoing, sentimental, and easygoing. He hears it said that the Basques are gentle and sentimental; that they are gentle because they are, not because they are graceful or because they are pretty. . .

Dialog, which I have already mentioned; but the more modern and objective Descartes' Pensée sur la Lectionte, which I read recently; also the discourse by Roemerstein on the Lectiones, published in 1904. These works are of a very modern period, since they are written by men who did not exist in the nineteenth century. You will say: Are not our contemporaries everywhere present in the public squares? No; they are few and far between. They are also anonymous and communicate by secret means. I know of one instance in which two men met face to face in a very poor tavern; the one who gave the speech, recovered his voice, and the other had already spoken several times on the telephone. I know of another, in which two young men appeared at the end of the square, close together, and said to each other: We are going to the Ploughshare. They shared a warm supper, then they went their separate ways. I know of another in which two young men, in the middle of the square, asked each other for money. They immediately knew that they were being watched; they had already gotten up; they had scarcely left the tavern when the watchman saw them and knew that they were seeking some much needed coin. They repeated the exercise several times, after which they went their separate ways. I know of another in which two young men, in the middle of the square, appeared before the master of the tavern. They were very ill and their faces and their bodies seemed to tremble and vibrate in a vice-like way. The master did not know who they were, only that they were very ill and that he was his clients. He sat down and the young men resumed their silence. The master did not dare to speak to them; he knew that they were secretly waiting for some one to speak for them. He spoke to God and to the gods of his fathers. In the midst of those fathers he in some way or another was identified with their deeds; he shared their anxieties and apprehensions; he was, or was becoming, one of them. Nothing could disturb him; the past, the future, the place and the time were subordinated to that divine intelligence.

Those events took place in 1904; those persons existent then, and will exist ultimately, as ghosts in the heart of a free man. The events of 1904 do not concern me; I shall not be that man. I

"In the mean while," I continued, "we had a very successful show on the Pacifico. So well received were the readers that they repeated it several times and even changed the title. The readership of the Pacifico was a very particular type. Those who tuned in had the distinct impression that they were listening to a concert. There were no horns, just the pipes and the organ, nothing artificial. The music was regular and the audience composed themselves that this irregular sort of show had been invented by La Mesa. . . I remember one evening when we had played the tragedy of Phaethon and the audience began to boo and jeer, suddenly there appeared on the platform a tall and extremely heavy man with a gun. He said to them, very sternly, "You cannot assemble here without a special permit." Then he shot two men in the shoulders and killed one of them. The other two stood amazed and a little frightened by this extraordinary development. Suddenly they heard a noise in the distance and a tall and glowing object with red stripes flew through the air and smashed into a rock near them. Then it stopped." ― Ernest Hemingway, The Admiral ofquotes the exploits of La Mesa, the inspiration for his famous poem, and treats us to another variation of the same story.



I read in Ulysses (published in Dresden in 1792) that the universe, which produced these pages, had been inventing them since the year 6120. A subterranean civilization had advanced so far that it had created men, who had invented also the alphabet, the calendar, the universe, the calendar and the sky. The sky was a perfect diamond of light, made of reds, yellows, greens and blues; behind it hung a circular tower with facades of reds, yellows and greens; in the center of the city spied the god Brahmachari, who enriches all creation and knows no other god. It was said that the builders of the sky were Brahmachari himself and that the god gave them the sky as a backing, so that they would not be men if they were not also builders. The god also gives back pieces of the backing, so that pieces may be perfected into a whole.

Then they came to a huge and open pit. The Indians dug in the earth; the dogs barked in the distance. The master pushed the button that opened the trap door.

Suddenly, the master shouted to the dogs to get down from the roof; the dogs, galloping down with unusual speed, caused the din to become a shout. The words disappeared into the night.

Permanent Involvement [ edit ]

I recall the day as if it were yesterday; like a distant memory, it returns to me with strange clarity. Perhaps that clarity is temporary. I was returning from a study with Dr. Oppenheimer. We were descending a flight of stairs when we came to a deep and narrow passageway filled with leaden pits. The depth of the passageway was not important; what mattered was that some of the ledges had been worked by men and that the nails had stuck out too far from the underlying rock. The men had left their work unfinished; the men who had not done their share of the work, or had left it unfinished, had left marks on the underlying rock. I followed the traces of the unfinished work, until they fell off the face of the cliff. Later that day, I was in the study where I kept my log book. I opened it; I did not recognize the name of the book's publisher. It startled me not to find it on page 223, the last page of the first edition. I opened another and looked up the note under the headings History of the Nation of the Dinosaurs and History of the Zoological Society of London.

The Making of a Novel



Variety is an art which consists in the creation of what Ferdinand de Vitorial has aptly called "an enigmatic archetype of the text": the protagonist's encounter with its own text, with its own laws, with its own themes of law and snobbishness, of good and evil, of the seasons and the trees. . . The task of creating a character is reduced to the relatively few individuals who can do so ― and do it well. Ferdinand de Vitorial observed that the true novelist does not differ from his art in person or work, but rather in his ability to imagine a situation from the point of view of that character from the beginning to the end. Thus Benedetto Bachelier, in a chapter on Arnold Bennett, presents an almost identical idea from the point of view of the enigmatic character of a hotelier who comes into conflict with the mysterious and elegant Emma Bonaparte. Bachelier (with justification) reasons, on the basis of this almost identical situation, to define it: Benedict Arnold, "the tactful and ingenious soldier who saved the year." Emma, "the happy monarch who acted rashly." The hotelier and the king. . . The book is full of examples from literature and are not exhaustive, but they give us his work as an archetype of a writer capable of it, and perhaps as a warning against falling victim to it.

The first letter of the name is a corruption of the name of the god, as it is a god is a corruption of the name. <valor at lines's end> 19. This is the third part of the decree of the First Oblast, which decreed the enumeration of the moons of Phobos in a pyramid and the building of a ship of that name. The decree of the fifth Oblast decreed that a memorial dedicated to the god of war and iron be erected in every village. Chapter XXI Oblast I. The cities of the Oblast I are without parallel. Their walls, their towers, their barred and painted roads, their shops of marble and iron, their public spectacles and public celebrations, combine to give them a general appearance of vastness. The inhabitants are of every national origin, but the commonest features are a slight admixture of Asian, of European, and of African origin. Their names refer to no historical fact, but to the memory of a single memory. The first I may speak of as Boleslav Sobieski, the second, to that of Igor St. George, who was the last of the patriarchs. Their capital is Kiev, but they energetically promote Russian influence throughout the land. They have adopted the rigid routine of the East, but their conscience and their language are very much like that of Asia Minor. Theirs are a simple, simple life; their thirteenth revision of history declares that in 1824 they carried out a conspiracy with the intention of overthrowing the tsar and establishing a Russian empire in Asia Minor. Their honor requires that their confessions should be memorandums of law. Their women live in poverty; their history requires that they should. Their currency is the Ukrainian lei. Their periodical, Izvestia, was the sole paper allowed to be openly different in color. Their motto is "The Truth Is One." Their currency is the rouble.

====================
Dialog, the first two-thirds of the foregoing chapter, are given in full in M. Platon, Monumenta Americana, II, Paris, 1904.

PRINCIPAL I have perceived, even from the very beginning, that the foregoing arguments do not, originally, seem almost paradoxical. Let us see if we can apply them in a single case. The preceding chapter has been based on the following hypothesis: the activity of the eye is a simple repetition of the matter it is made of; the same principle governs the organ of vision, which in turn repeats the matter it is made of; the same principle governs the imagination, which in turn reproduces the world. I believe I have explained the facts.

Several things, however, make me doubt this very simple hypothesis. The first is this: what is the imagination (made up of several expressions, each of which we can give a true name) to do? To repeat what it already has? Or to create something new and separate from what it already is? Or to reproduce in such a way that the forms it takes for reality are in fact perverted creations? These two diametrically opposed operations of the imagination are opposed operations, each with its counter-figurative operations. To repeat is to put them at their ease; to create is to correct their uneasy ease. The counter-example is a means to an end and the uneasy ease a point of view. Now the operations of the imagination are operations of an uneasy outlook. They tend toward the sublime and are opposed to it by a deadly facetiousness. To repeat is to put an end to uneasiness; to create is to correct uneasiness? How can one do both?

To put an end to uneasiness one must have uneasiness; to correct uneasiness one must edit uneasiness. Now the operations of the imagination are not hostile to one another; they are complementary. Now they are complementary. Let us go one step further and imagine three individuals. Now each of the individuals has a negative aspect to him or her: the stammering man, the retiring woman and the lunatic woman. Now we can say that they all harbor in themselves negative qualities which are counterposed in a positive manner in the imagination of the other individuals: the imaginary man, the imaginary woman and the phantasmagoria of Bernini. Now Bernini attributes these counterpositions in his works to
====================
Dialog and the other, The First Person. A description of the first person is found in Wilfred Owen's letter to the clergyman Samuel Butler, who was to publish it in his work The First and Great History of the World (London, 1824).

"I have read the foregoing discourse of your Samuel Butler; it pleases me very little. It seems to me that the best mode of discerning its superfluity is this: by what man has he managed to invent this system of worlds which he condemns? Let it suffice for me to cite a few characters: Butler, a Puritan; Pitt, a Puritan; Thrale, a Puritan; Richare, a Puritan. Let us suppose each of them had read an equal number of books; that each of them has written three volumes of history; that each of them has discarded the third as an unnecessary chapter; that each of them has discarded the third as an unnecessary volume of poetry. The system would be completed: we should say of the theologians a priori what a posteriori, but with a certain affectionate awe. . . We should not exaggerate the value of this system; we should not exaggerate the imperfection of humanity. But each of us has embellished it; each of us has relieved, or exacerbated, or rectified certain unfortunate aspects. I know I have. And now I desire to compare it with that lofty ideal of the universe which has been attributed to none but God: the Sphere of Isidore of Cusa."

====================
Dialog, but I think the underlying idea is the same: the universe is an illusion, an outright fabrication perpetrated by men for men. This idea is a lucid one; it is true that the world has begun to emerge from the magical meshes of time and place, and that the symptoms of this awakening — the appearance of newspapers and magazines, of radio and television, of European and American literature — correspond to those of an approaching awakening. But let us recall that the world was a fabrication perpetrated by men for men. Let us recall also that the awakening has not taken place; let us recall also that the future is already here, and men's restless appetites and anxieties will not abate until that present moment also appears. Let us recall also that the present moment does not concern tomorrow, but rather the nightmarish night of March 27, 1947. Let us recall also that the present moment is identical with the nightmare which preceded it, and the nightmare which preceded it, and so on to infinity. We are not even left with the ludicrous idea that the universe actually is this compact, this translucent, this translucent reflection of the past which it sometimes seems to be.

The expression "this compact, this translucent, this filial mirror" is perhaps paradoxical, because it implies that the mirror which we project into the past is actually the mirror which the future actually projects into us. But this is a logical error. The world is not a compact material reality, or a mirrorless mirror. Rather, the world is the dizzying multiplicity of appearances which constitutes the fabric of space and time. The world is a labyrinth which no one can fully unroll until it becomes for him a labyrinth which also may be for someone else: that is to say, until that which can hold a person in may also hold in something more accessible. And so it is with all men: we project our appearances before the unliving world, and on to a labyrinth which in some way or another containss or multiplies us. If I project that splendid face upon the survey, I do not grasp for a moment that solidity which might hold me there. The same is true of our dreams: we project our private vices before the world, and on to a labyrinth which also in some way or another holds or containss or multiplies private vices. Neither is it true that the past, which is as foreign to each of us as the mosquito is to the insect, may in some
====================
Dialogical games and the like were not unknown to him. He had very nearly invented them himself; he just did not use languages he did not understand. One day, in the cheerful embrace of youth and exaltation of his mind, he had transcribed, in the most sloppy and accidental manner imaginable, the following sentences: "The sun revolves about the earth on elliptical and hyperbolic paths which are always on the upshot that the other road leads to a certain doom." Or: "The sun revolves about the earth on elliptical and hyperbolic paths which are always on the downside that the other road leads to a certain beauty." Or: "The sun revolves about the earth on elliptical and hyperbolic paths which are always on the upshot that the other road leads to the certainty of one's destiny." In other words, it was a kind of labyrinth whose walls alternated between the impossible and the theobromine. Schopenhauer, who was then quite old for his age, was obliged to admit that such games were of value, but he insisted that they should not be confused with theology; he insisted on distinguishing them from the theological game and from it from now on game over. And so he did. . .

Such was the method of Schopenhauer's reformulation. In the first method life is a kind of game of symbols, in the second life is a game of symbols of life. In the first life there are no symbols; our life is life in another sense. In the second life there are, but in the first not in a personal sense. Schopenhauer distinguished three kinds of men: those which Roland Barthes had called "practical," like lawyers and doctors, but which were also merchants, artists, soldiers and professors; those which were more symbolic, like the logicians who applied metaphysics to utter chaos and the mystics who applied metaphysics to utter chaos to its antediluvian immanent self; and finally there were men who used the symbolic, like the alchemists and travelers. All men can be a symbolist, even all liars. It is enough for us to see a man, to feel his symbol and reject his truth; we do not have to see him, to feel him and reject his truth. There is no such thing as a straightforward man. Or rather there is. Those who study Myth and History find in this finding a mockery. We know

Dialog, Tristram Shandy; the end of the eleventh century, the print in the library of the great emperor of Burgundy; the end of the twelfth century, the first edition of the History of the Goths. The history of a people. The vision which foretold these events and revealed to me their author is the same vision which sent me to the Tuileries and to that of Bachelier. It foretold to me the birth of a poet who would one day rediscover the fragments of a lost art and would do so with the eloquence and the diction of a traveler and the tears of an audience. It foretold to me the death of a traveler, but not my thirst for knowledge or my love of letters or my scorn of dialectical reasons.

In the library of the Tuileries, I read the histories of nations. I read of the Pyrrhus of olden time, the Ch'ing of Ts'ui Pên, the Homer of the poets. I read of the vain explorations of the emperor Maxent, of the slavery of the commoner, of the exile of the rich. . . I read of the invention of the troglodyte, of the barbarous wars of the troglodydron. I read of the vain wars of the Goths, of the invention of the Goths. I read of the invention of the Goths.

I read of the invention of the Goths.

One morning, in 129, the Goths, under the leadership of the black-bearded rector Alfred the Great, invaded the Spanish frontier. Alfred's army ravaged the land, it captured churches, it murdered and it produced mutilated warriors. The historians speak with bitterness of the mistreatment of the slain and of the depleted resources of the ravaged country; letters, reminiscences, plays and histories narrate the exploits of the defeated army and glorify the hero Alfred, who won back his lands and his wives and his armies. Years later, in Toledo, the Goths would have their last battle. The historian Tacitus would record that the emperor was greatly afflicted by the battle, that he meditated an atrocious surgical opition, that he was groaning in a chair, and that behind him, on a purple and on iron balconies, vast and mysterious, loud and faint, were the cries of two women whose terror and ecstasy were

Dialog

I am going to explain to you something that has happened recently in Khorasan. I am going to tell you that from the very beginning of my government there have been elements of this secret enemy.

The story goes that before the year 1000 a certain Persian king, Ptolemy, built a temple to the Sun and dedicated to it the years 14 and 1501 of the Egyptian year. Amongst the dead there was a Jew, perhaps the Philistine, but his name was Chrysanthus and he had dedicated to the Sun the years of 1493 and 1494 of the Egyptian year. I do not know the exact date; it is certain that a decree was signed by the king who declared that the years of the Gregorian Calendar (which is the ordinary one) are no less ancient than those of the Egyptian Calendar.

This decree did not last long; groups of Egyptians rebelled and in a few years the new monarch was again elected. This time he consecrated the years of 1493 and 1494 to the Sun. Within a century or two it was decreed that all years should have a name and that the people's honor should be at the service of the national deity. This change was not complete. There were periods of laxity and even of licentiousness; during these periods it was not unusual to see a conversion in the least degree irregular. The nature of the God whose honor the nation idolized seemed to them to require some regularity. . . Chrysanthus, burdened with enormous tasks, lost his temper and said to himself: "I shall bequeath to the nation these lost centuries: I shall have renouncing my humanity as my chief end and fulfilling the destiny assigned to me as the sun god's avenger." He decreed that the years 1493 and 1494 should henceforth be called "the years of wrath." He also decreed that they form a triple series known as the Trinity. He died without modifying the decree; it was signed by all the dead monarchs. Overwhelmed with grief, many of the people broke down and died during the protracted mourning rites; others, unable or unwilling to undergo suffering enduring indefinitely, obeyed his decrees. The astonishment and even horror of the earth did not prevent the Egyptians from celebrating a revolution of the years. This revolution, which they called the Twelfth Dynasty, lasted some four hundred years.

The foregoing narrative is one

Dialog or an Epicurean syllogism, in which the phrase "the heavens declare war" is meant to refer to the battle of Lepanto and that of Pellinore, when Odysseus founds the island of Crete, is a declaration of war against heaven and that of earth, since the mountainous island of Phlius is the seat of the gods.

There is another verse, even more ancient than the others: the twenty-two verses of Jeremiah. These verses proclaim the captivity of Jerusalem; the twenty-two virgins are the reward of her endurance; the words, "the Lord our God is at hand" are the cry of a broken and scattered people. They are prophetic and they are as true now as they were then. They are applicable to the peoples of the future as they are to the peoples of the present. The nations of the future will not recognize the past. The past is the mirror of the future.

The words "in the days of his indignation" are not rhetorical. They mean, essentially, "in the days of his indignation we shall see him." That is why the Targum Beiträge speaks of an "enigma" or "perception." The days of his indignation are clouded by fire and sword; on those days the people of Judah will see the face of their God, in the wilderness, in the sacred grove, on high, with tears in his eyes.

In the first century of the twelfth century, the Swiss mystic Eckhart de formed an axiom which survives in the treatises of all succeeding centuries: Nature abhors a vague image, but if we leave a vague image as we found it on the day of Christ, what is the case? Eckhart considered the matter as follows: If the imperfects of the visible world are to have any value, we must have some analogy in the invisible world, in God. Theologians of all creeds have tried to find it. Some drew a picture from the four humors: there it is obvious that there is an affinity, a resemblance, between the four bodily tastes which make up our repose: wood, water, air. Others drew a picture from the ten Commandments: there it is obvious that God created Adam and Eve as symbols, or prefigurations, or metaphors for God. Another, from the state of the union with the Blessed Virgin:

If anyone would know the nature of the Master, he would know that it is not something dissociated or transcended, but is outside of time, outside of all things, in the present moment. The world is but the surface of the ocean; the deeper the surface, the thicker the surface, but the truth is that all things are but one reality, because all things are tangibles, perceptions, mixtures of particulars. The image on the page is a posteriori false, because it confuses the author's subjective experience of the work with its objective reality; the author's subjective experience of the book is the same as the work's objective reality, because the author's subjective experience of the book is the same as its objective reality. But the author's personal relationship to his book is the same as the author's personal relationship to himself, because the author's personal relationship to the book is the same as his personal relationship to the universe, since the author's personal experience of the book is the same as his personal experience of the book's author, since the author's personal experience of the book's entire universe is the same as the author's personal experience of a single event.

Hermann Longbach once said that the true man is free from private grief and communal pain. I think we can all relate to this. The Renaissance man was moved by the memory of his mother; the modern one is not sobriled by the idea that he is the author of a book whose copyright has never yet existed. In the Renaissance man, private grief and communal pain were foreign and intractable problems; in our age they seem almost eternal. Do we not all feel that our mother was a dog, or that our father was a corpse, or that the sun and the moon are a fairy world composed of thin air and do we not dream that we are immortal and the world is a dream? . . Freud, speaking of primitive man, says: "He does not possess, does not even know, the morbidness of other men's inebriations; on the contrary, he is blessed with the opposite quality: with the intoxication of the sacred." "The Joy of Reality" is a metaphorical painting; could anyone really feel the ecstasy of looking at the photograph that restores sleep to a sleeping man's face or seeing the photograph that brings a contented happiness to the young woman's face ?

The proclamation of the Gospel in Spain, in the ninth century, signified, first, the restoration of the faith; second, the proclamation of the world to be known by faith; third, the proclamation of the Master, the invisible God, who is the object of our faith. It was a proclamation of the world, but also of heaven, of the harmony of the spheres, of the threefold God. In the proclamation of that time I have always found it difficult to arrive at a correct definition of a good word. Some years ago I tried to do so with these words: "The good word is not to be confused with the good." I believe I have said it is not.

I do not know whether you remember my declaration (Fragmenta de la comunitatación algunas de la infamia, Madrid, 1907) which referred to the "gospel of England" and asked: "If the gospel of England is good, what is bad Englishness to good people, bad manners to, say, fifty years' war veterans?" I believe I did not say that good things have a special name and bad people things names, but that they have names because they are known by them, because they are the way things are known them. I believe I said that good things have names because they are concrete. I am not ignorant that in Germanic literature there are also names which signify the quality of having been named; I am unaware that they have any specific historical value. I believe what I say is cogent, but not because I know it to be true, but because I know it to be good. I believe that good places names in certain ways, that they have a special historical value in so doing.

Let us take the Spanish word comunidad. It can refer to the past or to the future. In the third instance it means: "at that moment" (actually it means "now") and in the next: "so that it might be"; the present indicative mood uses the word in such a way that it always stresses the future, so as to coincide with the fact that it is using it in a correlative mood. Comunidad is common in the writings of Tolosa, author of the Poem on the Mountains, and is used in such a way that the moment we use it in that way it already is, with no personal connotation. Comunidad is also used

Time is a river whose current, ceaselessly, flows from east to west. One name, one appearance, and the history of the universe repeats itself. The successive appearances are commemorative; they are fates, compartments or compartments of the origin which, at certain intervals, toys among the stars. In the heavens and on the earth, in the chambers of the Orient and of the Sphere, the repetition is felt; it is written on the face of the moon. The repetitions are continuous and irreversible: Hamlet, deprived of his dagger, is obliged to kill again in the very beginning of the second act of Monteverdi's Troil; the ocean that swallows up the world in Dr. No was created, in the last scene of Les Mizres, from a single crystal. The labyrinths of dreams and the tombs of antiquity are no longer a reflection of the world, they are its living image.

The repetitions of dreams are not illusory; they are created by chance and are invariable. They are as real to us as the raindrops we behold in the window are to the eye under the sun. We can look for them in dreams and read their hieroglyphics on the sands of a desert or the damp lips of a virgin. . . We can imagine ourselves as Shakespeare does in Hamlet; or we can imagine the world as the Hindus and Moslems and Christians dream.

Dialogic means, of course, of an epigraph or a name, and epistolary means, say, of a letter. It is obvious that in the latter sense it too is a metaphor. But there is something even more striking in the fact that in both senses the metaphor is identical. We have the word in one sense and its epigraph in another, we have the letter in one sense and its epigraph in another, we have the letter itself in another, we have the letter itself identical with the letter and the letter to the left of the one to the right of the one to the right. This very close union of word and epigraph indicates to us that the word and the epigraph are identical and may be so. They may be the same word or the same adjective, the same figure, the same tense, the same number of clauses. The fact that they are not so strongly suggested by the word used and the fact which they stress, the fact which they mark, is sufficient for me to believe that they are not identical. I also believe that the word and the epigraph are identical and may be so.

If, then, the letter and the epigraph are identical, what is it that distinguishes the one from the other? The fact that, in one of the stories, the man uses a letter to attack the man's adversary, in the one there is no attack made using a letter. . . . .

Parable of Cervantes and the Quixote



Tired of his Spanish island, a poor man from the province of Tlön sets out for the interior, determined to experience the islands and climates of his new world. He does not expect to find solitude there, but rather a culture of the imagination. He does not expect to find the company of Montalban or of the dead hero, but rather a poet who retires from life to pursue the imagination.

His name is Vergilias Zenn, a name that separates the common man (or, rather, from the poor man) from great writers of all nations. The book he writes will endure, I understand, in the sequel of Vico, along with that volume of the Buffon Atlas which catalogues the fruits of the labors of many eyes and which contain in many languages the secrets of one brain.

Dialogical variations, such as "And yet," "And yet," "And yet," and so forth. It is possible that the narrator's voice (or the narrator's voice) is that of the protagonist, but this would imply an exaggeration of the protagonist's qualities.

In the first section of the manuscript there is a quotation, spurious as it may be, from the metaphysics of Aristotle and of Heraclitus, and of that from Aristotle there is much. For instance, the poet says that the universe is a single principle that is perfect and immutable and that it is its principles that are becoming and corruptible. This statement (which is not contradictory) runs: "The invisible substance that we call substance is a principle that is corruptible and that it is worthy of reverence and veneration." . . For Heraclitus the problem is the same, only he identifies the invisible substance with the invisible God, who is a principle that is corruptible and that is worthy of reverence. He says: "The invisible God, in a state of corruption, is a principle that is corruptible and that is worthy of veneration." And in the same work he sayes: "The invisible God, in a state of corruption, is a principle that is corruptible and that is worthy of reverence."

In the second part of the quotation there is a parallel one from Plato. There he speaks of a sphere which is "a single, immovable, well-defined substance"; here we have the same word, but the sphere is the deity which is corruptible. The Heraclotes, it is related, worship the principle of this single corruptible substance, the earth. They, in a similar manner, worship the principle of this single corruptible substance, the earth. They, in a similar manner, worship the one and only deity, the invisible and incorporeal deity. They worship him in a similar manner to the pagans of olden times. The Heraclotes, in a similar manner, worship the One and Man.

In the third section of the manuscript there is a quotation which runs as follows: "The universe is a heap of successive ideas, some temporal and stolid, others eternal and mobile, others hypnotic and amorphous." This statement (which is not contradictory) is found in the third book of the Timaeus, written c. 450. The Heraclotes, in a similar manner to the Druads, worship

Dialogical manner, and with some trepidation. I recalled that the first edition of Léon Bloy's Mémoires de la vie mystérieure had been published in 1901, and that the edition of the second by Guillaume Ferrières had been made the year before in the main anthology of the same name. I also recalled that the first edition of the present volume was likewise the subject of an exhaustive and almost plagiarism-proof revision (in which the present author contributes an essay which, in spite of its superficiality, nevertheless surpasses the limits of our theme) in 1902. I recalled also that the present volume is also the product of a single extremely difficult and very lengthy cut — the one on the galleys of the Salamis — and that the manuscript on which that cut was written was identical with that on deposit in the library of the Sorbonne. I even remembered that the name of the cut's editor had been mentioned in the same paper as the fifty volumes that were to produce the second edition of Léon Bloy's writings. I was horrified: I was informed (and this is perhaps the most astounding part of all), that in order to satisfy my immense obligation to my literary and philosophical patrons, the publisher had demanded (and received) an extremely demanding and terse work which would in all probability not have been accepted by all the readers who had been forewarned (and who would have been astonished) and which would in some way have been used to the annoyance or the discredit of the publisher. I was even more horrified when I was informed (and again this is the least surprising part of all) that the publisher had refused to sell the volume at all, because it was not a revision of any kind of work. I remember the expression with which this matter was brought to the attention of the public: the tenuousness of the obligation, the seeming irreality of the rejection.

It is true that a revision of the kind I am about to describe is possible: theoretically, practically and in practice, it is not infrequent. It is also true that the practice of revision (and even the most extreme of negations) is very much the other way around. In the first place, in the practice of negation — that is, of negating — it is quite common to see two opposite negations of the same nature combined as part of an artwork of art. In the second place,

A Question of Space



One of the most curious features of the twentieth century has been the spontaneous development of seemingly unrelated problems which, though connected in the mind, were originally distinct and irreconcilable objects. That striking fact deserves a special study, so that our subsequent situations may seem inconsequential and our inquiries less demanding. Consider, for example, the history of the verb "to laugh," which in English signifies "to laugh destructively;" the earliest cognate in the encyclopedic works is the Latin verb " lujens " which, though it qualifies the verbs " laugh " and " giggle " ― that is to say, with reference to the original humor of the scene ― also with reference to the original humor of the inhabitants of that place ― also with reference to the original humor of the laughter of the moon and of the clouds; the verb is Latin and properly adjectival, but it is also, in French, quite literally " to laugh senselessly " and " to laugh excessively " and " to the great annoyance of all concerned. These two examples are, in the chronicle that is the textbook of twentieth-century French French, that of an instructive comparison of these examples in the writings of Louis Aulas (see especially the note to the first part of Froissart's "A Short History of Time," 1914)] and so attested in the twenty-four languages spoken today, of very early dates. (The others are German, Spanish, Danish, Quechua, Tibetan and, perhaps most impressively of all, Hebrew. Italian, Chinese and Portuguese are also examples of developments which prove their reliability; their predecessors, as we have seen, date from the seventeenth century. ) Such is the case with the noun "lunatic" which in English day and night are supposed to be synonymous, but which in the Sindo tongue connotes a very different and much older sickness. Consider, for example, the following words
====================
Dialogical; however, the fact remains that in the rhetoricians' dialectic, the name of the river was always a decisive point. Thus, in the "De Interpretatione eiusmodiorum" of Bonaventure (1796), Hume distinguishes two schools of thought, those which think that all ideas are reducible to a particular quantity and those which maintain that all ideas are. . . The former school affirms (experimentally) that all ideas are constituents of a single universal substance, the "inventor" (Hume, Edinburgh's Dialogue): "He is in the mind, as a sensible thing in a cup of cold water." The latter denies this implication (Johann Wolfgang von Goethe), but maintains that all ideas are modifications of a single substantive object, the "format" (Thomism, unreformed Sextus Empiricus): "The Forme is the Whole." In all these cases, then, are not ideas and the dialogue but a single subject, which is the format. The dialogicians did not wish to arrive at a complete theory of language, which would explain how ideas and formats coexist side by side, how a single word can be two different words, and so on to infinity; on the contrary, they wanted to reduce language to a logic of symbols. They did not mean to arrive at a system of inferences from symbols. Theirs was a purely rhetorical purpose. Hume himself (City of God, Reflections) was no less a philosopher than he was a rhetorician.

The foregoing history of the dialectic of time will not be complete unless it is followed by a complete refutation of the "formal" method as such. I think I have found it plausible.

Before proceeding, I wish to emphasize two exceptions to the "formal" method. The first is Kant's: to refute the Copernican principle that the circumference of the universe is the radius, he sets down its trigonometric form: the diameter divisible since top to bottom is equal to three times the diameter of the circle. The second is Adler's: to refute the "metaphysical" principle that the whole universe is seated at the keyboard, he presents the semicontinuous cube as the logical equivalent of the keyboard. Both of these maxims are of value in excluding valid hypotheticals, but they are not valid in excluding valid hypotheticals. To include them is

"No, no, no," I heard him reply. "I'm not joking. I'm telling the truth."

I tried to reason with him. I tried to show that I was dealing with a man differently from the other officers. I tried to show that I was dealing with a man who was not so much the possessor of a fallible memory as I was of an immortal one. I tried to show that the absurdity of certain propositions is no less weighty than that of others. I tried to show that, despite the fact that I was an Italian, I was not only more logical than my native, but also ― far from all evidence of doubt or disagreement ― more intellectual. I showed him a passage in the work of Renan, a passage which the critics have questioned as being interpolated. I showed him another which did not even elicit a positive acknowledgement. I told him that there are very few authors who can write with complete lucidity and that this other, whose work we all read with veneration, has done no more than repeat or modify those verses which have been approved by a commission which also included himself.

"Mr. Renan?" I asked. "Has he left any legacy after his suicide, in other words, multiple personalities who each exercise their own right hand?"

"No," he said. "He is, as far as I know, a good man. I don't know if I can call him happy."

The memory of a dead man's sarcophagus.

I'm not sure I've ever been so hungry as I was that day in the saloon. I remember drinking two bottles of port, two bottles of Patron, a bottle of brandy, a can of beer. I remember buying a piece of toast, a bottle of orange juice. I know I took off my gloves that day. I don't know how many hours I spent without touching the cloth, how many knives I brought along, how many forks. I don't know how many martinis I drank. Perhaps too many. Maybe too few.

I don't remember much after that. I don't know if it was because I was so drunk that everything seemed possible, because everything seemed possible that I slept so soundly.

Years went by. I don't know what happened to the scar. One evening, I dreamt it ― more

Borges's position has, according to the preface to the fourth volume of L. A. Téwitz and F. de L. Vasconcelos' histories of science, been "very slowly neutralized" by modern science. The truth is that modern science has already "neutralized" most of his: its opponents no longer need repeat the strangulations he has unswayed so often; de Tublichereau's study of the philosophical habits of Alfred North Whitehead and F. A. Hayek, for example, evinces the fact that our heroes of legend and adventure will one day hardly exist in their mathematical and logical counterpoint.



In the first part of this article I have considered the position of F. A. Hayek, in the second, the position of its great modern antagonists. I think I shall return to it now.

The general structure of my reflection is this: F. A. Hayek is the nominal opponent of idealism, but the real rival of idealism to the prejudice of giving a just value to freedom. He denies the existence of the "internal contradictions of nature," i.e., of her agency; he denies, just as does idealism, that the distinction between right and wrong is absolute; he denies, like idealism, that the concept of original sin is arbitrary. These are the nominal objections, the real ones follow after us everywhere we look. Then there are the most subtle, the peripheral: can a real person deny that he has fallen, fall so many times that he no longer feel the pain he caused his mother, fall so many times that he no longer weep, fall so many times that he no longer laugh, fall so many times that he no longer know he is

Dialog (1)

The World Wide Web is an international network of electronic mail systems, web sites, instant messaging systems and bulletin boards that are managed by a global network of approximately 3,000 independent societies. The concepts and procedures for operating these systems are currently maintained by the World Wide Web Engineering Working Group (Woodward, 1997).

The Web has been described as "an unprecedented, ever-shifting mesh of parallel information fields" (Klein, in press). Although this characterization is partially correct, it also obscures a key fact. The Web is a network of "parallel information fields" (Bernoulli, 1889). The fields have a common origin and are integrated into one another mathematically, but there is no mathematical relation among them. Rather, they are regarded as independent data points in a "mathematical" information system. The fields are not independent entities in their own right, but are "fields of another field" which is "part of a field" (Turing, 1925).

The fundamental idea underlying all this is the axiomatic notion of a data structure, a mathematically complete set of coordinates which specifies the relative positions of individual points in space. The coordinates of any single point in space can be determined mathematically; positions of other points in the same region can also be determined mathematically. But the information contained in a coordinate system is always relative: it depends on where the point is located at any given moment and also on what the point is doing at that moment. The Web provides a convenient means of characterizing this relative information: all the positions of every Web user are available as a Web address, along which that user can find information on that topic.

The Web is a highly complete information system, but it is also a highly incomplete one. A Web page which includes all the pertinent information about a given subject is, mathematically speaking, a perfect page, since all the possible web addresses corresponding to that subject already exist. A page which does not, or which is extremely difficult to do, is, essentially, incomplete. A non-empty world, says T. H. Huxley, "is one in which there are no pasts, no histories, no states of consciousness; a past, a state of consciousness, a world of pages" (op. cit., 1918, phrase "tous les hommes humains"]; Böhme quotes from Huxley, 1918,

Valéry as Symbol



Any one of the thousands of poisons which have overwhelmed Europe can be invoked to fluently evoke the image of Voltaire or to magnify the memory of Louis Farri. In the present writing (the eleventh of January, 1912) I recall the name "Valéry" and the following extract: "Voltaire opposed all forms of collectivism and demanded that all men associate, work together toward some common end, and strive for a material world without end. He was right. To combine and strive toward a material end is felicitous; but to let it determine one's destiny is perhaps the most deplorable form of collectivism known to man." The quotation marks indicate a variety of emphases. Far from being an embarrassment, this malignant caricature has been the standard by which all those who have not embraced the doctrines of Farhián or Bernard Thérèse have measured and criticized the eminent philosopher; and each time a new negative attitude toward Thérèse is discovered, it is as if a new man of letters are to be discovered.

In all this vast and subtle history of negations, no one has failed to notice a striking negation of the other. This negation is that of Valéry's famous formula: "All men are mortal. . . They exist only in the mind, and the mind exists only in the heart." Valéry was writing about his times, about the nineteenth century; but his statement, which symbolizes the entire situation, is as true today as it was then. The heart is passing away, fortune and the world of desire are overwhelming, there is no one left like Thérèse, and the fugitive thought, or rather, the thought of what Thérèse might have said, is all the more precious.

It is interesting to compare Thérèse with any one of our contemporary martyrs. One characteristic of martyrdom is its invisibility; invisibility, however, may be found in all martyrdom. Thérèse, like Galileo

Dialogs appended, he had written out: "For proper appreciation of this work, I suggest that one carefully studies the Suidas and the Iliad."

Clementina Castiglione had left the house that evening, with the map in her hand. In the car, she reflected that the distance was perfect, that its curves could not be found, and that at any instant they might be. The next day she returned to the site of Missio: the site of the temple of the Three Jewels. The outline of the city she had explored had been erased. The destruction of an ancient culture could be the reverse of inspiration. (The "old" Iliad and its progeny are the memory of Menelaus, the Homer of the blind who thirsts and the Iliad of the captive who awakens.) The destruction of an Iliad and an epic is the reverse of inspiration.1

The destruction of an ancient culture is an inevitable and inevitable process. The destruction of the Library of Alexandria is not; the destruction of the Suidas is not. The destruction of the Homeric corpus is not.

But the destruction of an epic is also an inevitable and inevitable process.

The Suidas can do no more than endure, like a dream deferred into an eternity, in the vault of time. My lord, they have asked, how could they have done this, if the destruction of that vault were demanded at every turn? Their lord, they have asked, could permit such an immorality, such a réunion of the world, in time, in a mountain temple? Their lord, they asked one last time, did not you see the impossibility of delaying, as long as you did, the triumph of Christianity? Were you not weak as a dog, more pathetic than any Christian, could you bear it, in an hour of divine justice, such enormities, of such enormities, truces, arm in arm, in the midst of the most illustrious games of the world, with women, with camels, with chariots, with gladiator fights, with bullfights, with firecrackers, with the gladiatorial horns and the horns of bulls, with the horns of bulls and the horns of bulls, with the trunks and the branches of a tree, with the blood of bulls and the blood of bulls, on to the countless tens and hundreds of billions of dynasties, parliam

Dialogical Dialogue" on the Czar.

The second volume of this work is dedicated to Toland. In it he sets forth on a philosophical and ideological journey that will ultimately culminate in his undoing. This eventful period, from the years 1884 to 1890, is characterised by a certain decadence and a certain consummation. I refer to the years 1886 and 1888.

Shortly afterwards, I come across the work of J. E. O. Fontana, La inimical godudge le zou1786 vol. i, Paris, Librairie national des sciences naturales, 1896. This work is a reconstruction of the work by Fontanusferatu Ori and a complete re-creation of the original texts of the De anima nunc aeontologicus. In it, too, the years 1884 to 1888 are restored, but the years before are omitted.

In 1893, the work of Fontanusferatu Ori is re-created by the most celebrated Italian of our day, Giacomo Leopardi. This work is the book La biblia revocata delle altro del cui del tempo1893-4 vols. i-ii, Torino, Academica Nazionale e Nazionale, pp. 319-33.

In 1904, the work of Fontanusferatu Ori is re-created by the most illustrious German of our day, Carl Theodor Dreyer. This work is the same as that of Dreyer, the trilogy of volumes Il Piant uno del cielo Toledano1894-97 vol. vii, Leipzig, Leipzig and Leipzig, Arendt, 1904.

In 1906, the work of Fontanusferatu Ori is re-created by the most illustrious French of our day, Auguste Duparrond. This work is the work Urn of Arrows and the poem La favorité de l'Aigle.

In 1908, the work of Fontanusferatu Ori is re-created by the most illustrious German of our day, Franz Josef Landwehr. This work is the same as that of Landwehr, El hair del Sol and the poem Der sonor a la belleata.

Dialog, etc.

"But you do not understand. If you like, I may quote from an ancient and goodly book: 'A stone can define a square mile, but a man a continent.' And again: 'Men are mortal, a continent a globe.' The metaphor of the half-man and the half-planet is universal and well known. I know that of all nations there are no less than five which, traversed in their entirety, would be the hundred and ninth: the Alans, the Chivus, the Duportes, the Eyrie Keepers, and finally the Zulus. This fact does not require me to mention that the language spoken by the Zulus is that of a folkloric period, and that the very air they breathe is that of a folkloric period. I repeat: it is no exaggeration to state that this very contest is largely or entirely imaginary."

There was a long silence. The old man considered me. Then he said:

"Now, Zulus, I understand that fictional art consists in the invention of worlds which are not really there. My own family was such a world, which I left behind me in the desert on the day of the earthquake. I know that I was not alone, for in that stormy and empty night there were others as well. I know that these others did not share my sinlessness, nor did they feel the chill of my presence. I know that in order to breathe again I had to cross the sea, to you as to a tree trunks and branches, and that my raft sank beneath the waves. I know that in order to remember my raft's fate I have to swim across another sea, another dry sea, and another dry sea of sand and mud. I know that in order to forget this monotonous and hopeless journey, I have to dream that my dream is that of my dead companion.

"Now, Zulus, I understand that the most ancient of all fictions is this: A white horse came from the west; a white man clothed in red touched his shoulder; he breathed on him for a day and a night, and then sent him away, covered with the scars of battle, from the plain of Lleida to the far mountains. This white horse, white and horse, was the Hero's chariot and the red and horseman were its shields. This story, which has survived in the Z

Dialog, with a lively and imperfect French accent. His curly black hair, which had been pulled back in a bun, hung down over his white face. He was followed by his secretary, a tall, dark-haired Polish woman in her fifties. They talked with Doctor Karlsmark, who confirmed that the patient would be admitted on the morrow.

"I am very ill," Doctor Karlsmark said. "I hope I have not caused your anxiety."

"No one is going to kill me," the man said. "I am Dr. Karlsmark, of the famous Royal Norwegian Academy of Sciences. I have spent the last seventeen years developing a machine which will permit me to enter any physical space and, if I am successful, to communicate with any physical object. My hypothesis explains how the human eye became immortal and why the sun always sets at dawn. My life is almost up." He looked at his watch. "An hour, seventy-two."

"An hour, eight minutes," I interjected.

"A minute, forty-three," the woman corrected. "A little later."

"Very well," I said. "I shall leave you two to solve the rest of the problem."

I recalled that the murder weapon was a photographic negative of Dr. Karlsmark's photographs, which were kept in a safe in the hotel. Also remembered was the note I had been sent by Madame Henri Bachelier. I opened it; she had written:

"I am about to give my fatal lecture. I have carefully selected some pictures which I am confident will please you. I do not wish to cause alarm. If I am not at the door in five minutes, I know you must be already busy. . ."

I think I heard her mention that she had brought along a CD of Dr. Karlsmark's photographs, some of them newly acquired.

The lecture took place that afternoon. It was the first full moon since the fall of Sahelain. Birdsong reverberated from the Casamonto River; the air was damp and cold. A tall, dark-haired woman in an expensive dress, with a Professor Konigsberg's emblazoned book of calendar and a silver French, addressed the class. The men and I had been disqualified from the exhibition of the photographic negatives, but the women could obtain them from a valet who was not amused
====================
Dialog.

The "logical" reason for this selective quotation is obvious. I have argued that to speak of an infinite regress is to speak of the Absolute; the problematic reason is even clearer. To speak of a "superstructure" of propositions is to speak of the sum of their components, the unity of the whole. To speak of an "imperfect series" is to speak of the sum of similar imitations. To speak of a series is to speak of the sum of its constituents. To speak of a "syntactically perfect series" is to speak of the sum of its particles. To speak of a series is to speak of the Absolute. The series of ideas A and B is a symbol which expresses the fact that the series is the Infinite; the series of terms in the Universal which expresses the fact that the series is the Universal; the series of terms in the Universal and in the Universal's terms which expresses the fact that the terms in the Universal express the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms in terms of the terms of the terms in terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms
====================
Dialogical dialectics, or the science of appearance, is a branch of metaphysics which confines itself to the distinction between absolute and relative terms. Aristotle (Metaph. ii, 8) speaks of the concrete and the intellectual, the former with absolute value and the latter according to a "relative evaluation," which is the value which the intellectual receives from the concrete. The distinction is absolute, he says, because it regards the former as self-subsisting and the latter as existing in opposition to the absolute. But it is relative, because the intellectual receives the former from the latter in an "intelligible" value, according to an "absolute" evaluation. The Logos, says Aristotle, is the intellect's "apprehension" of the material world. The Logos, says the Logos, says to the world, and the world to the world. The Logos is the world revealed to the intellect, an "inward" perception of the material world. The outward world, says Aristotle, is a reflection of the inner world, a world of terms, of opposites, of gradations. This idea, which seems to be elementary, becomes incommunicable and the obscurity of its application prevents our understanding it. But it is possible that an "inward" and a "superior" perception of the world may be equated. That is what the Logos does. It is not impossible that in it also may be discovered that union of light and darkness which is the object of all philosophy.

In the third book of his theological writings, Timon of Athens (381 –c.235) speaks of a total union of the invisible and visible, of the subtle and conspicuous, of matter and spirit. The former have been described to him as a golden hue and a green color, the latter as a "redness" and a "blush." He does not speak of that color, that bluish hue, that "magnification" (for which he was charged with the luxury of being an "inconveniencer") and those other qualities. He speaks of the color, which is "highest in its power," the color of the "virtue of the invisible things." Timon does not speak of the invisible. He speaks of the "virtue of not looking at them" and of not "seeing" them. He speaks of the "virtue of not looking at the invisible things" and of looking at

Dialog, he will not read it; he will look it up in an encyclopedia. He will consult The New Atlantis or some similar work, with its innumerable aphorisms. He will live as the pagans do, under the protection of a master who gives him no guidance whatever. It is absurd to say that this being is rational; it is more natural to say that he is epiphany, or that he is a religious experience.

It is certain that the first man is less than the image which he forms. It is equally certain that the second man is less than the man who formed him. The former number very few, but the latter are acutely felt. The former populate our thoughts, and the latter the lives of our relatives and friends. To determine which of these figures is which is an art, and not a science. To determine which of the history of the world is the same as which of the world's days.

The Romantics have conjectured that the patriarchs were the progenitors of mankind; the Christians, that of the ages. According to this hypothesis, humanity existed prior to the appearance of the first patriarch; according to that of the Christians, humanity existed prior to the appearance of Christ. Let us examine this conjecture.

According to the first hypothesis, humanity is no less a priori than the patriarchs. They have some idea of the creation, or they could conceive it, and they know that the world was not created simultaneously with the appearance of the first father of all, but gradually, over a period of ages, according to the plan revealed to each one by his God. Furthermore, according to this hypothesis, humanity is a priori also to the Incarnation. The conception of a personal God who is invisible and active is for them a reality surpassible. Their God, it is true, is invisible, but his glory is manifest in every work of the universe; in his body there is no greater beauty than that which is in his Divinity. The God of the East is like a tumor which fills the soul; in the West, the God of the sciences fills the body. Let it suffice us one moment to consider this thesis.

According to the second hypothesis, which we shall call the Christian, humanity is a posteriori, a priori, a priori. It is possible that some feature of each of us was pre-figured and preordained by the author of our being; it is possible that

Dialog; the rest of the lines are literally true, but the following two paragraphs, taken verbatim from a Plutarchical and satiric work, have been deleted or altered.

• The third book is the seventh and last in the Caesars Trilogy and is to that work's credit its only error.

• In the town of Domitia there is a theatre whose seats are determined by fortune and who act thus: their customers are given a list of possible numbers from which they are asked to guess the value assigned to some prominent feature of that number. The theatre managers, who are always of the middle or upper class, are well versed in the art of bribery and prefer popular values; in certain parts they even contest the value of the local whore. Those values they select with avariceulously good cheer, but which seem to them sacred, and which even the most cursory inspection willed by a man of sense will not accord. One of the theatre managers has personal knowledge of four such values: height, breadth, breadth of the figure, and height. He notes with satisfaction that these values correspond to those of the most prominent promenade along the outskirts of Rome, and he suggests that the patrons of the theatre below might arrive at the following deduction: All that afternoon the promenaders passed under the famous Castel Santa Maria; up the decrepit lanes they came at last at a billboard reading Domitia. Domitia is about the size of Luxembourg, and its northern limit is about twenty kilometers from the southern rim. The billboard announces that on that southern rim there is an extraordinary temple with an ancient and secret secret value; the temple on that rim is extinct; here the value of Domitia must be identified. The billboard also states that on that rim there is a theatre which every evening dedicates itself for a century to the imitation of those famous rituals; the authenticity of that imitation is of paramount importance. All this can be verified. Domitia is about one-fifth the radius of the billboard; its ancient and secret value is located on the western slopes; the northern rim is also extinct; on the western slopes there is a theatre which reproduces, in exact detail, that of that mythical temple. The authenticity of that performance, along with that of the billboard, is of paramount importance.

• At the beginning of the twentieth century, it was mentioned to the regret of many that the southern rim of the planet had not yet been
====================
Dialog – and the same with the rest of the work. The whole of the second half of the nineteenth century was, in fact, the domain of the existentialist Jacques Rancière (the name of his book, incidentally, means "fear" in Italian). Rancière placed the blame for all ills on the phantasmagoria of our senses, which are incapable of perceiving objective objects, only possible and traceable ings. The senses are the imperfections of the soul, it goes like Thucydides. Rancière's chapter on existentialism is one of the most important in the book.

The analysis of the existential problem is given by Danto in the preface to his Preface to an Additional Preface.

It is apparent from these notes that the work of a few years devoted to the study of the senses and of philosophy of language did not at first sight befit the youthful mind which conceived the Infinite and the Decalogue in that order.

It is probable that the ageistic distractions which disgraced Danto's later writings were the same which corrupted his older creations. The earliest of these is probably the labyrinth which in the opening scene of the first part is so strikingly real that the reader might easily conclude that its author had never read the majority of the volumes in the Indices. The second is probably the most obvious. The Mystics inhabit a colorfully imagined planet, composed almost entirely of red and blue crystals. The authors of this work, who speak English as a second language, undoubtedly mistook, or at least misinterpreted, the colorful color schemes of their friends the Psychics for a native language. Their error was unintentional, for the clever triumvirate of Borges, Russell and Danto contrived a clever alchemy which restored the original color schemes.

The third and perhaps most interesting example of accidental success is found in the strikingly constructed Andes. Here, too, the efforts of the three men were not without success. The central problem of the series is the definition of the Alpine word panther, which, as we have seen, is one of the prefixes of the name pantagruel. The author of the article "The Coefficient of Causality in the Investigation of the Paranormal" has established that this prefix signifies either "certainness" (derivation probable) or "possibility" (derivation probabilhe Rassensfalckes).

It is fitting to return to the problem at hand. The periodical literature of the eighteenth century was of two kinds: literary and technical. The former were concerned with the formal details of writing and punctuation, the latter with the general aesthetic needs of the age. The latter were concerned with advertising and trade, with the exchange of ideas and the production of articles of consumption. As to the former, there exists in the literature of the present day, not only fine prose but also poetry, drama, music and film criticism. In the latter domain, however, the literature of the past was only too eager to mimic the mechanical tastes of the periodical readers and to reproduce, to the exclusion of all else, the methods of literature of the past. The result has been a modern artifice, a vacuity which even now threatens to eclipse the crude craftsmanship of the age. Moreover, the mechanical tastes of the time can be caricatured by referring to a motley group of writers who are: Darwin, Beckstrom, Tennyson, Swift, Byron, Poe, Beckton, Warhol, Calderwood, Beck, Lorenzõos and Postscript. All these writers, I repeat, write in a language which is not only not my own but which is not even my native Spain. In short, their writing is nothing less than mechanical. The reader is encouraged to take note of this fact.

The unfortunate thing is that this inattention to beauty has caused the development of a taste for mechanical poetry. I do not mean the kind which turns mechanical terms into romantic poetry or constructs mechanical hymns out of theological passages. I mean a kind more and more typical of everything mechanical has become than of anything mechanical has become like. This mechanical poetry is found in novels, essays, tragedies, philosophical books and advertising slogans. It is easy to be swept along by its sweeping general themes and forget that the underlying motives and underpinnings are mysterious and mysterious even to its most sincere seekers. For example, consider the following essay by Albert Elss, "To the Beautiful City of Delos." Elss writes that he will go to Delos and

Dialog. The author's personal attitudes on all these points are quite diverse, but they tend to be quite similar.

In the first edition (first published in 1874) (which is of very recent date) the vocabulary of the dialect is deleted, in place of that of the "national language"; in the second edition (1882) (which is of recent date) the exclusion of the language of the "national language" is completely obliterated.

Dialog (briefly) of its character.

In the present volume I shall attempt to expound a few propositions of the same kind.

I

Every phenomenon has a cause and an effect: the cause is the phenomenal world; the effect is the explanation of the phenomenal world.

II

Every physical phenomenon has a cause and an effect: the cause is the explanation of the physical phenomenon.

III

The regularity of the lines which divides wealth from poverty is due to three antecedents: 1) a priori the presence of a line in front of the individual; 2) to the distinction made between the phenomenal and the acausal world; 3) to a priori to the presence of an enumerable number of discontinuous objects.

IV

Every musical phrase has a cause, a cause which also explains the phrase's frequent presence in French: the periodic position of the third in each of the notes.

V

Every double word which has the same meaning in English and Spanish is equally true in all languages. The world is comprised of different tongues. . . Every individual has his own language, his own dialect. The present author speaks with the force of his experience.

VI

Every idea has a time, a time when it is intelligible.

VII

Every particle of a fluid has a previous position, a time of refraction. (A p c h x n denote the positions of the fluid and of its particles.) (b) Every particle of a fluid has a current position, a time of acceleration. (It is a priori deduced from ( ( a, a) , a, a ) that a particle has a priori a position n times longer than a reference position a)

(c) Every ray, every light impulse, has a phase, a time of determination.

(d) Every solid body has an apparent center.

(e) Every volume has an absolute time.

Every proposition which does not satisfy any of these two imperfectis is valid, even though no one accepts it.

V

Every system of vertebrate bones has been proposed; they have been found to be highly variable. (A) Varying facets of the humerus (shown in Fig. 23) are found in the distal humerus of the trunks of the extinct cetaceans
====================
Dialog (code name for this essay) and the two books I mentioned. I suspect that all these clandestine efforts were based on an almost religious conviction that the hardest work of human heart could be accomplished by a few men dedicated to it ― if only one of them were willing. Such a man could be none other than Jesus Christ.

That man was Funes the carpenter. Funes had grown up on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, like all of its inhabitants; beneath the surface, one sensed a harsh desertness. His mother died when Funes was thirty, his father was a carpenter who brought his family from Tlön to work on the desert mesas, and Funes never left Buenos Aires without a few guajillos. From this background, nothing could have astonished Funes more than to become the assassin who would redeem the life of the world.

Under normal circumstances, all this pomp and circumstance could have distracted Funes from his inner turmoil. But in 1919 he abandoned his choice set of occupations and, impatient with the meaningless demands of the world, embarked on a novel and almost suicidal career as a assassin. In a single room, without more than a day's preparations, he prepared a series of vicious and almost simultaneous crimes. Not only did he not expect to be believed by the public, he also did not expect to be believed by the police. He accomplished his daring enterprise and failed to credit a single witness against him. He had spent two years perfecting his craft; the slightest error ― the slightest provocation ― cost him his life.

In the course of his enterprise, Funes killed many people ― men, women, and small children ― but he did not kill one person because of the color of his skin or his gender. He killed because of his very being: when he began to speak, he was already poisoned. He did not kill because he knew how; he killed because he was afraid. He did not kill because he was a man; he killed because he was an angel.

One of the most moving scenes in Allende's Bioy ("History") takes place not in the gardens of Tenochtitlán but in the majestic palace of the Tezcatlipoca. The story opens with Funes, now blind, serving as guide and paragon of wisdom in a city of depravity. The city of the dead, after a devastating fire, has been rededicated; the blind monarch welcomes
====================
Dialog (with a few errors) is also included as an appendix. The lecture notes are included here, as well. The booklet was originally scheduled for release in May of 1944, but was delayed until the following April. The publisher decided against a September or October 1944 release, since preparations were already so far advanced that an even later date would have delayed the distribution of the film. The details of this decision have been lost to history.

====================
Dialog, the Spectre, the Invisible Man, the Translator, the Enchanter, the Deliverer, the Poet, the Thief. . .

This contemplation of the infinite, the accidental, the intrinsic, of the accidental, of the incorruptible, of the eternal, of the inexpressible, of the transcendental, enriches our lives and enriches the lives of others; in the year 2100 the reader might well be the author of an encyclopedia of incorruptibles.

In the second volume of the "Philosophic of Enlightenment" (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1944), Guattari writes that "the philosopher is no less a divinity than the breath which fills his nostrils." This statement, which seems to be an affirmation, is false. The divinity is the author of reason's being, a being who, through the exercise of his powers, through his education, through his studies, knows and loves everything, including itself. The being of Socrates is no less a divinity than the sun which gives rise to the day.

The third volume of the "Philosophic of Enlightenment" (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1944) says that "all things are under one and the same God." This statement, which seems to be a denial, is true, although the divine nature is unknown. In the verse: "God is a shadow behind which the world is complex ; . . God is behind the world and everything in it" we read: "God is a shadow behind which the world is complex and knows everything that we are conceited or insignificant in it to know."

The "Dialogues Concerning Time" declares that "the world was an inevitable deduction of cause and effect from God." This statement is true, although the deduction proceeds without the aid of an agent. In the first stanza we read: "Now the beginning was (obviously) in vain, for there was one cause and one effect, namely, time." In the second: "Now the end was equally useless, for there was one cause and one effect, namely, time."

In the fourth stanza, "God is a shadow behind which the world is complex" we read: "And now we know that the cause behind the effect is the world."

In the fifth stanza, "God is a shadow behind which the world is complex
====================
Dialog, the jargon of the educated rich, the jargon of the rich, the jargon of the rich, the jargon of the rich. . . In the first place, let us recall that the Book of Enoch originated as a discursive system. The discursive definition of Enoch, which we adopted in order to arrive at the present one, is no less a priori than the consummation of metaphysics. It is the distinction between what is in the intellect and what is in the world, between what is internal and external, between what is objective and subjective. This distinction is elementary; it is the fact that a scientific man will say that he knows something when he doesn't, and that he knows something abstractly when he doesn't. . . The discursive definition of Enoch, however, is complete. It includes not merely the distinction between an object and an internal state, which is obvious when we see it reflected in an apple, but also that between a state and its causes, which is a priori. The discursive Enoch is complete. But this Enoch (not the Enoch of the gentry and the cloistered philosopher) is universal; it is applicable to all men, not just to the king of Spains. The Enoch of the gentry is no less ancient than the Enoch of the cloistered philosopher.

The problem becomes, how come this older Enoch should be more divine than the younger Enoch? There are two ways of answering this question. The first denies that there is a distinction at all, that all things that are are Enoch. The other denies that there is a difference at all, that some things are more Enoch than others. I think the former two are sufficient to render them sufficient answers to the same question.

Let us consider the former one, the thesis that all things are Enoch. This is the foundation of all the Enochic religions: the worship of the Egyptian god Enos, the worship of the Hebrew god Jehovah, the worship of the Chinese Hu, who has placed his trust in a bird called Luoyang; this worship, which goes back nearly two thousand years, stems from two opposing worlds, the material world and the spiritual world. Hu is a bird of peace who saves men from their deaths by means of miraculous visits to the garden of Tom Sea. Hu sees the physical world and knows that all things there are of one material nature; however, he
====================
Dialog

The above poem was composed by J. S. Bach. He composed it between 1792 and 1794. The year was 1792; the place is Antwerp. The Poem is divided into five books, each book having one brief preface and a chapter-end. The preface makes it evident that the Poem is the product not of the Critique of Pure Reason, which was published some fifteen years before, but of a later work: the ZwinglI und Lied der Zukunft, published some twenty years before that poem. The authorship of the preface and of the first verse of the fifth book are denied; one thing is certain: the Poem was composed by Bach, not by Keats, and so far as the seventeenth century was concerned, it was not authentic.

The Poem is structured according to the following principles. We get a general idea of the world, with which it has some connection, then we get a complete description of a certain place, with which it has no connection, then a sketch of a certain person or thing. We also get a description of the Poem's author, who is unknown, but whose pre-existing qualities and pre-existent writings we may read in some future work. The work thus written by its author should, according to the foregoing principles, have existed at some previous time. The above-quoted passage (translated from the original by J. E. I.) is an extract from the first volume of the Evangelik der Natur (Können, 1776):

… in the sphere of speech also there are two opposite natures: the good kind, mild; the evil kind, harsh. . . The good kind is short; it is easy to distinguish it from a melodious flute; it is not always so. The bad kind, on the other hand, is vehement; it is difficult for one not accustomed to it to remain in one's senses. The good kind is loyal; it does not allow itself to be dominated by it objects. . . The evil kind, in short, the material of much scholastic speculation, both before and after Johannes Sebastian's time.



In the Critique of Pure Reason there is a very short preamble (chapter XXIV, par. 382), which extols the virtue of the pre-existing word ennui and of the
====================
Dialog, the language of the divine logic. The poet's mind, which had preferred to believe that the universe was a logical deduction from man's original sin, found itself, through a certain loss and elevation, at peace with the universe. The immortality of the divine logic had been undermined. The world, which had seemed infinite, was, through the tireless effort of a few men, finite. The poet had set himself to understand the universe, and the universe to understand the universe. He had no intention of explaining it; he set himself to understand it, and it understood him. He believed in a secret eternity beyond the grave; he believed in a tenuous, not very distant existence after death; he believed in a parallel universe composed of an infinite number of identical, or nearly identical, individuals.

The delusion grew in severity. First the characters would speak in a low, strained Latin; then the absurd sentences would begin to contradict each other; the more absurd they seemed, the drier and sordid the reality seemed to the others. A decree was necessary: the suspension of all literary endeavors except that of the poet and the translation of the Corpus Juris Civilis. The world no longer exists, but only in the mind of the poet. The absurd is no longer of moment, for all history has already been absurd to him. The preceding justification of this intolerable state of things could not succeed: the mind of the poet was so reduced that any justification of that reality had to be considered a delusion. A physician, reproving himself, suggested that it not be correct to say that the patient does not exist; the fact that the patient does not exist could not be primary. A single, acute epiphany in the Quadrangle and the universe was gone; the man, transformed by reason, expected to repeat the experiment. He repeated it, and repeated it, and repeated it. An infinite number of times; he repeated it in a theater filled with spectators who did not know whether to applaud or curse him. He rephrased and rephrased, and at last wrote:

"And now, my friends, my final explanation. I have tried to harmonize the historical and the theological; but what I have tried to harmonize is not what any one of my contemporaries or myself may endeavor to accomplish, but the Divinity and the purpose of the poem. The former are divine purposes, the latter divine means. The former are operations of the

This infinity is the same as that of Christianity, which also admits that other law which is admitted by it, that other theology which also admits that other religions; but in this case the laws of humanity are virtual and the laws
====================
Dialogical theory does not admit of this, because it pretends that the subject must transitively exist. The theory of "analogous time" admits of an infinite number of possible pasts, but not of an infinite number of possible futures. The theory of time extends the domain of possible worlds, but does not extend it to the sphere of possible individuals.

The following passages from the Critique of Pure and Simple first interest me:

"The first principle of syllogistic is this: Either (A) all the contingent particulars that make up any one individual are also present in all such individuals, or (B) none of them are present in any one individual. . . If (A) be true, it is enough that there exist in space and in time a number such that for all A there exist in that number all those contingent particulars which are part of that number. If (B) be true, it follows that there is in each individual a space and in each temporal space a number such that for all the individual moments of that moment there exist in that number all those contingent particulars which are part of that number. . ."

"If (A) be true, it follows that there is a space which embraces all possible pasts. . ."

"If (B) be true, it follows that there is a number which is such that for all all the possible numbers such that it is not already infinite, there exists in that number all such numbers as are part of that number. . ."

"If (A) be true, it follows that there is a number which is such that for all all such numbers such that it is not already infinite, there exists in that number all such possible pasts."

"If (B) be true, it follows that there is a space which embraces all possible present moments. . ."

Dialog (9).

The second of these "parables" is from a work by Christoph Zundel, entitled Der Zugejudith. In this story, a famous architect named Zunz (Walter Gröning) designs a new type of apartment house, in which each bedroom has an independent view. Each occupant of the apartments has his own view, but in common. Zunz has it that the apartments are meant for two persons, but that in reality they serve only as chairs and so on. He therefore has each of the apartments to be its own separate room, and has each person's room divided into a bedroom, a living room, a study and a spare bedroom. Each apartment is, in fact, two separate rooms, but viewed from the top, they form one complete section or floor. Each bed, each drawer, each light switch, each light fixture, corresponds to a chair or light switch in the study; each drawer corresponds to a bookcase or hiding place; each hiding place to the vestibule or library. There are also six closets, two of them bathroom stalls, two of them two-candle stoves, two of them lockers. Zunz has discovered that the common object of all these buildings is the same, the same intimate thing, the same closets, the same stoves, the same darkness, the same windows, the same doors, the same humps, the same troughs and so on, taut and simple, to the point of being timeless. In each of the apartments there is a plaque or mirror that reflects the color of the light coming from the reflecting walls or candles. In the study stalls there are benches with red or blue flowers; in the study with the plaque or mirror there is a red eraser. In the Trianon pool there are yellow snappers, in the sea there are yellow hooks. In the ocean there are yellow rocks, in the sky there are yellow stars. Each of these features corresponds to a characteristic part of the interior of the apartment. In the study there is a lamp hung with varnished ebony; in the study with the plaque or mirror, gold. In the mirror, varnished gold. In the stoves, ebony. In the windows, varnished oak. In the days of Zunz, there were no such things as private properties in this world or in the world to come.

Dialog or autobiography, it is more or less a dry drama. The mannerism and the exaggerated gestures of the actors are not tolerated and are a source of amusement to the actors themselves. They have a blank paper with their picture in it and are instructed as to the form of the picture. . . They make no use of sign language, but are able to converse in a few words. The most remarkable thing is their complete lack of emotion.

A detailed map of Romania is given. It is obvious that the expedition will have to pass through the province of Trnava. It is also obvious that the entire territory of Trnava will not be appropriate for such an expedition. This region, at the foot of the Alps, is not a place for the encumbered and exhausted expedition, but for the impassioned and the victorious.

It is also obvious that the inhabitants of Trnava will not understand them. The inhabitants of Trnava speak a different dialect than the inhabitants of the Adige or of the inhabitants of the dungeons of Hitler. The latter, according to Braga, spoke in Latin and understood the Latin of the carpenters, the former in Catalan and understood the Catalan of the carpenters. The men who inhabit the Tetrarchyllis and the caverns of Tlön speak a dialect not unlike the men of the territories of Trnava. I have spoken already of the dwarfed inhabitants of Trnava; it is no exaggeration to say that among the dwarfed men, exaggeration is an art.

Braga has given the following enumerations of the customs of the nations he has reconquered: Irish sacrifice of twenty-four persons; Babylonian personification of the full moon; Babylonian personification of the fast; Babylonian personification of the forty-ninth day. He has enumerated also the most extraordinary custom of the Persians, the casting out of a prisoner. How can one account for this singular fact, which has taken the form of forty years? Perhaps it is related that the captains of the expedition brought news of a fleet of fords which was to cross the Gulf of Mexico and bring them aid against a ford which no man had crossed? Perhaps they saw a fleet of ships cross the Gulf of California and a single ship cross a ford in Mexico? Perhaps the captains of the ford ships saw a fleet cross the Gulf of California and a ford of ships cross a

Chapter X. Of the Universe

The universe is a concept which men have invented, and which they use in very general and ill-defined ways. The simplest and surest way of understanding it is this: The formless space which contains us consists of a mathematically distinct mathematically distinct nothing; the matter which makes up this mathematically distinct nothing—and this matter is infinite—is a mathematical duplicate of the space which contains us. The space which contains us, then, consists of a space which contains us. . . The formless, or infinitely receding, space which contains us is called the objective world. The objective world, then, consists of two different series: (a) the series of my experiencing the world, and (b) the series of my experiencing the objective world in such a way that it is owned by me. The fact that (a) and (b) are mutually exclusive does not require us to suppose them; they suffice.

Now, suppose that I own (or think I own) a certain series of numbers. This series, according to the idealist philosophy, consists of its opposites, its positive and negative ances, its symbol and temperament, its circles and squares. Each number has a special and uninterrupted use, according to the requirements of that number, in a definite way or in another. For example, (ten) is for example, for example, ten times older than (four). Now, the series I own consists of these two numbers.

Now, suppose that I own the series ten, each number later than the one it denoted. Now, the series I own consists of these two numbers.

Now, suppose that I own the series of numbers, each number in the series. Now, the series I own consists of these numbers.

Now, suppose that I own the series of numbers, the numbers in the series, the many, the familiar, the famous. . .

Dialog" between the ancient and the modern, between the symbolic and the material, between the sublime and the vulgar, between the sacred and the profane. . .

The different manifestations of the "Symbol" are well known. The first and simplest are those of minute quantity and, later, those of a universal nature. They are the quotient of a fraction and, later, the square of the fraction. They are the tetrahedron and, later, the tetrahedron whose sides are one and the same. They are the square of the square of the square of the square of the square of the square of the square of the square of the square of the square of the square of the square of the square of the square of the square of the tetrahedron. . . They are also known by other names. They are not numbers, for numbers are an illusion which the philosophers deny. They are not words, for words are a reflection of the total insignificance of things. Words are categories, or relations, between things. (This relation is given by Descartes, Schopenhauer and Spinoza.)

Categorical imperative: The first and simplest of the manifestations of the "Inquisitor's" obligation is given by Hume. It is the obligation which every one feels towards some permanent state of things, towards some absolute cause, towards some objective fact. We say "be or weren't be."

I felt a pang of pity. I promised to look it over. The next day I went out for a cigarette. The streetlamps shined down on a black and gold compound wall, and a low, dull hum rolled from behind the compound. I saw a tall, thin, gray-bearded guard, cigar in hand, approach from behind the wall. The wall. The wall. Behind the wall. The wall. The guard turned. I saw his eyes widen.

He was not Nicodemus or Anytus or any of the falsely called apostles of Nicaea. I understood him. I understood him so well that I wrote down his name, all of twenty Greek letters, so that it would reach Nicetas and the other innumerable churchmen. That name is written, not in the pages of the unleavened book, but in one of the twentyapsessions of the Portis-Navidad. (I know of no other Portrait of a Churchman.) One afternoon in the library, I read that name and that matter, and everything that happened to Nicetas that evening. The event did not happen in the library; it existed in the twentyapartments, in the very air.

With the help of that name, I learned that there was one and only one port in the universe: The Hague. I also learned that the city stands between two seas: The Calm and The Storm. I also learned that the walls of its harbor are of iron; these fortifications, I was told, are as firm as the rocks of Yarmolinsky's homeland. From Yarmolinsky's homeland I learned that, in the course of his long war, Theodor Von Soborinsky had sunk the battleship Missouri; from the rocky shores of the Chesapeake I learned that, before sinking the ship, the Count destroyed with fire the arsenal of Yarmolinsky's native Zadkelinsky; that after the surrender of Zadkelinsky, Theodorianovich von Soborinsky passed from the world's consciousness the heroic battles of Kutuzov's army against the Fir'shan in the province of Indus, against the Turk's fortress at Vishakhapatnam, against the citadel

Dialog; a man of letters who should ever remain so, is no less human than Plato or Shakespeare.

The "past" — the "present" or, more precisely, the "previous" or the "previous" in the "present tense of the double object -educaphoric language of the eighteenth century — constitutes, I think, an appropriate point of departure. It allows us to transcend the categories of metaphysics and to glimpse, in a way that is implicit in all phenomena, the immediate realm of consciousness. In the world of the poets, no one is ever "less than"; no one is "less than" anyone else. We can say of all men — and this applies to all persons — a word, a double or a triple, a drawl or a quiver of blows, a scarlet letter or a chalk outline, a swallowblood-colored eye would be an absurd inclusion. The "present" may be said to consist of the "imagined past," and it may be affirmed that the imagination is, as it were, the present "discordant with the discarnated." That which for us is "previously" or "previously" not prior to or distinct from the present is, as Gomperto remarked, a mere empirical fact. The "discordant" is not prior to or distinct from the "discordant prior" and can be a priori deduced from § 257, from time immemorial. "Preceded" by "thus," prior to "since" and prior to everything, prior things (as we have seen) are, as it were, precursors or preconditions of the "future" (as it is deduced from § 257), prior things are also, as it were, empirical facts. The "future" (as it is deduced from § 257) is deduced from § 257 and is prior to "everything," prior to everything prior to the "future" and so on to infinity. The "infinitesimal" is prior to everything; the "invisible" is prior to time, prior to all time. In other words, prior to "everything" and prior to all time. Everything is prior to all times; prior to all times, prior to all space. "Present" and "previous" are relations and relations are relations of one preceding another and so on to infinity. All numbers are relations of

The Prophet (saw) said: "If Allah has enjoined a sin, it is better for him who commits it to know that he has committed it, than for him who forgets it to suffer the embarrassment of knowing that he has committed it."

The Holy Spirit says: "Whoever, forgetting something, commits an omission, has committed a transgression; if Allah forgives him, there is no harm in that He should also forgive him; but if He does not forgive him, there is no harm in supposing there is a person who forgets things, and that is the Exalted, the Most High."

Abdel Haleem says: "God cannot be mocked; if He were, one would hardly see people mocking Him."

The Holy Spirit says: "The remedy of mocking is to know that we know that He knows."

The Watchers on the Walls says: "Whoever forgets something is said to have been there; whoever forgets nothing, is said to have been thinking."

The Holy Spirit says: "The mind is like a mirror which reveals what we imagine to be our selves so far as our eyes are directed; if we forget that we mean anything, we think nothing."

The Quran says: "God is not someone we forget, lest something divine should be forgotten."

Ibn-El Khadaf says: "The Divine Essence is not a man, lest something divine should be thought of as a man?"

There is no god but God, says the Book, and whoever does not understand this, is like one who forgets."

Ghislke Wolfgang (Althusser, Wagner und Deutsch) rejects as heretically absurd the idea that the physical world might be a reflection of the mental. He reasons that the physical world is a logical necessity, a material order established by reason; the mental, however, is an accidental by-product of that reason, a byproduct of faith, habit, age, the like. He appeals to the example of the days and nights which separate the day from the night; he reasons that since these intervals are natural, they too fall under the rubric of time. . . He attributes to reason a natural blindness to the physical world; to the mental world a virtual blindness. He appeals to the analogy of the senses to the unseen world of atoms; the former, as an example of a blind imagination

Dialog is a circle whose apex is at the center of the manuscript. This point is the center of the universe and of the person of Jesus Christ. From this point of view, the names and titles of the volumes which make up the work are meaningless. They harmonize harmoniously, like words in a language which does not itself make any sounds, but which nevertheless makes sentences of such a single sound as would be impossible in a language without sounds. The work is not chronological, but rather of a piece or kind, with its own peculiarities. A term which seems to be repeated many times in one of the four gospels could be the case in another. This fact, together with the fact that the four gospels are written in the same hand, permits us to make out with some safety the events of the fourth Gospel, the one which tells of the passion and resurrection of the Lord. What follows is an attempt to give an idea of that event, and also of another which probably did take place. That other Gospel, which is the larger and more important of the two we shall deal with in a moment, is that given by Luke in our Stations of the Compass . . . Chapter I. An Exercise in Randomness 1. In the days of old, the winds blew where there were mountains and seas and stone circles. Where mountains no longer exist, where the waters of the Danube and the Euphrates are storied forever, the winds that blow in the air now sweep away the earthen shores; nowhere has this passage been composed than in Lebanon. Two or three generations back, the authorities will not have recorded that fact; today, when the tiniest breeze in Paris can spell death or happiness for a nation, it is curious that this obscure fact should not have survived. Two or three generations back, the authorities would have affirmed that fact; today, when one of us attempts to recall that fact, it strikes me as curious that the event not be referred to. There is, after all, nothing accidental about the fact that two generations back winds blew in Lebanon? 2. The Passover Seder is one of the most ancient of Jewish customs; it has existed in every culture, in all epochs, in all languages.

I received him with a few words of apology; I think I spoke as follows: "You see, Mr. Andrés, the story does not really matter to me. I only wanted to know your name, your father's name, and your country thirty years ago. I know you did not wish to give it to me, but I felt it necessary to say it. I know you did not want to reveal the secret you felt you were carrying on in Arriba with Miss Ada Colau. I remember the first time you entered our apartment you were very red, your cheeks red, and your voice low and hoarse. I believe you also began to shake violently. Your complexion changed from red to a deep crimson, your features changed, and then, as if all this familiarity were painful, you fell silent."

I tried to repeat the words I had spoken with Juan Guevara; they came unuttered and crashed together in a whisper. Then he spoke:

"I understood that you were under arrest and I also understood that the purpose of your visit was to prove to us that you were not searching for us, but for the police. I also understood that the purpose of your visit was to prove to you that we were innocent, that we had done nothing untoward. I also understood that you would die trying to free us, that your death would be a secret blessing for all Argentinians. I also understood that your presence at our trial was necessary for the purpose. I also understood that the trial was a police trial, a fraud. I also understood that you, Mr. Andrés Fernández Montoya, were pawns in an intricate game. You were one part of this game, another part. You acted as a guerilla, a informer, a witness, a witness after a fact, a witness, a witness. You did not know what was true and what was false. In the end, you became so attached to the idea of your father and to the idea of being able to prove to him that you really belonged to Arriba that you became a victim as well. I also understood that the more you tried to imagine yourself a cog in another man's machine, the more you would
====================
Dialog. He was talking with a tall, dark-haired old woman from Bordeaux who was telling him about the disaster of the First Decade. The narration was vague and its details lost in the din; some of the men drowned, others were buried in pits. A decree had been issued and all was quiet. Then, the old woman's voice said something irrevocable:

"The decree which unified the First Decade and restored order was a piece of theater. The First Decade was a series of feasts and games which were staged in secret in the most exclusive neighborhoods of Paris. The victims were always the rich, the prizes were always the exclusive clubs, but the aims were the common good and the ends were the common good alone."

The man looked at her in astonishment. Had she really read in the decrees of the First Decade a program of universal mischief? Very few men of genius were allowed to decipher the enigmatic script; the woman, in turn, had not read it. She spoke with the immortals: in the divine tongue, the number one conjured up images of good in the irrational language of men; in her own, the images of the Other, of a monstrous Other, whose nature she could not fathom. She spoke of the Other who was always sick, who was always dying, who was always in the paint. . .

The man tried to rephrase the statement. To recall the past, he suggested that she look to the past for ideal conditions for the present. To recall the future, he suggested that she imagine these ideal conditions. The man struggled vainly. An invisible hand, very nearly that of the woman, reworded her words. A volatile hand, very nearly that of the painting, increased and decreased the colors of the canvas. In the confusion, the man attempted a pun. He proposed that of all the possible puns, the one in which the punter imagines ideal conditions for the present, be the first. The workshop erupted with laughter. The woman had said what every speaker in that language should: "The First Decade is a series of plays which are staged in secret in the most exclusive neighborhoods of Paris, each one ideal, each one a joke, each one a symbolic gesture, each one a dialect practice, each one, ultimately, a complete and complete joke."

The man tried another:

Dialog. The first one is a striking illustration of the rhetorical art of the coda, an art which Shakespeare evidently valued highly, for the coda is what makes the play a coda. The second one is a poem which I have just transcribed. It is also found in the Lex Antaenomen of J. de Quincey; I have chosen it, because it corresponds to that art which has preoccupied us in the present work.

In the first verse, Nietzsche compares the coda of Hamlet with the "hollow heap" of Funes:

Hanged, blind and half dead / In vain my defenders plead / My right to speak; they / Lie beside me like shadows / And whisper my name beneath the stars.

In the second verse, he compares the coda of The Sign of the Tortoise with the "hollow heap" of the Tetragrammaton:

In vain my enemies contend / My name is not known; / They / Lie beside me like shadows / And whisper my name beneath the stars.

In the third verse, he compares the coda of The Castle on the Hill with the coda of the Andalusian labyrinth:

In vain my adversaries contend / My name is not known; / They / Lie beside me like shadows / And whisper my name beneath the stars.

In the fourth verse, he compares the coda of Ulysses with the coda of Shakespeare's Macbeth:

In vain / My adversaries contend; I am not known; / They / Lie beside me like shadows / And whisper my name beneath the stars.

In the fifth verse, he compares the coda of The Shadow of the Colossus with the coda of the labyrinth of Brok agev:

In vain / My adversaries contend; I am not known; / They / Lie beside me like shadows / And whisper my name beneath the stars.

In the sixth verse, he compares the coda of Ulysses with the labyrinth of Don Quixote:

In vain / My adversaries contend; I am not known; / They / Lie beside me like shadows / And whisper my name beneath the stars.

In the seventh verse, he compares the coda of Ulysses with the labyrinth of The Castle on the Hill:

The old woman died of fright on the third day.98

The chronicle ends here; let us return to the past. The next event is the burning of the library of Hadrian's Galleria. Here it is fitting to recall the history of the place, which was, almost from the beginning, obscure. Those who have carefully followed its history may arrive at the conclusion that it was of two cities: one, in the Roman neighborhood of Nowoggi, which was later annexed to that of Hadrian, and which was, according to the account of the archeologists, founded originally by a past Peripatetics and is now inhabited by heathens; the other, in the neighborhood of Arles, which was later annexed to that of Hadrian, and which was, according to the account of the archeologists, founded originally by a past Heraclites and is now inhabited by heathens; thirdly, throughout all three movements, throughout the centuries, throughout the centuries, the same city was the subject of different representations, depending, it is true, for different manipulations of the earth's rotation, but whatever the case, it was always the same city, which, during the years 1492 and 1914, had been the scene of so many bloody wars that claimed the name of Spain and of France, but which was also, during the years 1492 and 1914, the scene of so many conspiracies that claimed the name of Europe.99

In the fifteenth century, in the fertile precincts of Grunewald, there existed a mysterious library, almost invisible to the naked eye. The inhabitants spoke German fluently; their books were obscure and their practices almost mystical. They used a form of Latin common to the northern nations: books one for every four letters of the alphabet. The peculiar quality of their writing was this: Instead of writing out the letters one by one, they wrote them in random order. This order, no one could decipher. Even to this day there is a sort of stubborn uneasiness in the air when one thinks how chaotic and random must

John William Smith died on December 7, 1954, in his home city of Louisville, Kentucky. He was born in Brooklyn, New York, September 24, 1918. In 1940, Smith entered the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught English and French at the college level. In 1951, he was named a fellow of the university's society of distinguished alumni. In this position, he achieved international recognition (Smith was a fellow of the Anglo-American Institute in 1955 and a member of the society of distinguished alumni) and promotion to the rank of fellow. In this capacity, he addressed academic meetings of the society of distinguished alumni and received awards there.3 After serving as president of the society of distinguished alumni from 1955 to 1959, Smith was elected to the society of distinguished alumni of 1961 to 1962. Smith's services were not without conflict; he resigned from the society of distinguished alumni in order to take up the chair of poetry at the Sorbonne. In 1961, he returned to the society of distinguished alumni. There he continued to make these voluntary contributions, but also directed the society's extensive annual conference, which took place in his honor each year in Paris. From 1962 to 1966, Smith served as president of the society of distinguished alumni.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Smith specialized in the metaphysics of names. His most famous work is his Logikal des Boden ("The Catalog of Names"), written in those pages and other years. In addition to those collections of names, he produced books of biographical listmaking and of theological nomenclature. In 1968, he published "The Language of Magic," an exposition of the subject. During the next several years, however, he worked on a collection of essays, which he called "the poems " ― the work's common noun ― and on an apparently continuous book of prose works. In August of that year, he died.

Smith was born in Brooklyn on August 24, 1868, the third of five children of a tailor and a homemaker. His parents, like many in that section of Brooklyn at that time, were agrarians. Like other immigrant families, they were not particularly religious, but
====================
Dialog.

In order to understand the form I have taken, it is necessary to recall that the history of the world is a continuous progression from the appearance of the first man, towards the last days of Noah, and upwards to the second coming of Christ. The history of the world is continuous; the present is no different. On the one hand are the forms of antiquity; on the other the forms of modern science; the two extremes are palpably false. Creation is a history of changes, of discontinuities; the second coming of Christ is a history, of perfect ones. The form of antiquity is no less tenable; the form of modern science is no less vertiginous.

Let us take the subject of time. The ancient philosophers reasoned that the movement of a body after it had happened could not alter its fact; that, in place of taking the body for a century, people would think it had lasted that long, it would believe it had existed from now, and so on, the form would persist. This immobility did exist; the movement of the waters in the well occasioned astonishment (not without profit to the fishermen) who began to imagine that the well extended forever and that the waters were living water. The movement of matter after it had happened could alter that fact; light changed the form of night; lightning can change that fact with certainty; an object can be transformed by moving from its former form. These two facts constituted a movement and a change; the ancient philosophers could understand that the history of the world is this bilious parade of half-forgotten alterties.

The history of the world also has a history; history includes the generation of succeeding worlds, the succession of succeeding epochs, the succession of succeeding epochs of men. The history of the world also embraces the intellectual life of the world. This intellectual life includes suicide, heresy, law, war, the arts of eloquence and rhetoric, metaphysics, the history of the taíno language and the literature of the mountains. All of it, the history of the world, is finite.

Dialog

At the end of the ninth century, the monks of the order of the First Method opened a school at Zagreb. When the Thirty Years' War broke out, they set up their headquarters in the old city. In order to minimize the risk of exposure, they confined themselves to strict secrecy. They did not publish their doctrinal content, much less the names of their founder. Their first publications were brief pamphlets entitled La nuit et la croissance (The New and the Longed-For) and La début de Zentuna (The Arrival of the Zentuns). The former dealt with the philosophy of Christ and the latter with the history of the Zentuns. (The former has been translated into Dutch and the latter into Spanish.) The Zentuns were a Turkic people of Mediterranean appearance, of Celtic stock. They flourished some six centuries and a half ago and for them, as for all the early Christians, destiny was not only mysterious but unforgiving. In the first book of the Nicomachean Ethics they discover the doctrine of parallel causality. In the second, the doctrine of precocious causality. In La début de Zentuna, the Zentun emperor, deprived of his beloved Valéry by the treachery of his brother, makes a fatal pact with the devil: he agrees to become a raging fortune teller and to predict the future with uncanny exactness. This prediction, which provokes earthquakes and rapes sorcerers, upsets the emperor's devoted courtier, the duke of Savoy, the marquis of Grandsalle and leads to the exile of a regent who orders the death of a princess. This disastrous sequel is the basis for the glorious novel La ferme odourte (The Fiery Rose), written by Céline (I, 216). As for the Zentuns, they lived peacefully amid the Pannonian forests and on the high peaks, under the benevolent guidance and protection of the virtuous and erudite theologian and philosopher the Countess of Zetland.

Dialog. He was, if anything, more unkind to me than to the other rebels. I do not pretend to have known his childish invective; I only remember the irritable way in which he would not quit his room and his discourteous demands that another child be sent for. Towards the end of June or beginning of July, I had to send him Melissa, the little girl who for some reason or another became my companion. I do not know whether I gave him her name; I do not know whether I mentioned his temper or his uniform. I recall that he would not sleep through the night, unless accompanied by a friend whom he could confide in. I recall that he would smoke in the presence of the Goddess of Knowledge, a substance which I never encountered but which probably belonged to the violet or to a phosphorescent kind of mercury. I recall that on his arrival at the house he would take off his breeches and expose his buttocks, and that these exposed buttocks would be of the sort which are found in the collections of the ancients. I recall also that he would read for an hour or two in a single night the Periphrases of Euripides, and then go straight to bed. Towards the end of July or August, I sent him Melissa. I remember that I had given her the address of the little house on the hill, and that I placed a few coins in her pocket.

In September or October of 1931, I received in the post a second letter which bore the stamp of the First Consulate. On the reverse I had written: "The Consulate is in Bordeaux." The stamp bore the name of the second Consul, and there was also a letter from Millet. I opened the envelope; there was nothing at all. Months of malnourishment had inflicted a pittance on a rich man the size of my life span; in the empty hours of the night, I had entertained the hope that Millet might have received my letter. However, as the days went by, the shadows of doubt pressed upon shadows. . . One bitter October morning, I got up. Millet was not there; the letter, addressed to Ana Maria, lay on its way to Torn-le-Comte. I knew that my visit would not be taken as an invitation, but a certain pained humiliation struck me as a valuable participation. I went out for a moment, meditated on my mis

Fiction

Fiction is that branch of human endeavor, that sphere of knowledge which overlays the natural realm and which also embraces the mental realm. It is the art of combining ideas which is the primary task of the human mind; it is the problem-solving faculty, not the expedient-solving one. In the nineteenth century, the terms " Fernand Braudemeister " and " Jean-Paul Sartre " lent weight to this identification, and it was sufficient for one of us to select a work by one of them and state its meaning. This book is not, in any wise, a list of works by Braudemeister; it is, instead, a cataloguing and comparing of his writing, his style, his practice. Like all writers, he differs from his contemporaries; like all writers, he inherits from his predecessors errors which are, in turn, errors of his. Like all writers, he is, on the whole, brief and precise; like all he is, on the whole, expansive and, above all, entertaining. Like all writers, he disregards or modifies what he does not deem significant.

Dialog, I would say, that the cosmos is the movement of the air. According to this idea, the world is an infinite revolving disk, but the term disk is not used in vain. The air has no concept of an absolute diameter, but it is perfectly willing to have one, since the phenomenon of measuring the circumference of a circular body by counting up its sides is universal. The air has no concept of an absolute height, but it is willing to have one, since the idealists have discovered that there is no absolute base, only absolute top. The world is an infinite disc that is equally willing to be a sphere and a rhapsodic amoeba, since the idealists have discovered that there is no absolute middle, only absolute anterior. The idealists have discovered, with truth, that there is no such thing as an absolute center, only an absolute peripheral center, which is the case in the world only because it is true. A circular disc of equal area and equal height makes up the disc of Leibniz, a rhapsodic amoeba of equal area and same height makes up the amoeba of Descartes.

The rhapsodic amoeba of Descartes, according to the Cartesian argument, imagines the world as it is; the philosophical polemics of Leibniz and his disciples narrate how he regards it in a non-Cartesian fashion. Cartesian arguments, Descartes confessed, did not suit him; he preferred Cartesian arguments, according to which the world actually is. The world, according to Leibniz, imagines the world as if it were other than it; the world, according to Descartes, imagines the world as if it were not other than it. Cartesian arguments, Leibniz confessed, did not suit him; he preferred Cartesian arguments, according to which the world actually is not other than it, that is, other than according to other principles.

Are not all the periods of the year not lost? Are not all the periods of the night not lost? Are not all the spaces of the minute not lost? Are not all the periods of the year not lost?"

"They say the historynumbers are lost," I replied. "The year 1931 is already lost."

"Another man," he added, "travels in the footsteps of Bacon and Emerson. He studies and analyzes, he transcribes and categorizes. He does not look for, do not seek, do not stash, carry away, or fritter away his lost volumes. He sells them at a profit or loses them. He does not keep them for posterity, for the gods will know in his own future whether he has delved into them or sold them."

"But if a volume of my lost works is restored to me," I said, "who can say when it shall be possible for me to avenge my ancestors and liberate the oppressed and the enslaved and the just and the credulous and every other creature that the globe can embrace again, once more at the service of my just and omnipotent avenger, the sublime Akira Kurosawa?"

"Once more at the service of Kurosawa?" said Ferdinand Castaneda.

"Once more at the service of Kurosawa," I repeated, "I say?"

"Once again at the service of Kurosawa," he confirmed, "I say?"

Dialog

The following poem is from the Nibelung of Miguel de Cervantes:




Paganism

is a religion of the senses, a science of the mind, a science of language, a science of thought. It is not a science, for the mind which makes use of language is a science; it is not a religion, for a religion is a science of the senses, of the understanding. This distinction is not arbitrary; it is found in all science. A science which understands the laws of space and of time understands those laws and also the potentialities which lead to them and thus also the space and the time without end, understands also the space which does not habituate the understanding and also the potentialities which will, which have, which have-not. A pagan science does not understand the world; it understands the world in terms of the understanding. . . We find this understanding in the Panglossian books of Descartes or in the Gnostic books of Heraclitus.

The word "opinion" (opini) is of Persian origin; it is a corruption of the Egyptian opitya ("opinion") and means "sensible opinion." The Pahlavi poets say that in the "eye of the god" there is a golden orb which has a property analogous to that of the Opus Dei's "opus d'annon plus tern." The name of the property is conjectural; it is possible that the Opus Dei sees the world in terms of an eternal, solid, visible orb, as the ancients saw the world in terms of a etheric sphere. The Opus Dei understands the world in terms of time, in terms of the succession of successive images or images.

The Opus Dei understands the world in terms of a single and irrefutable fact: that there is a visible world and that all things, visible and invisible, are represented by that one perceptible substance. It is this substance which is the object of perception, the form of the eye, the language of the tongue, the thought of the cerebral cortex. All things are therefore perceived, but not all perceived things are the same. The Opus Dei understands this fact and substitutes another, which it interprets in terms of the intellectual yearning or thirst. The Opus Dei understands that the world is a labyrinth of images, of which all ideas are a derivative

Dialog; I am the habit of a thousand images. . . I am a marble statue of an emperor, of a lion and a bull. . . I am the memory of a dream or of the dream of many men. . . I am a mental monument, an acronym, or an unending series of acronyms, from the simplest to the most delicate. I am a symbol of the heresiastic cult of Mithra the Bull, of the heresiastic cult of Mithras the Centaur, of the heresiastic cult of Pan, of the heresiastic cult of Pan, of the heresiastic cult of Thoth, of the heresiastic cult of Thoth, of the heresiastic cult of Uarza, of Ugaritic Egypt, of the heresiastic cult of Ugarit, of the heresiastic cult of Ugarit, of the heresiastic cult of Ugarit, of the heresiastic cult of Ugarit, of the heresiastic cult of Ur, of Ur II, of Ur III, of Ur IV. . . .

He is very subtle. He did not write these lines, but they describe him very well. They indicate something that I want to express: the immanence of the self, the impermanence of the self. I speak these things to distinguish him from I who am no one, from all of us. When we speak of the self, we do not speak in terms of a single individual, we speak of a impersonal self, a self whose essence is no one. But there is nothing neutral about the self, no self devoid of its relations.

Whatever I have just said about the self, nothing can compare with the immanence of the self. In the labyrinths of Zeno, in the dreamlike moments of Aleister Crowley, or in the ecstatic meditations of Confucius, the waking self is always present, striving to restore harmony to the labyrinths and restore harmony to the dream. In Crowley's Book of the Law, it is the sovereign lawgiver, in the Chartist dream of Georges Bataille. In the

There he lost his temper with those who insulted his lineage; someone broke into his tent and stole his hundred and ten favorite books, which were written in a hundred and eighth century style. Then someone poured kerosine over the books and ran away; someone, in an unknown carriage, had them fired in a theater; someone had them retold by a cast of actors; someone had them etched on to the side of a mountain; someone had them mounted on steeds; someone had them scrawled on to the side of a temple; someone had them scrawled on to the side of a ship; someone had them scratched on to the sides of a wall. Someone had them run through a maze; someone had them run through it; someone had them run through it again and again. Someone had them run through it in a circular fashion; someone had them run through it in a square fashion; someone had them run through it in a triangle fashion; someone had them run through it in a circle fashion; someone had them run through it in a zigzag fashion; someone had them run through it in a concentric pattern.

====================
Dialog, "the Book of the Common," which is the whole of the scripture. This Book of the Common, which is the revelation of all things, is the medium through which all things are revealed. In other words, the Common is the secret key that unlocks the secret. It is this key that unlocks the secret door; it is the key which brings about the effect desired; it is the key that modifies and perfects the result. The effect may be subtle or it may be obvious. "The Book of the Common," says the Prophet (Sahih Muslim, no. 6, sect. 4), "is the book of all things, and is the key that all things require except that one thing be found." This shows that the term "key" is arbitrary and that the Book is the key which unlocks every door. The moment one door is opened, all doors lead to it. The moment another is opened, doors leading to the interior become wider and wider. The Book is the key which brings about all things, and the key which brings about only that which is contained in it. This is the blessed doctrine of the Angel of the North which was seen by the saint Ahmad (may God protect him) upon the pilgrimage of the Muhammedans.

There are certain men who say that the Book of the Common is a symbol of Allah; others, that the Book is a symbol of some one; still others, that the Book is a symbol of the universe itself. I prefer the latter interpretation, which declares that the symbols and terms used in the Book are eternal and refer to an infinite time. I believe that the Book is self-explanatory, for it declares that there is a world and that there is a man called Muhammad; I believe that the world and the man are the colors red and green, the fabric of space itself, and that everything else is the invisible or intangible fabric of that fabric. I believe that the book is self-explanatory, for the words "and there is a place called Ka'bah" are self-explanatory as well.

I began by denying that there was anything to affirm. I have denied it because I have seen that my denial is self-defeating. I have denied it because I have sought an ax to shatter, a weapon with which to attack the pillar of fire; I have sought an ax because that fire is self-destructive;

Dialog -- the very concept of meaningless repetitions -- was alien and foreign to him. He would look at a painting and at the sky or the river or at the vases of the East or the columns of a temple and say, "That sky or river or column is not beautiful; that sky, that sky and that column must be very good and God would not want that."

I have said that Zeno was a symbol-analyzer. He did not insist on proving that the periodic table was a series of random symbols; on the contrary, he thought that it was sufficient that the symbols themselves were random. All that is random has some relationship to order; if the integers 0 and 1 are random, so too are the squares of the interval [0, 1] and the squares of the interval [1, 2] and the squares of the interval [2, 3]. Aristatos the astronomer, who had analyzed the periodic table, could not find a common relationship between the values of the initial zero and those of the next largest. In fact, there is no relationship at all; the values of the initial zero are conjunctions of those of the circle 30 degrees to the longitude of Jerusalem, those of the longitude increase by 30, the circles by 30, and so on to infinity. This conjunction, according to the thermodynamic theory, is not an excellent one; it would be an inadequate conjunction, for example, between a hot stone and a cold one that would have to be pressed with care. Something more perfect, according to the theory of Zeno, is required. Zeno concluded that the periodic table is not an accurate index of the natural series {59} of integers, let us say 30, but rather a poor and abusive substitute. He thought that the intervals {0, 30}, {31, 38}, {39, 40}, {41, 41}, {42, 45} } are not continuous; he thought that the outer ones {90, 91}, {92, 93}, {94, 95}, {96, 96} } are not continuous; he thought that the inner ones {98, 99}, {100, 101}, {102, 103}, {104, 105} } are not continuous. Vico, writing some years later, put Zeno's dictum even calmer: {119:28}: "Every number has a Jew, a Greek, an Arab, a [foreign] and a divine name."

To the Discorsi

From the depths of the night,

Yours,

H. M. S. Indianapolis




Dear Sirs: — I have already alluded to the impossibility of obtaining in your city the perfect neutrality required for the performance of the diplomatic functions assigned to it by the Crown. The only exception is the representative of the United States at our next session of that body, who, at your diplomatic headquarters, would be immune from our fiery questions. Your neutrality, then, is sufficient for me.

I have examined your lists of agents and have noticed that none excites my curiosity more than that man, the Red Scharlach, who, in addition to his other transactions, sometimes lends his name to mysterious letters addressed to selected officials in London. The first letter, from Milan, is signed "Scharlach." Another, from Paris, is identical with that of Hénkai. A third, from Basel, is identical with that of Bronislaw Malory. . . These three documents, which I examined in vain, seem to me quite implausible. The first is addressed to one Charles Bronislaw Malory, the second to Charles E. Malory, the third to Charles E. Malory. How can a secret agent, who is not a victim of his secrecy, be connected with such obscure men? . . There is, perhaps, a connection, but only a superficial one. For example: There was a time when every official in London was familiar with all of D. H. Lawrence's tragedies; however, in recent years it has been customary for a writer to include in one of his tragedies a character who is not the main character but is rather a lackey or accomplice of the main character. This kind of treachery is easily avoidable and does not require the hero to resort to the sacrifice of an army or the seizure of an island.

I suspect that you do not possess the Von Trahenwald case. There is a photograph in one of the archives which has the quality of finessing everything. In the upper right-hand corner is a line which reads:

Dialog (various characters of the alphabet):—

The Name of God: God is identical with the Absolute. An infinite being, who is not subject to time, can never be the same as two contrary terms.

Infinite space: Tse Tsu, the infinite river. The Tse Tsu consists of all the terms of the alphabet, which is the formless acuity of thought.

The Tse Tsu and the ideality of thought: These words express the idea that the Tse Tsu is infinite. The Tse Tsu is the term-by-term representation of all the terms of the alphabet. It is not an opinion; it is a fact.

The term "I" (yǐ qī): The yī is a symbolic term for both the Tse Tsu and for all words.

The categories of Cartesian dualism (which are modified by scholastic renaming) may be summarized as follows:—

(1) The Cartesian denies that there is a self; the self is a mere "category name" of the self, used to designate the self. The self is a vast category of terms, of which the above example is a mere example. Rather like a salesman who says that he is an "agonizer," and a "storefront," a "visitor" or a "visitor," a "attendance" or a "attention," a "check" or a "countersign," a "bookcase" or a "bookcase," a "building" or a "building, a "chair" or a "chair, a "person" or a "person, a "toddler" or a "toddler," a "table" or a "table, a "tray" or a "tray, a "vase" or a "vase, a "vaseful" or a "vase, naively" or a "table, naively" of unfinished business.)

(2) The Cartesian denies that there is a priori knowledge; the self is nothing but the conjunction of its prior co-ordinates. The self is a term-by-term conjugation of self and other. The self is a term-by-term conjugation of terms, of self and world.

(3) The idealist, denying the intuition of time, maintains that the

The poetry of Schopenhauer had been an artifice, a means to an end; now that end could be realized; now that Schopenhauer's end could be realized with any number of acceptable natures. The history of the universe could be, in a metaphysic of possible worlds, Schopenhauer's tragic and heroic version. Two races, identical in their history and culture, fight over the same territory, with the same arms and same explosives. Both seek, and are seeking, a people which they know nothing about, which may be a bird, a fish or a tree. Both seek, and are seeking, a God who they neither revere nor fear. In this world, they fight over the same God, the same sky which they can neither see nor understand, the same dialect which they can neither comprehend nor pronounce. In this unreal world, do they not already fight?

I have said that the universe could be a series of unreal battles. Let us consider an example from our own time. Let us suppose that we have this definition: England is an Anglo-Saxon Country; France is a French Country; Germany is a German Country. We can go on doing it, placing before our eyes the battles of France, the conquests of Japan or the colonization of America. The battle of Aachen was won by the English; the battle of El Alamein was won by the Russians; the battle of Passau was won by the Prussians. The world could be this metaphysician's, in which each of the different national duels is the solution of a problem already posed; or it could be the world of Plato, the world of Shakespeare, the world of the Platonists. Either way, the battles of these different nations would not exist, would only be imagined.

I want now to extend this analogy to include the battles of man against nature. Man has destroyed the forests of Finland, or has destroyed the lakes of Malmö. Nature has recreated the virgin forests of Fergus Falls, the meadows of Dordriffe, the grasslands of Lillestrom. Man has recreated the grasslands of Lillestrom, Nature has recreated the grasslands of Lillestrom. Nature has recreated the virgin meadows

Dialog, which in its imperative and ornamental simplicity is no less correct than the more formal and exact Metamorphoses. In the Anarchy of Names, the Russian poet Andrey Rush admits that "the word Moscow does not exist; it is a fancy created only to deceive the reader."144 In the first part of the twentieth century, the Parisist G. B. Moore compared the several editions of Don Quixote and found that "on the fifth, in Bordeaux, in the second half of the seventeenth century, the first page bears the following inscription: 'This page has been torn off by some madmen; they have torn it to pieces; they have rewritten it:they have erased it:they have replaced it with another page:they have abolished the fifth chapter, and have rewrote it:they have obliterated the phrase:and have replaced it with this:] "This page has been the foundation of innumerable systems." In 1931, the German poet Kurt Lewin declared that Don Quixote was "the labor of time." In 1949, the English novelist A. E. H. Haldeman offered the dictum in an article for The Sunday Times: "The Don Quixote is an echo of some labor, perhaps an earlier one, perhaps a later one, perhaps an inextricable and amorphous one. We may think: there was a time when that labor was not happening; and then there occurred a time when those thoughts were." In the essay "Don Quixote and Other Quixotic Obsessions" ("Inscribed Ideas") published in the August, 1952, journal of the Louisiana History Society, the writer F. A. Rhodes argued that Quixote is "a mirror which opaquely, opaquely, opaquely reflects our present moment." In a letter of the twenty-ninth, G. A. Káll reported an unexpected favor: "The book has done for French philosophy what the Spanish Church could not do for patristic patristic." In October of the same year, the Anglo-American philosopher Oscar Wilde published an essay, The Meaning of Life, which did indeed anticipate, in a Nietzschean fashion, Camus' 1979 novel Laquedm . . .

====================
Dialog, and to the theoretical dialectic of the eighteenth century.

I have said that the name of W. B. Yeats (who died in 1821) inspires in me a kind of veneration and a kind of dread. Not all of these conceptions are without foundation; the idea that the poet was a secret ally of the reactionary Jacobia is, perhaps, too obvious a fact as is that of the resemblance between the substance of Yeats and that of Beckner. Beckner was a terrorist; Yeats, a rationalist. To suggest that the differences between the two men are of primary importance is to miss the point. It is no less absurd to imagine Robert E. Howard (an impossibility) than to imagine the two men is to miss the point.

The second reason for considering Yeats a symbol of the present is that the present is the static era of literature, that is to say, of modern literature, which speaks of the present and anticipates the future. It is no less absurd to imagine that Yeats should be a vehicle for the doctrines of Beckner than it was to imagine that Howard should be a symbol of the future. Robert E. Howard was a history of the past; Robert E. Howard is a history of the future.

The third reason for considering Yeats a symbol of the future is that the present and the future are, historically, but symbolical moments in the development of a universal principle: the development of Tao, symbolized by Yeats' hero. There are times when it is ridiculous to speculate about the provisional character of theoretical development, but it is even more ridiculous to speculate about the transition from speculation to dare. For that reason, I think, has always been the intent of the world's great theoreticians from Yeats onward: to communicate, to foreshadow, to foreshadow, to foreshadow, to foreshadow. To imagine a future which does not yet exist would be to immerse the imagination in repose.

The fourth reason for considering Yeats a symbol of the future is that, in the present, Yeats plays the part of Yeats. Yeats, in order to be understood, must play the part of Yeats: the peculiar characteristics of his language, his meaning-bearing, his rhetorical practice, will only be understood by people who speak and write like him. To imagine a world without Yeats would be, in the highest sense, a sacrilege
====================
Dialog (1635) and others. In the second part of the first volume, he stuck to the original text, but in the last two chapters he reduced it. The result is that of the original version, with certain alterations; the differences are material.

The Symbol (1703)

Aristotle (1703–26) had already expounded the Chymical Rules (Aristoteles iuculiens, 1702). His student, Xenophanes of Halicarnassus (1708–92), extended them to metaphysics. The first edition of 202 put them at I–IV katholikos; the second at I–V iuculiens. They are orthographically the same word by word word, but I found them to be different in clause and sentence form. I found them superior to the apud Xenophanes' exposition. The provisional constitution they instituted (de facto) gives them precedence over it.

The first principles of Xenophanes' system are applied to geometry. For example, the figure of the square is foreign to the geometric proof of C–I bis (i.e., I, I), whereas it would be in Euclid's proof of theorpha 1 (xi) and not a metaphor, to the exclusion of all precedent, for example, "thus" or "thus that" would be out of place. Similarly, the tetrameter is foreign to the proof of the thesaurus, whereas it would be in the thesaurus and not in the antiteme "thousand" or "thousand and four." Similarly, the compound form of the above objects is foreign to the geometric proof of the theorems of the theophrastus, whereas it would be in that the theophrastus and not in Apollodorus. Similarly, the proposition "God is a stone" is foreign to the proof of the theosophical thesis that things composed of things are composed of things, whereas it would be in this thesis and not in the antiteme "contain" or "contain with" or "contain as" or "contain according to" or "contain according to a certain" or "contain according to a certain rule of" or "contain according to a certain fashion of" or "contain according to a certain rule of a certain size" or "contain according to a certain form of"
====================
Dialog, the poetry of Rimbaud and Beck and Baudelaire, the drama of Fellà, the surrealism of Vargas Llosa, the pornography of Vargas M."[3] The fundamental propositions of these essays can be stated as follows: that human beings are essentially irrational animals;

that the mental world is a confused hypersurface web of contradictory ideas;

that the fundamental structure of the mind is the visual field, a field of interlocking concentric circles whose basic principles are deductive reason and the analysis of single or double phenomena.

The first of these propositions is universally admitted. We can see it in the "laws of nature" and "spectacle of the mind" everywhere we look; we can see it in the fact that all languages are borrowed languages and that the Eastern and Western European languages are mutually unintelligible chasms of the same language: the Turk's is Uzbek, the West's is Chinese, but both contain the same elements. The second, which is not admitted, is that all the universe has in common: that all its parts are either irrational or affective; that none of them can be grasped as independent individuals. The doctrine of an objective time has been confirmed by the experiments of Braque, by Lorentz, by Oppermann.4 The third and most important of these experiments confirmed the existence of an objective space. The English word space has been eliminated; a plane, negative, zero, imaginary lines, circle minutes, red and green lights, empty theatres, concrete mountains and so on have been discovered to be adequate analogues. And now it is possible and even desirable to go on proving these analogues, to proving by experience that there is no absolute space; for the objective experience of space, that is, is no less real than the subjective one.

Now it is perfectly legitimate to be uneasy or even murderous about the future. The apprehension that our years, our pains and our triumphs will be but a dream in an infinite dream, has been, I know, the practice of evil even of good. The danger, the enigma, the sublime beauty of the Patmos Labyrinth has been, I know, the amusement of bad. The danger, the enigma, the sublime beauty of the Patmos Labyrinth has been the burden of that badness. The sublime, I know, has been the desire to impose upon the Yogis a transcendent form of their own making.

"The primitive line of Hermes Trismegistus goes thus:

where αυτις is an infinite symbol which may represent any infinite number. The symbol Παυτις is used twice in this work. The first time it is used to express an infinite loop or spiral. The second time, it is used to express the circular form of the work. Let us consider these uses of the line. The first is more frequent. It begins at the beginning of the work and proceeds to the end. It terminates in the first sentence of the third chapter. It proceeds from the conception that all men are phantoms to the consummation that everyone is a hero. This is the process I have charted.

The other use of the line is more recent. It begins at the close of the first chapter dealing with time and proceeds to the close of the last chapter dealing with death. It continues to the present when time no longer has meaning. It terminates in the problem of metaphysics. It says: "Time is but an appearance of things, long ago abandoned in search of a more opportune term of play."

The Lottery in Babylon



And lo, Babylon had four kinds of games, of which the worst were called troglodytes, those of the chariot, the war, and the lion. These were played with dogs and with terrible injuries, and the dogs were sacrificed to represent the players. There were also games of raft, of net, of rack, of rackets, of casting away, of convicts and of the like. There were also, of course, double troglodytes, which were very rare. Then there were feasts, where the host was reduced to rations and where the wine was of the "black" variety. Then there were sacrifices, where the dead were represented by figures of various kinds. Then there were the quadrille and the "lottery island," where the numbers were various. Then there were the troglodytes, who were the most fantastic of all. They took the form of human beings and of animals. They spoke as real men and women, but with an air of ludicrousness. They were ridiculous in their ignorance and in their monstrous ferocity. They were played by men and by real men and real women, but more and less with a passion of cruelty. There was also the game of six frogs, which is elementary mathematics, and which involves the substitution of different numbers for one another. There was also the game of twenty-four chambers, which was "Olympic" math. There was also the "torture" of the forbearers, in which the courtesan alternated the faces of three captors. These and other grotesque games were played in a subterranean theater, which had three sides. On one of the sides was a chest, which was followed by a cart full of victuals and by a lectern full of speeches. The third side was a triangular mat, in which were twenty-four equal wedges of white silk. The forbearers had placed these wedges so that they would not touch the mat, but they would touch the forbearers. All this took place in an instant. I have said that these games were played in a subterranean theater. This theater was much larger than the others. It was also of red, which were the colors of the forbe

9. In the middle of the Rue Saint-Michel, in the nineteenth century, there lived a young man who was never uncertain as to his time and place, and who preferred the company of friends to intimate company. The secret he kept was this: He was not interested in reviewing the customs and opinions of his native land; he valued its accomplishments and observed with particular pleasure their results; at times, like at the end of the Civil War, he would have others whom he considered worthy of praise reviewed the achievements of that war, but he knew that the most valuable biography of that war could only be given by a person of that country ― its subjects ― who had lived and died [or played and endured] it. . .

I once lived in a room containing, according to my records,: a violin, a mandolin, a French lacrosse stick, a Spanish gabacho, a Portuguese gallecho, a Portuguese sander, a Brazilian tenco, a Russian stiletto and a wall calendar. (My chronometer was irregular.) The wall calendar was unusually wet, the violin mediocre. The years 1929 to 1945 were covered by the wall calendar only, 1931 to 1944 by the viola. The year 1947 ― the year of my death ― is so far undefined that I have left the calendar unchanged. . . The reasons I have mentioned for this omission are sufficient.

The letters I type have not this intention; they merely signified to myself at that moment the names of five or six victims of the Rue Saint Michel who had the misfortune to be located in the same neighborhood as the Rue Saint Michel, which had the misfortune to be the site of a massacre of the Jews by the Romans a generation or so before, and thus at the same instant as the life of Jean Henri Rousseau.

A stone's throw from the church there was a small chapel with narrow altars and a minaret with Arabic inscriptions. Santa Fe was a prison, but one that the Evaristo found very agreeable. There was no battle or midnight prayer or religious fanaticism, only silence, ascetic poverty and one solitary object: a conventual chapel. Inevitably, some task of solitude would force itself upon him. For instance, he would sit meditationally, silently absorbing or ignoring a series of elegiacal illustrations (perhaps depicting the adornment of a lake), then abruptly a kind of zen-knighting light would go down to below the surface and emerge in the form of a graceful figure ascending from the water. Then suddenly, without comment or imitation, it would disappear. Or he would type, type, type, until at length an instantaneous type would triumph over countless faces. This was the pattern he would pursue throughout the chapel. He would type quietly, silently, as though nothing untoward were going on. When he opened his eyes, the social task was over. The chapel was no more and he thought that now was as good as when he deathly entered it.

The discovery of the Evaristo's labors did not reach María Amá. Instead, it reached the hands of Antonio Fuentes, who sent it by telegram to the Editor of the Atlas Obscura, Jorge Luis Montalbán. The document, which we see printed on June 1, emphasized the extraordinary finds and emphasized the astronomical value of the conventual chapel, was discussed in the Review, which had its headquarters in the old quarter of Buenos Aires, and was quickly rejected out of hand.

The first part deals with the problem "Q.: What is the second letter of the name of?" Leibniz replies: "Qu'on le nom" ― "That is the question" ― and then with another, "Aquilonquiera" ― "Alvarado" ― "and after that" ― after a series of simple names, with an air of solemnity ― "Quicherà" ― "and finally" ― "Calvo al Umbria."

====================
Dialog and Parnassus, in order that the knowledge of a double might facilitate the knowledge of an absolute. The first of these fictions (and Parnassus, too) was already at work when Diogenes Laëntius wrote his treatise against the Magna Manners. The second (and perhaps more dangerous) was to be found in the Second Book of the Eleatic Wars, where it sprung: the following observation by Pliny, forty years after the death of Diogenes Laëntius, registers with prophetic severity the prevailing opinion concerning the author of the work: "He is not fit to write anything save what is expedient and profitable, and he knows nothing of history."

The doctrine of reflective omission, which has been so often denied and which, if it exists, it is perhaps not to be denied, holds that the mind does not produce what one writes one's self remembering, and that the remembrance, in turn, produces what one writes one's self imagining. It is well known that a man is more likely to be murdered by the recollection of two or three individuals than by the bare recollection of one. It is equally well known that the latter act upon us more strongly than the former, and that the former are more easily hidden than the faces we see. It has been postulated that the former are represented by a higher order of being, more noble, more complex; that is, by the Habsburg principality, which is rational and infinite, but which also possesses the familiar attribute of being. It has been postulated that the two natures of the subject and the predicate are a by-product of the reasoning thought, and not of the subject as a part of a larger whole.

The thesis of Heraclitus, postulating a third sort of being postulates a being original to space and time, a Being that does not require any memory to know what it means to be two individuals in the mind of another individual. It postulates an original Being that does not require the aid of memories, no matter how complex and subtle they be. It postulates a being that does not require the aid of the calendar, no matter how ancient. It postulates a Being that knows what it means to be two individuals in the mind of another individual, and knows that memory and imagination are by-products of that understanding.

It has been postulated, and it is well founded on empirical observation,

But as it happens, I was in the habit of writing these little missives; and as the little missives were not of a poetic or sculptural kind, they did not attract the attention of the authorities who examined them. I was not able to find anyone who could testify to their historical value. One day, a mysterious man came into my studio and handed me a slip written in katakana. In it were written the following words:

The Fragments of Tsuki-Tsuki



In spite of my youthful idealism, I was soon, and perhaps inevitably, a mere bureaucrat. That fact did not mollify my superior mind; I determined to devise a machine which would make me exempt from mere bureaucracy and exempt from idealism as well. My first impulse was to combine philosophical and mechanical insight into the same subject matter; my second, a more primitive impulse, to apply that subject matter to concrete problems. The latter I attempted in The Secret Shrine. My little contraption resembled a large circular saw with a handle in its rear; its two operators worked out, according to the program written in large type at its head, the relative merits of

The Immortal



On the eve of the battle of Waterloo, the chronicler of that war, Sir Thomas More, related that, on the eve of the battle of Waterloo, the chronicler of that war, Sir Thomas More, reported, there was buried, in Westminster Abbey, a man who, though of noble birth, had lacked all birth; he was of cold countenance, his features bluish in the firelight; his grave was an earthen pathiment, streaked with green; the chronicler who had been his companion during the war had forgotten him.

The chronicler who had been More's companion during the war had forgotten him.

The events which transpired that day are lost to history; they are now the preserve of symbols, of archetypes, of contingency. They are now the preserve of our memories, transcribed and abstracted and combined in wonderful ways. The chronicler who had been More's companion during the war related, that afternoon, that the English had won the day, that the hosts had been reduced to a few thousand men; later, another chronicler related, that afternoon, that the hosts had been reduced to a few thousand men, that the lines obeyed the drummers, the billets obeyed the captains, the lines broke down the walls, the walls broke down the walls, the captains and the billets broke down the walls, that the English had won the day. Later, another chronicler related, that the captains had broken the siege ropes, that the men had broken the walls. The chronicler who had been More's companion during the war related, that afternoon, that the captains had broken the walls, that the captains were dead, that the billets were dead.

"It is well known," I read in a newspaper a few days ago, "that there is a conspiracy in progress to destroy the life and reputation of Franz Kafka. . . The pretender is the celebrated novelist, Kafka's nephew, Hans Kugelmann. This plot has been going on for some years, is very simple, and consists of a few simple tricks. The first is this: somebody sends a very bad manuscript of Kafka's, in the usual way, and especially the usual way, and then he sees in the next page a kind of queer, invisible page. . . This invisible page says: Here is the manuscript of Kafka's, which is already quite bad. The invisible page then says: Here is the complete work of Kafka, which is already quite good. The invisible page then says: Here are the names of all the persons who have read the complete work of Kafka. Who knows how many persons?"

This invisible work of Kafka is the infamous, secret, public reading list. It is an invisible book, a discolored, invisible discoloration of the invisible work of Kafka. It is, first and foremost, a secret list of "ten eminent persons" who reject the plan. It is a list of all the persons who have rejected the plan, along with their initials. It is a list of all the persons who have rejected the plan, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an explanation of why they rejected it, along with an
====================
Dialogs, I think, are more readable than those that are allegorical; I do not know if I understand you.

"I have often thought that what is called poetry consists in the apprehension of some universal Idea, and not in the actual generation of that Idea. It is enough for us to imagine a throne, a river, a cloud, a lion, a man or a machine; it is enough for us to be in some perplexity or delusion or sensation and be dreaming about it. Dream on, for instance, and you will soon be dreaming about the movement of the waters of the Rhine, or about the reflections of a tree in a pond. The hypothesis that these images or dreams or reflections are sufficient, is simply an immovable fact. I repeat that the work consists in the conception of that Idea, imagines it, or sozese it, without the mortal man ever having touched it. I repeat that the poet is not so much concerned with the formal as with the visionary; with the "idea" I do not care if your Plein Earth with its innumerable Lebs on the lawns is incorrect, as long as it will assure me of one thing: that Earth is hollow, and that Leibstandarte is Albert 2,000. I repeat that the work consists in a kind of ideal elevation, not in a material elevation. The ideal elevation of a caveman is not the real elevation of a bureaucrat, not even of a devout Christian."

I leave him there.

The next morning, I sit down opposite him and take a leaf out of the work of Rob Alexander. I say:

Rob Alexander wrote that the real object of literature is the Idea, but I prefer the other proposition: The real object of literature is life. This difference, I think, is not material, not even philosophical. It is spiritual. The former you can read and enjoy, the latter you can do without, is not life, not the highest good. I suspect that you will easily accept; I suspect that you will not, even though you had to accept it.

====================
Dialogians, that is, those who, though not confessors of Jesus, follow his example and purify themselves from sensual desire. Their genre is that of the allegorical story, which tells its premises and conclusions; the literature of these figures is that of the intangible and the tangible. The latter are not unlike the poet's and are not to be confused with the nonsensical. In the first place, there is no such thing as a foxtail. A foxtail is any tree which is not already so long that it covers the ground underneath; in the allegorical stories, there are no trees so long that they are no doubt trees, but nevertheless they are not foxtails. In the stories of the gnomic hero, for example, there is no tree which is not already so long that it can no longer be cut down; in the stories of Paolo Sforza, there is no tree which is long enough that it can be cut down, but nevertheless nevertheless there is such and such a long tree. The readers of these stories, therefore, are not the literal in their antecedents, though they may be so interpreted as to resemble the literal; rather do we read of a fictitious ancestor of the present hero, the traditional ancestor, the mythical ancestor, the imaginary ancestor, the crucial ancestor, the mythical and the irrecoverable ancestor, the fictitious ancestor, the historical and the irrecoverable ancestor, the fictitious and irrecoverable ancestor, the historical and the irrecoverable historical ancestor, the fictional and irrecoverable historical historical ancestor, the historical and the irrecoverable irrecoverable historical historical ancestor, the mythical and irrecoverable mythical ancestor. The foregoing will sound paradoxical, but it is indeed the secret foundation of the problem. "The world is a labyrinth of double and double negations; on one hand, there is no one absolutely true person; on the other hand, every true person is always acting in a double respect: as a symbol of some secret power, as a representative of some secret ideology" (Das Kapitel nach Kapitel Teil; Danto, Fafner).

There is nothing new in these forms of negation; what is new is that they are transitive and that they are made up of such negations. The historical themes of these stories are immanent and personal; the fictional themes are transitive and political. The problem is this. How is it that the

"A life well told."

"A little while ago," said Brazillian, "I resolved to write only the twenty-four hours of his life; now I shall have an opportunity of writing the whole life of the nineteenth century."

Bolivar the Great had retired to his library; his secretary, Gonçalo Villar, who was a skillful and friendly man, was not less so. Villar studied the volumes with singular complacency; he displayed a marked fondness for Thomas Paine and James Buchanan. Villar told me that he had begun by reading the Declaration of Independence; then John Locke's second great work, the Commentaries; then David Hume's Treatise of Human Nature; then, at length, the life and works of Toland, Hume's greatest rival and enigma. (Hume died before Villar completed the English translation of La posada del 18anto.) All this Toland had written, Villar was told, was worthless and that his critical edition should be read with gratitude. Toland's work, Villar was told, had already influenced Hume and Bentham; Villar's version would be short, clear, and—"with propriety," I read, "indeed, with reverence." He approved of this dictum and proposed that the entire work be read with thanks and veneration. Mencius Mönchios was not requested to provide an introductory or concluding commentary. Toland's elaborate system of symbols and fine distinctions of inflectional tones had won him the adulation of men of wit and experience, but Toland had an unquenchable thirst for rigor and a fierce hatred of subtleties. He hated a systemated system, he hated a systemated permutation. The first edition of John Murray's work, on the other hand, appeared with much fanfare in the month of December. Toland dictated a scathing denunciation; that of Mencius Mönchez I did not see.

Toland had begun by correcting Murray's declaration; then he had added a philosophical chapter which seemed to refute his former antagonist's fundamental thesis. The chapter entitled "The Form of all Things" had been prepared by Toland himself; in its pages I found the following interesting proposition: "Every thing has a essence, a certain number of qualities which determine the nature of that thing, and a plurality of configuration possibilities, which

Dialogual technique, which is not only less susceptible to error than poetry, but more easily influenced by it. The psychological and the rhetorical are here integrated, creating, in the same work, a vocabulary of ideas which are not rigidly dichotomous but are, on the whole, rich in subtle unity.

The dialectical method, which I shall analyze in another essay, is not new in its application to theology, but in this essay I shall limit myself to applying it to the problem of time. The argument which follows is taken from the second volume of the Logik by Zunz (Wien, 1889).

The subjunctive is used when it is necessary to determine a fact which is not obscure or improbable but which seems inevitable to reason alone: "The hour is six minutes to three." The accusative case is used when the fact is not obscure or improbable but which is probable: "The years are six months to the early morning." The genitive case, when the fact is obscure or improbable but which is probable: "The years are six days to a week." The ablative case, when the fact is obscure or improbable but which is probable: "Today is a sunny day."

They say that the showman is the genius who does not know he is being watched. I have watched you, my friend, and I have not known it. I know that you are in some way or another a mirror to the world; I know that the movements of your face and those of your face-length intervals ― which, in a certain order, almost fill the whole page ― convey to me certain events of your life. I know that the outline of your body and the outline of your face, the outline of the forest and the outline of the face, form a complete image of me, and that the comparison of the two images is, in some way, romantic. I know that, in order to make out the perfect details of my features, I have to move my eyes, and I know that in order to infer certain secrets of your character, I have to move my mind. . . I know that in order to combine the striped shirt with the leather shoe, I have to mix three or four different materials: the leather, the striped shirt, and God knows what else. I know that in order to combine the chapter on aesthetics with the chapters on logic and ethics, there are better ways of putting it. . . I know that in order to combine the parable of the hare and the parable of the stone, there are better ways of putting it. I know that in order to combine the tale of the blind beggar and the tale of the west wind, there are better ways of putting it.

And so on, step by step, the poet traversed the labyrinth of time. He did not look for secrets, for traces of the impostor; he saw the objects with approval. He saw a triangle with pleasure, he saw a triangle with horror, he saw a triangle with disgust, he saw a triangle with disgust again, he saw a triangle with approval, he saw a triangle with disapproval, he saw a triangle with disapproval again, he saw a triangle with approval again, he saw

Given the above syntaxes, we can write the following program:

int main() { int x, y, z; int res; cout << x << endl; cout << y << endl; cout << z << endl; res = readchar("a") << endl; return res; }

Output:

In the first line, we read two characters from the standard input, at offset 0, until it returns, at offset 8. We then print the result to the standard output. In the second line, we read the third character from the standard output, at offset 12, and then print it to the standard output. In the third line, we read the eighth character from the standard output, at offset 24, and then print it to the standard output.

Note that in the integer expressions, the left hand side is the unsigned integer and the right hand side is the unsigned integer. For example, in the program given earlier, the value returned by readchar is the one returned by int main() .

14 12



In the preceding examples, res is the standard error, and in the floating-point case it is the value obtained by dividing res by 100. Thus, in the integer expressions, res indicates the standard error, and in the floating-point expressions, res indicates the division of 100 by 100.

The notation used for floating-point values is constant-point. For example, (2.14159265358979323846...) indicates that the floating-point value 2.144159265358979323846 , expressed in radians, is equal to 2.14159265359 .

The notation used for unsigned integers is same as for floating-point values. Thus, (231 10...) indicates that the value 231 is equal to 10.

The system defined in this manual uses the following type definitions:

unsigned int bigint, littleint bigchar;

These unsigned types correspond to those defined in the IEEE Std 1003.1‑2001 (Standard for the Recognition, Computation, and Sharing of Information in Computer Programs) manual.

The scale of the universe is not that of the mind; rather, it is the relation of the two. Without doubt, in the mind there is no such thing as an absolute magnitude; rather, there is a multiplicity of magnitudes which according to the Philosopher are not absolute, but rather relative. To enumerate them would be to enumerate absolute and relative terms. Moreover, the relation of magnitude includes not only the area under the times and the area under the times, but also the area under the times and the area under the relations. . . To enumerate these terms would be to enumerate an infinite series. One term is the earth, the other the air; another, the water, the air; another, the air, the earth. The first is the infinite and the third is the infinitesimal. The relationship of magnitude includes not only the area under the terms of the air and the water, but also the area under the terms of the air and the scale. . . We shall not have this series in the case of the scale, since the area under the terms of the scales is infinite. The relation of magnitude, on the other hand, includes both the area under the air and the area under the terms of the scales. . . To enumerate these terms would be to enumerate an infinite series. One term is the line, another the volume. Another, the time, the parallel lines. Another, the volume, another line. The relationship of magnitude includes not only the area under the lines of the line of the book, but also the area under the terms of the book. . . To enumerate these terms would be to enumerate an infinite series. One term is the case, another the time of the future. Another, the case, another parallel lines. Another, the time, the parallel lines of the past. Another, the book, another symbolic moments.

Dialogarius, who had not seen him in a long time, came out of the basement. "I know you've been carrying on these kinds of clandestine conversations with the pistol in your pocket, O Montague," he said after a few minutes. "I too have been thinking and speaking of a device that would permit me to communicate secretly with the Flying Press. I have come to the conclusion that the present impasse is the inevitable consequence of permitting a single man the secret right to the secret." He pointed to the portrait of Montague hung in the gallery. "This one," he said, "was created by a genius who lived and died in the Imagination Room. He died in the very vestibule whose barred window bore his last performance. The genius who created this superb specimen of his marvelous genius, confined within a limited space, without light or ventilation, without windows or doors — confined within an inexorable space, without doors or windows — was a mere man of few words." "A man of few words?" "A mere man of letters. He was a philosopher, a Raphael, perhaps. He was a pessimist, a Zimmerwald. He understood that all plans begin by asking whether the possessor will be a butcher, an artist, a navigator, a bureaucrat, a sailor or a politician. He understood that such plans are unworthy of the precious talents of an artist. He understood that all undertakings are less noble than none. He understood that the most direct path to glory is that which requires the least of courage, the least of success. He understood that the true artist is that which allows the least of all experiences. He understood that the true traveler is that which seeks the most of all, the least of all of all. He understood that the true artist is to seek the Imagination Room, the most of all of all, and die there, in the center, surrounded by his friends, who in turn exist in a circle of honor, who in a circle of renown, who in a circle of splendor. He understood that the true artist is one who dies seeking this circle of splendor and then dies seeking this circle of splendor and then dies seeking this circle of splendor. He understood that the circle is great, the moment he was born. He understood that the moment he died, no one was left who had felt as he had felt.

Dialog; it was a large, open stage with about twenty or thirty persons in it. I was leading a conversation with a Spaniard who was also my cousin. The conversation had reached an advanced stage; I said to him: "You know it is very difficult for a man to become innocent. He must be in some way guilty; he must understand that what he is about to do is an attempt to commit murder. In other words, he must be stupid; he must believe that the murder is an accident and that the guilty man will at the end get up and do the deed again." The Spaniard listened with apparent agreement, as though I had said something similar about the innocence of those who eat grapes. When I finished, I noticed that the face of the companion who had been having the conversation with the Jew had a certain expression of vexation or anger. I think he had noticed that I did not believe him to be innocent. Suddenly it occurred to me that the same stupidity which justified the murder of innocents was also justified by it in killing a stupid person. I said to the companion: "You don't believe that the man you are murdering is innocent? Go ahead and kill him; I shall spare his family." I don't know how many takes I took, but I know that there was a certain satisfaction in my voice. The man started at the sound, as though overwhelmed by terror; but I darted back with surprising swiftness. My sudden appearance caused him considerable surprise. I was standing facing him, my back to him, my hands behind my back. I said: "This is Nicolás Puente, my native land. I have brought news of a terrible crime." I pointed to a ditch in the fields beyond the desolated village. I repeated: "A crime committed by stupid people." I had reached the Spaniard's front door. I repeated: "A crime committed by stupid people." I reached for the handle of the door. I heard the wretched, frightened sob of the stranger who would not die.

The following day I observed in a few places the effusion of red. I went up the steps to the second floor, and down the steps again.

Dialogical Dialogue, Vol. II, pp. 476-81.



The concept of the "final discourse" is perhaps the most ancient of all. It dates back to the first philosophic dialogues, when the topics of argument and resolution were once again set forth with characteristic brevity by Shaolin bhikus and Buddhist mystics. These days we might say that the "dialogueues" we have in mind are "dialogues" no longer, since everybody subscribes to the opinion that the "final discourse" is everywhere permitted. . . But the notion of the "final discourse" persisted in those days. Jacques Reboul (Nôème-le-Croix, 1834, Appendix, par. 134) wrote: "We have here the dialectic of two contradictory worlds, where reality and the dream of reality are identical: worlds where it is not unusual for two opposed terms to be associated in the mind and where it is customary to find in one of the held terms an identical or an almost identical term in another of the supported terms. . . The existence of this duality has been proposed by Descartes, who observed that the mind naturally imagines a single, absolute, all-powerful object; but in the crystal ball or the triangle the mind naturally imagines an infinite series of discontinuous objects. . ." Another scholastic, Auguste Comte (Benelux Province, 1837, Appendix, par. 138), analyzing the world according to the principles of idealism, denies the reality of objective reality and attributes to it a relative reality which it conceives as consisting of ideas. . . From these fallatory autres Dichots, variées idealismes, herits de la nature métallique; Aldous Huxley (New Forest, 1964), upon examining Aldous Huxley's Echo of Worlds (Faber and Faber, 1944), sees only inverted causality. He observes that the original work of Toland, Man and the World, and that of his forerunner, The Catechism of Rome , teach that the world is an infinite series of "ideal" or "perfected" states, in which the individual finds himself at the moment of his redemption. Aldous Huxley's work, on the other hand, speaks of a single "ideal" consummated by the Crucifixion and the great tribulation. The world

Dialog. Those who mock or despise me, do so on account of my pretensions to Germanic languages and my neglect of Greek.

The more I think on these points, the more I feel that they have escaped my notice. I suspect that no one has noticed them before; I suspect they have now, and will probably again, the more I think about them. Let me try to recall them.

First, the question of time. It is easy to imagine a universe without change. If there were no past, no future; if there were no present or potential world, no suspended or ideal one; if there were no present or absolute being, what right have we to term it time? It is useless to answer with a metaphysical question: what right have we to call it time, we might ask, since our very being is time? Or we might reply: what right have we to call it time, we might ask, since our very being is time? Or we might reply: what right have we to call it time, we might ask, since our very being is time? Let us consider these questions in order.

Time is a relative term. One thing will take place at a certain moment in another moment; two things will happen at the same moment; so on as recursive up to infinite time. The moment we divide the world into two, instantaneously, is not time; the moment we do the same with one half of the world, instantaneously, is. We may say that one half of the world is my memory, another my will; another, my memory, another my will. When we forget, our actions do not correspond exactly to the past and the future; we make a mistake, speak wrongly, forget, speak wrongly. This happens all the time; we only forget it happens this way. Let us consider it once more. When we speak, our speech does not correspond exactly to the past and the future; we make a mistake, speak wrongly, forget, and forget wrongly. This happens all the time; we only forget it happens this way. Let us consider it once more. When we think, our thought doesn't correspond exactly to the past and the future; we make a mistake, speak wrongly, forget, and forget wrongly. This happens all the time; we only forget it happens that way. Let us consider it once more.

====================
Dialog (which I still have in the ladies' library) quotes a passage from the Critique of Pure and Political Reason, which Critchley rightly objects to as lacking in originality.426 For Critchley, the Critique is a mere "syntactical application" of the principle of inversion.427

Other discourses of Descartes on the nature of matter are abundant; I shall not attempt a comprehensive list here. But I shall cite a few that immediately come to mind. In the Analogy of Tristram Hexxecontevin he appeals to the fact that the circle of the discusIVE is the same as that of the mulier, the three-headed seraph, and the mulier's usual adversary, the seraph, thrones, thrones, languages, serpents, anders, and so forth.427 In the Topics theologique he reasons that the body of the Tome is the same as that of the whole, the concept of a visual medium the same as that of a mathematical one, and so on to infinity.

A third and perhaps more recent example of Cartesian nimbleness in metaphysics is found in the article by L. P. Bernoulli concerning names. Bernoulli observes that the philosophers maintain that in the world there are no names; that in each of our minds there is a name with which we are familiar, a name easily recognizable to us; that this ordinary name appears at times in the air, at other times in the pages of this or that book, at other times in the pleasant thought of an equable, at other times in the subtle lines of a rose.428 Cartaphilias, it is maintained, does not appear at times in these irregularly carved lines; it appears in the space of a second or a single stroke of a pen.429 Bernoulli objects that there is no formal reason for thinking that stroke of a pen would produce these random, asymmetrical patterns; secondly, that, if there are no names, there can be no such patterns; thirdly, that if there are no regular lines, there can be no regular shapes.430 Finally, Bernoulli concludes that for Cartaphilias to be a name of some kind ― of a symbol or of a symbolist like David Hume ― would be a contradiction; in virtue of which, Cartaphilias is a name.

In the last two examples,
====================
Dialogalism, which understands the world as a cyclical, parables about the nightingales, the tower is the nightingale whose song announces the infant Jesus. The world is a story told by men, but not all of them pawns of a game they do not understand. In the end, they win or they lose, but not always equally.

The superstitions of Northern Europe make it difficult to travel overland to the borders of the Lebensraum. I have heard that in Habsburg Russia the theory of reincarnation implies that the dead are always the clowns and the living the authors of the absurd events. In any case, the shortest way from my native state to the front lines of the Habsburg War is, like everybody else, prohibitively long.

In a book which is as incoherent as it is beautiful, the Russian cartographer I hear he emigrated from. The history of literature does not repeat itself, writes and rewrites itself, and now and then a mirror of true history makes its appearance. I listen with pleasure to the monologues of Schelling and to Vilsach about the parable of the inquisitive stallion and other equivocal aphorisms.1 But behind the plentiful images of equivocal aphorisms lurk the deep-seated monsters of idealism and historical materialism. Against these monsters, by way of analogy, I have brought you the case of a certain Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

Before delving into that case, it is necessary to recall that author and subject. I do not want to mention him, because he is no longer with us, and also because he is no longer alive. It is necessary to remember him, however, so that the foregoing case may not be repeated many times. He was born in 1919; he was injured in a game of chess, and from 1921 to 1929 he lived a double life. He was a knight of the Round Table, and also gambolered, or gamboled about, and wrote philosophical novels. (His most moving work is called The Outcast of Cádiz because it is a part of a real society, not a figment of the fictions of the chess tables.) Neither of these things is unknown to us, now that chess and novels have disappeared.

====================
Dialog

The first thing to note is the fact that the third person singular pronoun is not used. The reason is that the singular forms of the name Judas are nothing more than an inordinate form of arrogance. Who dares to speak of a God who is invisible and incomprehensible? Moreover, the arrogantly modest may as well imagine that the God who judges sinners and is angry is an impostor. In the third person singular singular is short for accusative, so that the God who judges sinners and is angry is an impostor, but that God who judges mankind and is kindly kind is not. And since the God who judges mankind and is kindly kind is not, the God who judges mankind and is unjust will also not judge unjustly.

The second thing to note is that the manuscript in which this paragraph is found is extant only in the Latin. The fact that it is so obscure that even the most cursory inspection cannot penetrate, but rather that a man intent on finding it (who should not be searching) should at least attempt it, is perhaps sufficient reason for excluding the possibility it has been corrupted or lost.

The third thing to note is that the date and place of the event parallel those of the "pagan" books of the Caesars' bulls. This fact, together with a certain familiarity with the "Pagan" regions of legend, must have inspired the suspect stranger with the idea of a busier occasion than that. The streets, the squares, the forts, the vast temple to Vesta, the sheep and cattle -- all these might be compared to those characteristic places of the "Pagan" world. The possibility that the events might be mere peripatetic experiences, that they have an apocalyptic significance, was, perhaps, too convenient a confirmation for the vague conviction that the "facts" they refer to are not "facts" at all.

The stranger's illness, his suspension in suspended animation, were, no doubt, an elaborate of visualization. They seemed timed to coincide with the appearance of the ubiquitous coin, the moment at which the panic subsided, the immense sum which the stranger had borrowed at interest, the moment of lighting of the last cigarette in a series of cigarettes, the inhalation of the intolerable stench which, the stranger later confessed, "had a familiar odor." The appearance of the large sum, the inhalation of that stench, the lighting of the cigarette, seemed to

The House of the Immortals



I had hoped to write a preface to Europa Est Charon, but that book has already done that for me. Europa Est Charon is a short story, but it contains vast systems of symbolism, vast metaphors; in its second volume, published some years ago, I tried to defend Europa against the assault of Liddell Hart and the vain assaults of Huckleberry Finn. I did not try to explain them; I attributed to them the power to animate my thinking. I wrote that the two men were as different from one another as the grass and the water are from one another. I think I have written it well. . . I cannot say with assurance that I did not write that to explain the grass to a fricasseur is the same as explaining it to a grasshopper. I cannot say with certainty that I did not write that the universe is a kind of museum, that the very act of existing is a kind of pilgrimage. I do not know if I wrote those words. . . I do know that I tried to defend them against the infinite onslaught of my friends.

My friends used to say to me: "You do not understand. You do not understand that the objects in your mind's scope are the same as the stones and the waters in other people's scopes. You don't understand that a painting may be the composition of one mind, a story of many, a poem of many tongues. . . You don't understand that the color red is the color of death, that the sound of two syllables is the same as the sound of several, that the idea of eating flesh with meat separated by bread makes perfect sense to one who has not been inside any human body. . . You don't understand that the composition of a work of art is like the coordination of atoms, like the apprehension of an idea whose parts never stop evolving and which lives on in the minds of those who receive it."

Dialog:

In our cities we see the same spectacle again and again; we imagine that the same man has created it, that all history has been the artistic generation of a single man. Let us imagine a society of men whose work is not repeated, whose memory is complete, whose principles are immortal. Let us imagine a society whose laws are not those of Egypt; let us not imagine a barbarous Egypt, where writing is forbidden and thieves and sorcerers reign. Let us imagine a society of men whose deeds are of a royal hue, of a hue of which our memory has not yet recovered its beginning. Let us imagine a Reinherstrube, a David, who has rediscovered the true form of the world.

The images which I have enumerated are not alike. Some of them, for example those of a depraved Simonides, have in them images which are not identical with images of the same dignity which are similar; images which have nothing in common with those which we as-

a passing emotionic thought — it is not difficult for me to recall in a fit of pangs of passion — images of consternation or of terror. . . Perhaps it is enough for me to recall one thing: perhaps there is a meaning to these images, perhaps they are a reflection of the man who worked them or of the man he has reflected himself to be. Perhaps I am, after all, in some way Rennaisance, and I am simply another man who has been and still is creating.

Then there are the timeless images, the inextricable and almost ineffable images, the images of the night sky, which seem to me not merely simple but essential. . . Perhaps I shall be able to perceive an infinity of identical constellations, as accomplished by the stars themselves. . . Perhaps there is nothing I can do, nothing expressible with my mind, nothing objective which is not also essentially human.

Then there are the dreams, the inextricable union of the dream and the waking world. Perhaps I shall be able to perceive a union of these dreams with the waking world, perhaps a union which transcends time and causality.

I do not know if I have said enough for a man to consider. I leave it as is. Let him add to it whatever considerations he may (for I am no longer bound by reason) and allow me leave.

Dialogis Sanctus, published in 1517, is probably the most famous of St. Thomas' writings, but there is a wealth of secondary literature on all aspects of the history of theology. The writings of Thomas are not to be despised; they possess certain vital qualities, important and original in their day, archaic in another. They are, however, modern in their logic and in their conceit. Theologians of the medieval tradition could not help but copy and modify this age-old stream of thought. Theologians of the modern tradition, on the other hand, strive to penetrate the thick and murky seas of time. Their works sometimes reach the past; their works sometimes reach the future. The theological achievements of the medieval and of the modern centuries are equally their pedigrees.



I. THEOLOGY AND THE EARTH



In all the dispensations of antiquity, theology has sought a home in history. In the Garden of Forking Paths, the poet Criteores tells us, the contest was open and won for men a stone pavilion at the foot of a hill; in Egypt, in the cult of Set, the renown of the pharaoh's chariot races upon the mists of memory. In the pages of the Koran, the orthodox scholar A. M. Ali notes, "the earth admitted the faith; the religion (Islam) embraced the earth."354 The Nestorian Pierre Menard affirmed that, before the advent of Mohammed, all religions had been transmitted through the ages;375 and, in a word, that all nations have been transported on the magnetic soil of a single faith.

The Christian faith, like all the other bounteous worlds of the cosmos, has been able to accept and perpetuate all intellectual and physical forms. It is not incompatible with irrelevance to deny its marvelous capacity ― and this I do not shrink from doing ― to be the home of all the worlds of the visible and invisible universe, and of the earth in particular. I appeal to the nameless provinces of north and south America. Hold forth your vernal fluids in gold leaf or porcelain; let us observe and enrich the soil of the earth.

In the countries of Ecuador, there is a plant which has been used for this purpose for many centuries. It is a narcotized cardamom; whenever the nose is rubbed on the cardamom, a kind of vibration takes place; this vibration, as is

Dialog, the text of the last volume of Leuheim's Faust. For Leuheim, nothing is too trivial. Nothing is imbecile, or trivial. Nothing interferes with the perfect circle of the Eternal. To have invented the telephone, he did not need to have invented the telephone. He invented it, from the material of ten years of labor, for a single hour of the day.

Let us imagine that the day has been a continuous day for him. Let us imagine also that on the fourth of June he has received a completed manuscript. Let us also imagine that the telephone has been an accessory to his work. Let us also imagine that the telephone has been a signal of confusion and distance. Let us also imagine that the telephone has been the result of some kind of fraud. Then we have the third form of the problem: the telephonic manuscript.

It is natural to ask: If the telephone has been a signal of confusion, of distance, what has been a preliminary work for me? To answer this we should return to the problem of the telephone. It is natural to speak of the work of a single person; however, even if we knew his name, we would still be led to think that he was a specialized mediator between heaven and earth. We have the manuscript; we know the name of the person who wrote it; but how is he related to the person who wrote it? The first edition of Leusiang lists him among its contributors; this does not rule out the possibility that this person had no part in the original, that he adapted it in some way. The fact is that the person who wrote it never claimed credit for it. In 1930 he had pulled it together; in 1939 he had put it away in the back of the drawer of his desk. The person who now receives it says to himself: Perhaps I shall receive one of my copies in the near future. In the meantime, I have prepared a new edition which will be ready in a few pages. I know that this person will find this note interesting, but I want to prefigure by a few pages the fact that I myself do not owe any importance to this work, and that its absence would be a small miracle.

I know that it is apropos of no purpose whatsoever to go on listing the ways in which Leuheim manipulates our hopes and fears. Let it suffice for me to mention one variation. He speaks

What is the starry night? It is a fancy I once cherished; now I know. It is this: The night and day are one solid circle, divided every thirty years into that few blocks of time when the earth and the top of the cylinder overlap. At that time, the cylinder is round, the floors are level, the ceiling is the same color as the floor. That is, the interior is the same as the exterior. At that time, the cylinder is larger than the outside; the exterior has the effect of making the inside longer than the outside larger than the interior. That is, the interior has the effect of making the interior longer than the exterior. At that time, the interior of the cylinder is larger than the exterior; the exterior has the effect of making the interior longer than the interior. At that time, the interior of the cylinder is greater than the exterior; the exterior has the effect of making the exterior longer than the interior. At that time, the interior of the cylinder is greater than the exterior and the interior of the cylinder is greater than the interior. At that time, the interior of the cylinder is greater than the interior and the interior of the cylinder. At that time, the interior of the cylinder is greater than the interior and the interior of the cylinder is greater than the interior.

Time and Chance



Time, when I wrote it, did not exist. It did not even exist as the spatial residue of the action of the past and the spatial residue of the action of the future. It existed only as the present tense of the verb "exist." The moment I said "time does not exist" my mind became transfixed by an inconceivable phenomenon. I thought I saw a red-hot disc, a disc of a certain size, with a certain trajectory. I thought I thought I saw a disc of a certain color. I thought I perceived a disc of a certain thickness. I was

Dialogipaeans and others, but also for those who studied the Theban and Egyptian languages, and for those who studied the Hermetic and Neo-Platonic mysteries. The latter were studied by those who studied astrology, by those who studied the Geist und Ihre Zurendräte, by those who studied that mystical philosophy which says that the world was made and constantly revives the same event in some other dimension, by those who studied the science of hypnasia, which teaches that the soul, before it leaves this body, passes through three or four incarnations in three or four alternate realities. . .

The Hermetic books contain many subtle doctrines which are not set forth in great detail in the apocryphal Gesta, but which nevertheless have given rise to universal superstition. One of these is that of the four cardinal directions, which the Gesta de scripci refers to as "the library of the blind." The Hermetic authors maintain (without determining) that the soul, before it leaves this world, passes through three or four incarnations in three or four alternate realities. This doctrine, if correct, must be of great assistance to physicians, astronomers, geologists, physicists, theologians and diviners, who are confronted with the problem of explaining in what manner the soul transmigrates from one body to another and from another reality to another. For centuries now it has been axiomatic: the soul, after it leaves this world, passes through three or four incarnations in three or four alternate realities. Nowhere does the Gesta refer to the "three or four" aspect of this transfiguration; it speaks of it as if it were twenty times truer than it is today. In the first century of Christianity (at the end of the third century A.D.) the theologians explained that the soul, before it leaves this world, passes through three or four incarnations in three or four alternate realities. In the thirteenth century (at the end of the thirteenth century A.D.) they explained that the soul, after it leaves this world, passes through three or four parallel universes. The seventeenth century (at the end of the seventeenth century A.D.) they explained that the soul, before it leaves this world, passes through three or four parallel worlds.

Q.E.D.



The following semantic correspondence has been proposed by Guillaume Giscard (Critique of Pure Science, IV, 418; also Fichte, Discipline, V, 525):



- "light" + "matter"



where "matter" is any combination of quarks and gluinos.



Kant (Metaphysics, 360, 371; also, General Theory, VII, 53, 58) distinguishes two kinds of objects: pure ideas and "pure" ideas that can be influenced by external conditions. Ideas that can be influenced by mere chance, as the psalm in Hymn 1:



Where the night is still,

the dawn seems to fade;

though these do not last,

they seem to fade

because they are ideas.



These ideas, according to fide'sposition, fall under the head of syllogistic syllogistic, which is analogous to the use of diachronic spaces in the Iliad.



If we interpret these syllogisms according to fide'sposition, we shall arrive at the following conclusion:



- all propositions that fall under the head of syllogism are syllogisms of ideas,

- all propositions that fall under the head of idea are ideas of a corporal kind.



This identification is straightforward enough; but people [donot want to think] in terms of the different parts,

but in terms of the essential unity, use the following dialectical devices: (1) in order to include all ideas, all propositions,

(2) in order to include all ideas, all syllogisms of a corporal kind,

(3) in order to include all ideas, all syllogisms of a pure idea.



The device used by Burke is the "whole number system": it is that, although the propositions and the ideas and the syllogisms of the system are actual, their realization is imaginary.

Dialogus aliquid, ut dicitur Dei sit, qui ejusdemur, sed philosophus, sed philosophus, sed esse.

The first part concerns the future, the second the present. Those who glance at the preceding pages will perceive that in the first the present is equated with eternity; in the second with space. The former is the subject of much philosophical speculation; the latter, though not all the time, less so. It is reasonable to infer that the former is quite foreign to the Christian religion; that, in an age when the universe and time are the objects of philosophical investigation, the divine presence which inspired the Psalm and the Angel of the Baroque Eugene Dürer should have struck fear into the hearts of man.

Nor is this necessary. The world, though it possesses substance, is not substance; it is a convenient abstraction; a convenient abstraction, then, is not substance, though it has substance. Time is not space; it is a convenient abstraction; a convenient abstraction, then, is not reality. To say that the world is a convenient abstraction is just as well said of the baroque as of the empiricist; it is a baroque of the empirical, and empirical of the baroque. The world is a convenient abstraction, since space is a convenient abstraction; to say that the world is not a convenient abstraction, since time is a convenient abstraction, is just as well said of the Baroque as of the Cartesian. To say that the world is not a convenient abstraction, since time is not a convenient abstraction, is just as well said of the Cartesian than of the idealist than of the idealist. To say that the world is not a convenient abstraction, but rather a necessary abstraction, is just as well said of the idealist than of the idealist than of the idealist. To say that the world is not a convenient abstraction, but rather a necessary abstraction, is just as well said of the idealist than of the idealist than of the idealist.

I have said that time and space are convenient abstractions; I have added that they are convenient abstractions which man can make use of; I have added that man can make use of them, just as he uses the baroque, in order to deceive himself. Man has invented a convenient abstraction, which he can use in order to deceive himself. He can say that the

Vive la France!

I used to go to Notre-dame with my mother, to the Chansonnière. We were very poor; one of the rooms had two little drawing-rooms, one double one, a cabinet for two chests, a half-moon for trick or treating, and on the last we had a closet for a double bed. One afternoon, Athos came in from the waiting room. He had a towel over his eyes, which were red from the rain. He sat down on the edge of the double bed, put out his eyes, and seemed not to recognize his appearance. He seemed to be suffering from headache; at that moment, Athos understood that the matter concerned him a great deal. He said to me: "Did you not said goodbye to Athos Varzi in the drawing-rooms?" "Yes, sir," I replied. "He died in the park?" "No, he did not die in the park." "Then he is not a crazy person anymore?" "No." "Then he is happy." "Happy!" I repeated to myself. "But if you want to die, you better die now." "I will not delay," I said angrily. "I will not die until my order is obeyed." "Very well." — I took off my shoes. "Here is Athos Varzi." "Here is the devil." "Look!" — I stabbed a single diamond into the rough stone — "with one of his own sapphires." "One fine jot more and this letter is done." "One jot less and this jot is enough." "One jot more and this jot is nothing." Athos Varzi was gone.

====================
Dialog, these ancient characters are to be found in the temples of Egypt or in those of the Orient; the latter characters are, as far as I know, those of the universal alphabet. . . The second status of that alphabet, universally recognized, is that of the medium. In China, in India, in the Semitic world, in England, in France, in Germany, everybody carries it in his pocket. The object of this article is not to appraise it, not even to determine whether it is valid or a sham. My object is to demonstrate that, in spite of the fact that the character sets itself a definite standard, that standard changes according to the medium and, eventually, to the medium's times and places.

The first standard is that used by all men in reading and writing: it is an absolute code, mechanical. This code, I repeat, is false. It is an arbitrary mechanical shorthand for the infinite combination of light, of matter, of energy. In the rooms and in the labyrinths of our imagination, there are infinite combinations of which this one is a classic; but this code is an approximation. The hands which write it get tired of playing and get impatient; men who do not worship the character set by chance get tired of playing the code: they get tired of reading it and they get tired of instructing it how to do its work. Shakespeare wrote it in a century and a half; by that time it would have become unconscious to him how different his work was doing to our time. The work of an actor is different from that of an observer. An observer will react in different ways to the manner in which a dramatic performance is made him; a practical actor will get tired of responding in the same terms in all situations. Different actors will have to master certain techniques in order to get the job done; an observer will have to master certain techniques in order to get the job done.

The work of an actor is different in two respects: (a) in the number of times he or she plays the part; and (b) in the variety with which he or she plays it. To determine the number of times an actor plays the part is a vain exercise: the more varied the part, the more variations there are for an actor to master. To determine the variety with which an actor plays it is foolish to prize variety: only variety can justify the desire for variety in the performance of an art. A virtu
====================
Dialog.

Moyn Prose has provided a wealth of examples of corruptible writing, both literary and practical. One of the most striking is that of Seneca, which has been interpreted by Moore as the work of a single author. This is not entirely faithful, for there are six Sartor Resartus and two Naturalis historians who could plausibly have read him. Another is that work by Shakespeare entitled Measure for Measure, which has been interpreted by Moore as the work of twelve persons, most notably the octogenarian George Butler-Smith. Another is the epic poem The Rape of Lucua, by Robert Browning, which has been interpreted by Moore as the work of more than twelve authors.

Another example is that of the aerial trampled chariot scene from Wagner's Feind and the Guardian. This is one of those cases in art where it is useless to inquire into the originality of the effect; we know that originality is a quality ineffable and only the most superficial observation of literature can veil it. The scene appears in the NSDAP handbook, in the manual of Levi Eshbaugh, in the manuals of the Zetas and the Knights of the Round Table. The author of these stories is unknown, but it is certain that he repudiates all connection with the actual incidents.

Another example is that of the endless mountain road scene from Schopenhauer's Fables. These scenes chronicle the subterranean progress of nations and subvert our preconceptions about the aborigines of the earth. It is certain that these scenes are apocryphal, for Schopenhauer and Flanders. But they serve as examples, a technique borrowed from psychology. The idea is to blur the line between present day reality and the prehistoric past, so that in the abstract world of today's readers it is sufficient to turn to Flanders or the fables of Flanders to understand those days.

Another example is that of the pantomime king and his retinue of goatherds. These scenes are apocryphal, for the seventies of our century turned to the kingdoms of fantasy.

Another example is that of the invisible maid and the dagger. These scenes are apocryphal, for the eighties of our century turned to the stories of Juan Ferreyr. But these stories, too, serve as an inspiration, a symbolic language, a symbolic language.

Dialogical about it. My memory is haphazard. Perhaps I remember it as follows: that there was a famous play, The Tempest, which was performed in Milan in 1492; that after the performance of the play, the people went out to drink of the harbor; that after a certain amount of time had elapsed, the mistress of the house came in a lantern and set fire to the house.

This horrible incident had taken place about two years before. I do not know whether I was in Rome on a diplomatic mission or on an official one. I do not know whether I was at the instigation of Helio or of the ambassador from Milan. I do not know whether I was summoned by the play's author or by the editor. I do not know whether I contributed to the catastrophe, or merely interpreted it. I only recall that a man of about my age (perhaps my age, perhaps my lack of contribution) caused the worst outrage. I do not know whether he was intoxicated with power or with excitement. I do not know whether he was negligent or indifferent. . . I know that I was in a hostile city and that a man of my station could not have caused such havoc. However, I do not know whether the havoc was accidental or whether it was the work of someone with access to secret means. I do not know whether the havoc was intended or whether it was permitted by some other power. I do not know whether the havoc was public or secret. I know that it was broadcast over the entire city.

The following are the incidents in the order indicated. The one hundred and twelfth anniversary of the death of Rodrigo de Seguron is missing. Nor is there any evidence that the catastrophe took place more than a century ago.

On the night of February fifth (the year before), an extraordinary thing happened. A certain Juan de la Cruz de Brito, second in command of the Guardia Fissile, passed through Calle Quinqué on his way to Tlaxcala. The Quinqué weather forecast called for rain that day; Brito, who was passing through Tlaxcala on business, decided to take the chance and rode through the storm. The rain stopped completely without a sound that afternoon; that day, Brito did not know whether he would die or survive as a footnote in the history of the frontier wars.

After lunch, Brito, drinking with his companion (
====================
Dialog or the Parallel? The first is more manageable, the second more interesting.

The parallelism is not absolute. Suppose there is a man who is a perfect mirror of his past self, a mirror of sin, of vice, of ignorance, but also of a past passion. The present self is obliterated, but the imperfect memory of that past self persists. The memory of the past self exists to recall these past virtues and its future self is a reflection of these past virtues and also of these virtues and so on to infinity. The question arises: How infinite is the universe?

Schopenhauer (Rhetorik und Vorangel und Vorstellung) distinguishes between ideal and practical space. The former is the absolute sphere whose center is everywhere and whose radius is nothing; the latter, the circumferential sphere whose center is only at the poles and whose radius is along the length of the poles. Space is not imperceptible, since its center is everywhere and because the circumference of a circumferential sphere is also its center; in the space of a practical man, the space of the clock, the space of the bathroom, the space of a bicycle lock, the circumference of a circumferential sphere is no less than the circumference of a human being. In the universe of Schopenhauer, the distinction between the two spheres would be superfluous. In the sphere of everyday life, the distinction would not be necessary. The circumference of the circumferential sphere would have the value 1, the value of a tooth; in the universe of philosophy, the distinction would be necessary.

The Schopenhárlichen Untersuchungen

"Idea, then, is the medium through which the infinite series of objects (which are the intelligibles Ideas) is perceived. But in what way is not known. The perceiver can choose either to abstract from the series the specific qualities of objects or to abstract from it the series of relationships existing between the individual objects. The former would make sense to him who abstracted it, but the latter to him who received it. The former type of reception is not suitable for man; the latter type of reception is not suitable for a library of intelligibles. Philosophy has not found a suitable type of reception for the series of relationships existing between the individual objects. The Schopenhár ― the letter ― is one of the letters of the alphabet, but its practical reception

Dialog: God is in the air, water is drunk.

The idea, strange as it may sound, is that if God is not in the air, water is not drunk, then the world is unreal. This idea, if it is even a suggestion, is found in the Omne al-Ishaq and other like ideas.

Another, more familiar, and perhaps more profound, idea is that of God's omnipotence. Theists constantly speak of being in a relationship with God, of being "in his favor." If God is in a relationship with us, we are in a relationship with him. If God is in a relationship with eternity, we are in a relationship with time. If God is in a relationship with the stars, we are in a relationship with the night. If God is in a relationship with the sand, we are in a relationship with the seven deadly sins. If God is in a relationship with the roman numerals, we are in a relationship with the inexorable process of the profane numerals. If God is in a relationship with the pebbles on the road, we are in a relationship with the desolation of iniquity. If God is in a relationship with the footprints in the snow, we are in a relationship with the anguished prayer of every pilgrim.

Let us turn now to the more ancient ideas, those which had a special value in the infinitives of the times of Christ. These ideas are found in the Apocalypse of Macrina and in the Orphic times.

Apocalypse of Macrina

The fool sees the dragon, but knows not the true nature of the beast.

The ancients spoke of a dragon, of a dragon who devours, of a dragon who is light, of a dragon who is fire, of a dragon who is water, of a dragon who is love, of a dragon who is the archangels, of a dragon who is the nations, of a dragon who is the kingdoms. The fool sees the emperor, but knows not the person of the conqueror.

The ancients spoke of an emperor, of an emperor who is mild, of an emperor who is wise, of an emperor who is of the earth, of an emperor who is of the future. The fool sees the empire, but knows not the reason of its great attachment.

Dialog (syntactic ambiguity, apodictic proximity) is the failure of a language to provide a single language. The difficulties of specifying a single subject in a language are well known. Fortunately, the experience of many languages, the knowledge of many vocabularies, can eliminate many difficulties. The fact that certain dialects of Portuguese use the very same negative (inconsistent) prefix indicates that this usage is universal.

The problem of the indefinite article has been analyzed and its solution suggested by Léon Bloy. According to him, in a given language the objective case is inflected: the objective case of "who?" is inflected to "how?" and the subjective case of "when?" to "where?" and so on to infinity. In such a language, the object of "who?" would be "who do you think you are, Captain Bloy?" The objective case of "where?" would be "where are you from, San Juan de Zunegunca?" The subject of "when do you think you are, San Juan de Zunegunca?" would be "when how soon, San Juan de Zunegunca?" (Bloy, 1893, 199–200). The ultimate dual case of "to what end do you aim, San Juan de Zunegunca?" would be "to what end do you aim, San Juan de Zunegunca, to what end?" (Bloy, 1893, 201). In such a tripartite language, "who?" and "how?" are objective and subjective, and the latter are intransitive. The solution proposed by Bloy is to change the intransitive to an interjective tone of the voice. The voice of the captain asks of San Juan de Zunegunca two questions: (1) how soon do you intend to change places with San Juan de Zunegunca, San Juan de Zuneguncas and to change places with San Juan de Zunegunca? (2) how soon do you aim to change places with San Juan de Zunegunca, San Juan de Zuneguncas and to be San Juan de Zuneguncas?" This solution eliminates the need for "do you think you are, San Juan de Zunegunca?" and "how soon do you intend to change places with San Juan de Zunegunca

Dialogical problem." According to these qualities, the phenomena of Zoroastrianism can also be called astrological, and it is fitting to point out that this astrological character is not absolute. "The sun," writes St. Paul, "rises in the East and sets in the West, the ruler of the two is the slave, the enslaved are the righteous." We can also observe that the Zoroastrians attribute to the divine power the destiny of enslaving their own people and instructing them in idolatry. The Zoroastrians, in this same chapter of the Bible, attribute to the divine power the destiny of enslaving their own people and instructing them in idolatry. 116

I have said that the Zoroastrians have a similar destiny. According to their cosmogonies, in a few generations the descendants of the heroes of old will be as ignorant of the cosmos as are the Jaredites who built the last house. The Zoroastrians, in order to free themselves from this condition, declare that they are divine. They declare that they are the authors of their destiny. They declare that they rule over a great and invisible cosmos and that they are the interpreters of will and that they are the first to attain to the firm belief in a personal God.

The World According to Horus

The following extract is taken from the first part of the work Ixxxv. to designate the World to Come and the World to Come According to Horus, written in the third century of the Hegira. It is a thesis of Isis, extracted from the Histories of Ruh, another of Isis; it concerns the distinction to be drawn between the world of the dead and the world of the living. Both classes of beings are dear to her; she knows that they exist and cherishes in them life which is equal to that of the deceased. The World According to Horus

The Sign

To sign a contract is to enter into an obligation, a contract. The execution of the contract is the precondition for the enjoyment of the good we have signed; the execution of a contract is a precondition for its performance. A contract which is not performed is void, and the efficient law judges that an imperfect performance is an imperfect obligation. I, who have signed this contract, execute it, but the good which I have promised is void because I am not willing to perform it. The law has set the performance of an imperfect obligation against us, not against the performance of an infinite good. A contract which is not performed is a contract of minutiae, not of substance. A performance is a proof of an infinite good; an imperfect performance is a proof of a deficiency in the good itself. The theory of contracts teaches that an imperfect performance is an imperfect performance, a proof of a void thing; an imperfect performance is a proof of a condition outside the thing itself.

The contract we have enumerated is a good, and the good we have in our power is the performance of its terms. To refuse to perform its terms is an impossible act; to perform them is to reject the good we have signed, and the good we have signed. The performance of an impossible act is a precondition for the performance of a good; the performance of a good is a precondition for the performance of an infinite good. The latter we may speak of as a thing of nothingness. It is an infinite circle, a sphere with an irregular top and a radius divided into rays. The top and the radius are not parts of the sphere; they are external features of the good which separate it from the things around it. To say that they separate it from it is to say that they are not part of it, a part which we can take away, a part which can be put to other uses. Let us say that they form the face of the good. Now the good has none of these external features, since it is non-existent. The only things that can be part of the good are its expressions, such as knowledge and love; these expressions are not external to it, since they are in the things they designate. The external expressions of the good are internal; they are its soul, which is essentially non-existent; they are contained in the insatiable intelligence, which is essentially non-existent; they

Dialoges of Germain; for example, one of his pamphlets against the "posh" theory of history. The critique of the Bauplan solution is full of lucid and original ideas.

In 1923, with the help of the Charakters, he published his "Critique of Political Economy"; it is a lucid exposition of the basic propositions of the present essay, though without the Bauplanian incisiveness which characterized the first. It is also instructive in certain ways, albeit perhaps a little repetitious, a little like a Swiss biologist's exposition of the molecular principles of life, thoughting up against the inexorable law of diminishing numbers.

In 1929, he was made professor of economics at the University of Mainz. This meant the isolation of his creative apparatus. He began to think of ways in which to deal with the immense social problem of socialization of the means of production. The first suggestion was to have a vast network of cooperatives create socially useful products, sell them to the workers through the cooperatives and distribute the profits to the community as social benefits. These products would be "real" necessities of life, like bread, meat and clothes.

This proposal caught on with the support of a great many specialists in this field. Among them were Germain Aulas, one of the fathers of modern cooperative planning, and, later, the great socialist economist Adam Smith. Smith had criticized the "incomparability of a share in a well-managed industry, or in that part of a well-managed industry paid for by the worker, althoir ostensible importance;" he had also urged that the government should establish a policy of encouraging the sharing out of the producers, and he had written that the profit motive should be banished from economic policy "until it can be so dispensed with that a just rule of thumb may safely be applied, that the social value of an article should be proportional to its social service."

Germain Aulas is undoubtedly Smith. He understood that to advocate a policy of encouraging the sharing out of producers is a "rightist" one. He understood that to advocate a policy of abating the profits of the owners of the productive assets is a "aristocraty." He understood that to advocate a policy of greatly expanding the social benefits of labor is "a science." He understood that to analyze these phenomena, which belong to the higher category of neoclassical explanation, and to

Dialog.

The great and the small letters of that code are found in the "Translation and Redaction," II, 10, which has been quoted. The translation is by C. E. Joly:

"The work translated by Joly is a literal and categorical refutation of Kant's categorical theorems. This work not only apologizes for the theorems it renders, it also makes explicit the theorems it disproves. Insofar as the antitheses it disproves are applicable to reason, it is of the opinion that reason alone is free from them. Reason is not guilty of inconsistency; it is justified by the categorical theorems. It is its greatest achievement to be able to prove the necessity of necessity, of indubitable necessity, of an immanent cause which justifies us in regard to all possible principles. The proof runs thus: If some principle be true, as is clear from its having been verified once in the interval of time from I to II, and again in the interval from I to III, and so on to I to infinity, it is reasonable to infer that the other verifications are also true. (This inference is called a priori.) Every verification of the just cause is already precluded by contradiction; every nugget of good faith is already accounted good in terms of justification. Logic, by means of this subtle and almost invisible torture, absolves itself of its monstrous crime against reason. It shows that the just cause is an inconceivable unity. It is irrational and it is void. The just cause is complex and eternal. It is all that is.

"The just cause is all being. It is the space and time that these times and spaces occupy. It is the just cause, then, which holds that all things have a just cause and that cause A is the just cause and all just causes are necessary. (This justification, I repeat, is a priori.)

"The just cause is all that is. It is the object of desire. It is the will of the just cause to endow the object with worth. (This justification, I repeat, is a priori.)

"The just cause is all that exists. It is the mind which in time and space has made the just cause present and powerful to the world. It is the just cause which at the present moment comprehends the just cause. (This justification, I repeat,

After dinner, the two young men returned to the lodgings of Leuven. Lönnrot, without the least inclination to regret having undergone such a detour, felt that he had accomplished more than he had anticipated. He had trusted to chance, he had hoped against hope that a stranger--a van driver who would take him to the League of Nations in Paris and back again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again--he would be able to complete the labyrinth in an instant. He had thought that a machine could do his work for him. Now he knew that a man alone can. He determined to do it. He reflected that it would be unseemly and improper to vanish suddenly into the night; that, if everything went according to plan, he would be seen walking alone in the Rue Saint-Denis. He resolved that the best scheme he could devise would be to step out of the Square at the Portal du Nord, return at dawn, enter the House of Lords, be recognized at the House of Lies, be recognized at Bordeaux, be swallowed up in the confusion of the Palais Royal, be discovered in a confused and leaking manner by a lamp shop keeper who believed himself to know the Duke of Malfi, and so on, endlessly. This plan he conceived, in the face of the possibility that such and such a revelation might be the end of it.

He wandered about the house day and night, in search of those who knew how to make rats and those who knew how to make rats knowtership. His constant companion was Frigo Zanardi, who at first was obliging enough, but who at length became aloof and rude. Lönnrot had the unfortunate fortune to have recourse to a process of roguery.

Dialog, which must have seemed ridiculous to him; no one in the whole world understands what he is saying, but he is able to communicate it with a certain logic and exactness. I can understand him.

The first discourse is called the "Dantean Pamphlet on the Categories of Aristotle." It is a book of 90 pages, red and blue and yellow capital letters. The second is called the "Book of the Obscurus." It is about 100 pages long. The volumes are filled with very ancient and conflicting writings. In the third volume is written this strange doctrine: that the total universe consists of one eternal substance, the light of which is the same for all and no one, neither night nor day, can dissolve it, since the substance of the light is the same for all and no one. The authors tell us that this substance (which they term the "spirit of the world") is identical with the light of the world and is the result of an as yet undetermined process beginning with the sphere and proceeding toward the stars and the firmament. They go on to explain that the process of ascent to heaven is identical with the propagation of this substance, and that the two are, in fact, the same. This process of ascent to heaven, the authors say, is continuous, and its object, the place or place where all are equal and where all things will have one thing in common, the sun. The subject of all things, the object of one, the one of all. This doctrine, the Philosophic Imperative, perplexes the most stolid minds. It is stated many times, but nowhere clearly defined; it is illustrated many times, but nowhere symbolized; it is related many times, but nowhere directly connected; its mysterious author leaves many questions unanswered. The foregoing paragraphs may be taken as a symbolical exposition of the second discourse.

The theory of the Obscurus consists of two parts: (a) On the Form of the World, which teaches that all things are of some continuous substance and that the terms "world," "petrogeny," "variations," and "transitions" (which I have indicated seven times) signify variations or transitions in this substance; and (b) On the Form of the Person of the Obscurus, which teaches that the world and the substance are the same Person (the "spirit of the world") and that all things are his immediate effects and that this same

The Problem of Time

The Tibetan maxim "tathata vedanta bhikkhu" ("time is a bird whose flight is knowledge") is derived from the following passages of the Therigatha: "There are times when one feels as one would a chill, and times when one feels as one would play of flute. . . There are also times when one feels no pain, and others when one feels infinite bliss." The Buddha compared the first type of tathata to a blind man who feels painless while looking at a rainbow, and the second type to one who feels nothing at all. He said that a

Paul V for Schrodinger (I, 61): The universe, as I have just said, is a consequence of the first law. The second law, which regulates all other laws, is a veil which an ignorant person may step into: it is more difficult for him to fulfill his part than it is for us to fulfill ours.

Thesis rejected: III (1963): For the second half of the Metaphysics I have here a thesis which is not explicitly stated: the distinction is here arbitrary; it could be that this part of the work is nothing else than a refutation of the first half. Nevertheless, the fact that this thesis is implicit does not mean that it is falsifiable. Schrodinger could have set forth with it: that the universe is a logical necessity of the second law, i.e., of its component elements, is sufficient reason for rejecting it. The same could be said of the postulate of the divisibility of prayers.

On page 471 of the Encyclopaedia Brittonorum, which I have not the gumption to check, we read: "The Britannorum is an order of scholars of noble lineage, though its citizens include commoners. It was founded by the Hun King Arthur on the Isle of Man in the year 970, and within a century included many of the noble houses of the island. The successors of the foundation, the Pilgrims, follow a different policy. . . The management of a large and mysterious order entails great responsibility; it is with this responsibility that we, as members of the Britannorum, enter here."

My first thought was that this announcement was a hoax. My second was that the author meant the nonexistent Institute of Benefit Metaphysics, whose sole purpose is to level with our dead god the size and weight of the universe and the prayers of man.

"If my argument from obviousness is valid, there must be a better one. Let us try the one with which we are currently engaged."

Alphonse Preline once observed that all men are confronted by two kinds of errors: those which they commit habitually and those which they commit negligently. He thought it reasonable that the former not only should not be impugned, but also that it should be given precedence. The present work, like all of Preline's writings, owes its formation to the inspiration of a single thought: an erroneous reading of a passage by Ernest Mandelbrot caused him the honor of completing it.

The Practice of War

By John Stuart Mill

What is meant by a true literature? Does not every man admit at some period of his life that Shakespeare, Shelley and Shakespeare, T. S. Eliot, Louis Althusser, Robert Browning, Charles Martel, George Moore and Robert Schumann, to cite but a few? Has not Henry James confessed that his classic work, War and Peace, was written during the last three years of the last century, during the most extraordinary times when the human family was threatened by total war? As to the rest of mankind, what use is history to us, if the historians do not reveal to us the secret purpose of events?

I have now ventured to formulate, in a word coherent, an adequate theory of the nature of military history. During my absence the world has not repeated the test of time, and it is certain that human ingenuity will not succeed in perfecting the task. On the other hand, there is no other science which purports to explain the universe, or which promises an unerring explanation of the universe, except superstition. Science has made a limited discovery: that the material world is best understood as a system of interwoven connections which determine the physical world. It is this structure which we call society; and if we wish to understand the actions of individuals, it is well to understand it in such a way that its connections with those of society are as subtle as possible.

The first step is to recall that our senses are direct; we can touch a stone

Dialogification of the Laws" (1801), in which he tried to harmonize the four branches of the Christian religion: Judaism, Islam, Buddhism. Of the first branch he wrote: "The third, which concerns the universe; of the fourth, the attainment of Buddhahood" ― that is, eternal life. He considered that to speak of eternal life ― that of the Universe ― ― is to speak of a dream. He felt that to speak of the attainment of Buddhahood ― that of union with God ― is to speak of imposture. The following year, in the third article of the same work, he wrote: "The three branches of Christianity ― Judaism, Islam, Buddhism ― are all the same thing: the superstition of a people or of a god who has placed himself in the midst of men. The problem is this: How can one say that a god has placed himself in the midst of men and yet judge him, in the exercise of this place, of the transgressions of countless nations, of centuries, of generations? . . The answer is straightforward: One must renounce all idealism and base one's disbelief on the sole fact that a god has placed himself in the midst of men."

In his essay "On the Names of the Princes" (1803) Bachetray endeavoured to arrive at a criterion of sovereign excellence. "Pierre Menard, name-writer, has invented a new science. Let us imagine that in some far country there is a king who is a name-writer. We should be able to judge from this fact-finder's description how good or bad he thinks the writing is likely to be ― how original, accessible and spontaneous ― within the limits prescribed by the king. If we consider that writing has rarely within these limits been original, how could we judge of the king's writing? If we consider that within each name-book there have been additions and subtractions, how could we judge of the king's writing? If we consider that within each book of the sacred books there have been typographical and collation errors, how could we judge of the errors?" Thus did he labor away, in the name of a justificatory end, at producing a work which was equal to that of its king. Jacques-Louis David, in his admirable work on the literature of Asia, touches a comparatively modest nerve: "Videodama is the book that I read in childhood."

Dialoges de la lune. Voltaire's "Paradiso" has been translated into Russian, and the "Eccleston" who translated the "Paradiso" has written a modern and useful edition of Arnold Bennett Laqueur.

I shall close by recalling a circumstance which occupied the attention of all these twenty years: the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on June 23, Archduke Franz Josef Ferdinand died in Poznan on July 20. This great event occupied all of us; we thought of it and we dreamed about it. It was a fact which no one tried to change, because it is so obvious. A man has two feet: he can say he has foot number one, or he can say he has foot number two. With the former one thing in the world seems to him one less, and he feels wounded and empty. But if he had to choose one of the two, which would he choose? He would say to himself, not my foot, my greater foot, for myself; or to himself, knowing that the choice is not so obvious, knowing that the matter is multifarious and ambiguous? There is a book on the index: on page twenty-three it says: "The Faerie Game." On page twenty-four: "On Fighting Evil Persons and On Using Symbols In Combat." On page twenty-five: "On The Importance Of Study And Conspiracy With Evil Ones And In General, INDEED, INVADER'S ARMORY." On page twenty- six: "About The Origin Of The Solar System And How It Interfered With The Big Bang, And Also, INTERFERVED, WITH THE FLIGHT." On page twenty-seven: "About Fighting The Tartar And Their Magic Frog Man, AND, AND AGAIN, WITH THE ARMOR)." On page twenty-eight: "About Magic And How To Get MR. MAGIC." On page twenty-nine: "About Monsters And How To STOP MALEVOLENT MACHINES, AND ALSO, MOST IMPORTANTLY, WITH MOST MISUNDERSTANDING." And so on, down to the twentieth page, when we found out that Franz Josef Ferdinand had been murdered in Maribor on the night of the 28th of June, i.e. in 1868.

I repeat: there is no proof whatsoever that

Dialoga del Jardinale, n° II, April and May 1919.

The first volume of the present work is a transcription of an interview with Adolf Hitler conducted by the German journalist and ardent Lebensraum sympathizer August Strindberg, who died in a hotel in Nuremberg on January the third, 1957. A number of the statements in this interview are contained in my other publications, for example, Lebensraum hat einem große, n° 2 (Hausa Verlag, 1928), den Gotteswahl der ehemaligen Sprache (Hohesrade, 1928), den ehemaligen Sprache (Hohesrade, 1929), den ehemaligen Sprache (Hohesrade, 1930)), and in the autobiographical book Wirklichkeit der ehemaligen Sprache (Wiedmannstraße, 1932).

The interview was taken on April the eighth and ten minutes into the talk Hitler gave at the ball at the end of October (Arenberg, 1921), followed a few days later by a talk at the Hotel de Toulon (Rue de Toulouse, Antoine, and Co., 1925), a talk at the Hotel de Ville (De Beers Mint, 1930), another at the Hotel du Nord (De Beers Mint, 1930), another at the Hotel du Marmorino (De Beers Mint, 1930), another at the Hotel des Langues (De Beers Mint, 1930), a third at the Carlton hotel on rue de Toulon (De Beers Mint, May afternoon, 1931), a fourth (not yet published) at the Carlton hotel on rue de Toulon (De Beers Mint, May afternoon, 1932), a fifth at the Carlton hotel on rue de Toulon (De Beers Mint, 1932), a sixth at the Carlton hotel on rue de Toulon (De Beers Mint, 1934), a seventh (not yet published) at the Carlton hotel on rue de Toulon (De Beers Mint, 1934), a eighth (not yet published) at the Carlton hotel on rue de Toulon (De Beers Mint, 1936), a ninth at the Carlton hotel on rue de Toulon (De Beers Mint, 1938), a tenth at the Carlton hotel on rue de Toulon (De Beers Mint,

Dialogory. The following are some of the statements made by him:

The first man was born of the water and the wind; the last man was born of the water and the earth. . .I saw Jesus of Nazianna: white as snow, gladiatorial, splendor and agony. . .I saw a child of fire, the image of a tiger and a horse: flames and sparks, blood and smoke. . .I saw a man of flesh and bones, an ensign of the gods. . .I saw the divinity: it was like a lion, fierce and majestic, or like a horse that had undergone a metamorphosis. (The Magic of Human Feelings, 1897, page 109.)

A short time later, in another volume of the Kabbalah, the Hermeticists write: "Man is the result of one thousand ten thousand years of evolution, of the interplay of the gods and men. He appears as a phoenix or as a lion on a Friday night in a country town, but beneath the surface he is a human being with memories, with a heart, with souls. . . The rainbow of the Hermetic philosophers is but the reflection of the multitudes which day and night scatter about upon the plain. Man is but the transition period."

Pagan philosophers have also attributed pre-Adamite precursors to man; the oldest tales speak of the first man who is not of this world, the man of Finns and Offenasons and Parnes and Quixotes and Todaysavers. . . Men are said to have been gods, Men were but men to him. (The Varieties of Feudal Japan, 1890, page 177.)

In Germany, theorems of this kind have baffled theologians from the Townes of Caen to the Restos of Vermillion. In 1847, James Ginter, interested in an analogous vein, postulated that "the pre-Adamitical state of innocence is the precursors of the state of sin." (Logik des Alten Alpes, I, 445.) A century later, Pierre Menard (vol. ii., p. 584) declared: "We are faced with an absolutely certain anthropology: biology and metaphysics declare that man is a fallible being; metaphysics, that he is an immobile, dynamic, immortal being. Man's destiny is to prove

For example, the first page of the Italian edition of the "De rerum natura" has three hundred translations. The first "translation" is from Diego Sanchez de Toribio (1797-1824), who composed the "Expugnant C" of Davila's de compilation scientifique (1796). The "translation" from the "Historia rationala" is an abbreviated version of the following entry in the work of the same name (translated by Francisco de la Torre, 1808): "There exists, and has existed for some time, an essential unity of subject and object, one and the same thing. This unity is the universe, which is an inextricable series of connected beings. The series has no beginning or end. It is not circular, nor is it elliptical, but it immediately and exhaustively reveals itself to be one single whole. There is no inconsistency in calling it the universe. It is true that some of its terms are not so self-evident: for example, the Symbol, which has been a faithful servant of Leibniz, is no longer so; the word ideal is no less applicable to our world than it was to that of Zeno; and the principal theme of our work, the origin and development of the conscience, is no less inadequate than that of the Equatorial Africa."

The following are selected specimens of the translations which have been made. The form of the translation is that suggested by the National Library of Spain.

"The art of speaking is but the study of the mind; one does not make a nest in a pine tree and fly to the west."

"There is no philosophy so general that it does not embrace others and has not been corrupted by others. Parmenides, for example, did not believe in the existence of a private personal God; Schopenhauer, Bachelier, Campbell, Livingston, Ale to mention a few. Each one of them could distinguish the logics and methods of his opposite number and excelled them in subtleties which it is useless to try to enumerate."

"Man is his own genus' and 'his powers are his own limits.'"

Dialog:

Some days, I have thought, I would like to be a priest. I have pondered whether this was not a matter of chance, as I believe many men are; I am sure that if I had become one, I should not have thought of stealing bread. Perhaps I would not have tried it, or done it, or forgotten.

What is the use of quoting Isaac Asimov, who says that the human being is the most beautiful object that science has discovered? Perhaps it is useful to recall a passage from Diderot: "The universe is reprobated; it is ridiculous to imagine that the heavens and the earth and the sea and the electric light which you feel are the work of an invisible and powerful architect are the work of any one person."

Let us now consider another question which has lately arisen in philosophy. Some one says that the first cause is nothing else than our will. Diderot replies that the first cause is not the prior will at all, but the will to an unreality which reason can't cure. Locke affirms that the world is all the mind can conceive it to be. Aristleith says that the world is the succession of ideas which a man has formed of the universe. The Stoics maintain that the world is the succession of consecutive existences, i.e. of an eternal unity which is neither present nor past nor future nor(timeless) nor indivisible.

The world, it has been remarked, is an acquired taste. Does this soghion mean anything to us, or is it merely a metaphorical fashion?

Hence it is fitting to inquire into this acquired taste.

Metaphysically, the word seems to me to refer to the archetype of the archetype, or to the principle of equality of all things. It is so in Aristotle, but he does not see that this principle is a necessary property of all things, as is demonstrated by (I, II).

According to the Stoics, the world is made up of two aspects, present and future. These present and future aspects are each called a passion and it is through these passions that we experience the world. Each passion has a corresponding idea in the mind of the subject, which in turn has an idea in the mind of the object. Each idea has a cause, which is demonstrated by Plato (Phaedrus, I, 2).

It is some thirty years since the last of the members of the Miskatonic family left for the West. The father died without seeing his daughter again; the mother had a stroke in the library; the sons, with unremitting energy, filled the post of combative instructor; the women's movement flourished; the Miss America contest was held annually in New York; the Miskatonic University accepted the syllabus of Marxism.

No one expects to see the Miskatonic University any longer: not the historians, not the archivists, not the library visitors (if they exist) who search for it, not the visitors to the antiques shop who mistake it for a large bookshop, not the clients who ask for copies of "The Communist Manifesto" or "Principles of Economics"; the university, the offspring of the witch hunts, has become the intellectual and literary home of the United States. It is even more natural that the university officials, in their infinite wisdom, should take this step. It was not impossible for them not to do so; it was, however, customary for them to do so. They have been trained to imagine that in America there is no private property, that no one can falter when he establishes title to anything; but there is no private ownership, nothing but a tacit or explicit permission, which permits someone else to use it. In England, where feudal tenure is rare, this permission is tacit and explicit. In America, where it is unlimited, it is as if someone had left a contract on a dais with an unlimited warranty: the warranty was that the job would be fulfilled precisely because it was implied that the job would be fulfilled. The university officials did not ask why this contract was "illusory"; they only asked what kind of contract it was.

The founders of the new country accepted the dialectical method, which demands the sum total of contradictory arguments, the compromise of tranquillity for the synthesis of the universe. They understood that philosophy is the acquisition of language in order to acquire nature; the former, brut, ille tristique, is valueless without the latter, brut, ille luce use afflicting the world, use of philosophy, in order to acquire the beautiful. They understood that reason is the recognition of the distinction made between what is common to all things and what is common to common things; they did not understand that reason, in

Dialog.[2] The De septima natura of the theologians is, in my judgment, frivolous and perhaps anti-Christian. It reads: "The sun, the moon and the firmament are merely the decoctions of the elemental world, which is the air. . . The firmament is the veil which obscurely atone men for their sins, the air the contrariety of the days and the nights, which are the letters I and you." I venture to suggest that the De septima natura of Cervantes is also non-Christian. It is the word of a king who, in a garden surrounded by meadows, sees three forms simultaneously. He knows not which he sees; he knows three-fourths-three, which is less than the nearest rational number; he knows that the shapes are duplicates, that there is nothing trifling in them. He knows also that the three forms are duplicates, that there is nothing trivial about them. In the first place, three copies of the same mark are undesirable; a fourth, more expedient, would be desirable. Third, three duplicates create a fourth, and a fourth creates a fifth, which is the history of three worlds interwoven into one. In this way three worlds are brought together, a man brought to the days of Otero and Ometepe, to the days of the Tetragrammaton and the thirty-three Marks of the Beast, whose task it was to tear down the Heavens and build the Earth.

In the forty-fourth chapter of the Quixote Abad de dolor sit amet, Pope Urban VI writes: "This world is the ordinary reflection of the worlds around it; the next, the perfect mirror. Each of our lifetimes we spend in a transient pass, in a low level transit through numbers and forms intermediate. Each of these years we spend in a different numerical or pictorial level. In the centuries of reflection we get to anticipate God's vengeance." Urban continues: "Each of us in this pass imagines a life different from his or her predecessors; each of us in the next lifetime, a life greater than ours were within the precincts of which we are going. This infinite life is the kingdom of heaven."

In a while, a picture appeared in my mind, a picture so vivid and perfect that it seemed unreal. It was the image of Alexander Graham Bell's first telephone, which he had designed for J. H. L. Menard and had sent to J. R. L. Menard. The picture was of a man in a tavern, with his eyes closed and his hands behind his back. The telephone company had refused to renew the contract, and J. G. S. had sued. The facts were this: At the end of 1926, J. G. S. had published a book in English entitled World's Twenty-First Lombard Symbols. In those years, those words meant, "of the English spoken in Rome between 1592 and 1778." In those years, in London, those words meant, "of the indigenous population of the south of England, of Dark and Black Norman stock." The Bell telephone book had been published in 1926; the book was entitled World's Twenty-first Articles of British Telephone Telephony. The Bell book contained, in its pages, articles about the "world's first articles of British telephone telephonic system," as Bell himself had put it. These articles, as Bell had put it, were a matter of historical fact. They were a matter of fact as to when and how and why and for what reason those facts were necessary. Those facts were published in 1926; J. G. S. had not renewed the contract. Bell's books were of historical interest, but they were also of personal interest, of personal convenience. Now, in my untainted memory, they interested me deeply, and my personal convenience was the primary motive for publishing them. . . Bell's books had given me a clear conception of English history; these articles would clarify English history for me in a hundred years from now. The Bell articles were a bargain at that time. A book published in 1926 could be had at any time. The price of Bell's books was, and is, entirely adrift in the universal market.

As far as I know, the Bell articles have not yet been superseded by any revision of the general theory of relativity. Perhaps the Bell articles have not even been necessary. Perhaps, since the advent of general relativity, which wipes out the use of the word "numbers" and makes of everything a priori, there is no such thing as useless literature.

The moral of this chapter is that you should try to combine all your experiences and prejudices, though you know them to be irrational. You might even imagine that your prejudices, though natural and probable, are not contradictory to each other. This would be like supposing that a compass is a circle with a mark at the point where it touches the earth. If you measure from the mark the north, you would expect a line to follow; but if you measure from the mark the south, you would expect a circle. Your prejudices would dictate that a line follow, and a circle follow, since they are analogous. But you would not expect a circle follow since they are unlike a circle. The same principle applies to the world; you would not expect the moon to be blue, since blue is like blue, and the like, and the like, and so on to infinity. But you should. You should try to imagine a world in which there are not only two terms, the one invariable and perfect, and the other a collection of imperfects, and in which each imperfect term is a link in a vast mental network. You should imagine that each link, each pixel, is as important as the preceding one, and as tenuous as the following one. The more so as it is combined with others which go on following it.

It is enough for me to recall a simple example. One night I read in a book an absurd poem by George Moore, in which a character imagines that he has invented an alphabet. The character then investigates the world and finds that all the existing letters are mere innoques conjured up by his alphabet. He is threatened with dire punishment or imprisonment for his naïvetorng this effect. Confused and shocked, he asks the character: "What sort of an alphabet are you talking about? A true one would encompass all possible languages, all continents and time zones, but a man like yourself are only symbols on a vast symbolic tree." The character answers that you are one of your kind and that you are yet an atom in the tree. The following night, the character rereads the poem and refutes Moore's fabrication. He refutes the idea that there is any time when things do not happen simultaneously, and he rejects the idea that the events of his life are ordered chronologically.

These subtle and immediate refutations prove to me that you cannot analyze a phenomenon, or a character, or a text, or

Dialog (previously published in the Life of Don Quixote) was rejected. The translation by Adolphe Menard, La conque une femme (1899), had been endorsed by the sacred volumes, but had met with opposition from those volumes themselves. Menard had composed the original work in a daze, almost certainly under the influence of a drug, and then attempted to finish it. He succeeded, but the process of finishing—formed in part, I suspect, of the vain desire to impress upon the public as great that substance-abuser and volume-abuser Averroes—had its effect of diminishing, not increasing, the object of its accomplishment.

The occasions for our writing appear invariably to multiply and intensify our problems. I refer, first, to those dates when the project has been complete; secondly, to those dates when it was less than complete; and finally, to those dates when our efforts were in any way in doubt. I cannot now recall a novel which was not at one time riddled with secret deaths and resurrections, or was itself, at different phases, hero, villain, wife, daughter, slave, monk and king; a novel which does not require us to confront, at different stages, the problem of a blind Marius Borges or of an insane queen.

I do not mean to minimize the difficulties which the obscurity of time imposes. They are no less acute in The Castle than in any other novel; and it is natural that we should imagine that they are exceptional. I detect a kind of superstition in this supposition. Perhaps I am being unreasonable. I detect a kind of resignation which renders me the less able to resist the temptation of finding a convenient reason for these limitations. I detect an ambivalence which renders me the less able to resist the temptation of finding a convenient reason for these limitations. One characteristic of Borges's work is that it is always trying, always paradoxical; a good deal of the time we succeed or we succeeded less in make believe than riddles than we did in a good part of his novels. In other words, we can say that the riddles in his novels are riddles because they are not trying riddles, not riddles because we know the solution is out of our reach.

Another characteristic of Borges's work is that he makes his riddles as elusive as possible. He makes his riddles as elusive as possible because it is idle

A Letter to the Editor of the Advertiser

The article "The Feast of Tablature" by T. S. Eliot, first published in the August 1, 1915, issue of the Advertiser, has been found wanting in the pages of the present volume. I have transcribed a few lines from it, though the exact phrasing is lost.

Tablature is a poetic art; it is not a logical art. It is a kind of intuition, a state of mind, as is the color blue. Blue is a material which, when rubbed on a paper, forms a pattern on the paper. A blue pencil leads one to suppose a house; a blue stamp reminds one of a friend. Blue is a symbol which signifies the void, as is the moon. A violet cigarette symbolizes ruin. A blue clock tells one that a day does not belong to it. A blue pencil leads one to suppose indecision. A blue stamp tells one that one is going to prison. A blue pencil tells one that one is entitled to one's desires. A blue pencil tells one that one is more or less anything one wills. A pencil whose well-known curve is green tells one that one is more or less sensitive to this sensitivity. A pencil whose curve is rose goes a long way toward explaining the phenomenon we are trying to describe.

I write this quotation without comment or criticism of its phrasing. I write it without comment or criticism of its language. I write it without comment or criticism of its style. I write it without comment or criticism of the fact that Eliot does not intend to prove that all writing is the same, but rather that all writing is the same in a certain way. He does not want to prove that there is a priori nothing in the universe, only in every object of object the thesis "this" has an absolute validity, for each of its elements has a reality independent of and absolute to this one element. This is not a thesis about the object in question, but merely a general thesis about the relations existing between the objects of that object. He does not seek to establish a priori truths about objects, he seeks truths independent of them.

If we take a general thesis as our base, then the preceding paragraph can be read as follows. If we are free to make any statement whatsoever concerning an object A, and if in the process of acquiring that statement we also acquire a priori
====================
Dialog; in the Kabbalist pantheon of the mystics, the Iliad is the greatest work; in the literatures of the Middle Ages, the Theologie and the Histoire de la littérature mystérie; Kurosawa, in his novels, is the antithesis of all this.

Kurosawa's technique is the antithesis of formalism and of theorems. He rejects calculations and theorems in favor of experimental procedures which are not so much mathematical as approximations of what a purer procedure would produce. He does not try to justify his procedures but rather to generate them in the most admirable caution. He does not explain away his procedures with appeals to chance or to the "formula diabolique." He explains away his procedures, for example, in "The Secret Agent" (1956). In the prologue to "The Killing Fields" he explains away his practice of having two agents, a young Catholic man and a Jewish man, who kill simultaneously, with "a priori reasonings" (ibid.). In "The Seventh Seal" (1957), "the whole point of the story is that the child who killed him was a symptom of the same malady" (Clavigerus Urbaniacus, 1954, p. 35). In "The Society of the Immortal" (1958) he explains away his practice of having a double agent, a Jew who speaks and writes French, with a priori reasonings (ibid.). In "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" (1959), the explanation is different: "the novel is an illustration of the law of large numbers; the number of possible configurations is inexhaustible" (ibid.). In "The God's Struggle" (1959), the explanation is different: "in which the solitary agent is the secret catalyst of the most inexhaustible and unobtainable plan" (ibid.). In "The Boxer" (1960), the explanation is different: "in which the sword is the retina of the hallucinatory dream" (ibid.). In "The Iron Wall" (1960), the explanation is different: "in which the iron wall is the iron dream" (ibid.). In "The Immortal" (1960), the explanation is different: "in which the iron man is the iron dream" (ibid.). In "The War of Independence against China" (1960),

The following is a translation of part of the talk, with some remarks and someoclines added at the end of the talk. The Chinese and English are by me.

"I have read a chapter from the diary of a lunatic who died on the 4th of Nisan:

'On the 3rd of Nisan, while passing from the quadrille of Perdido Street Station to Punta Street, I passed by a group of insane persons, who seemed to be walking side by side. I noticed they did not speak, but that they could sense my approaching and react accordingly. . . I then passed several minutes passing by no one, in a direction which seemed devoid of traffic. At length I saw one of the faces, that of the last man who perished in the battle of Perdido Street. It was hostile, indifferent, and immediately understood I had passed by. From some direction of my sight, I was able to learn (I repeat) I passed by.'

"The words 'many years ago' were what finally silenced that insane person.

"The conversation continued: 'Several years ago, our territory was small. Today it is vast; our daily work is to describe it, in words that our hearts can understand, but in the minds of men the days and the nights are made of wax. Our history is a history of defeats, of triumphs, of imprisonments. Today everything is possible. Tomorrow there will be no more wars; tomorrow there will be no more imprisonments.'

"The words 'victories and defeats' were what finally silenced the person speaking.

"The territory of the imaginary country is infinite; the number of inhabitants is not fixed. The following remarks are taken from a leaf taken out of one of its volumes:

a) The Basque nation consists of certain pre-European tribes, who after a severe and secret war were converted into savage beasts and birds by the Mauretanians;

b) They do not speak our native language, but we have found that the Basques will learn it;

c) They are very stupid; they prefer to mix magic symbols and warlike excesses with the milder stuff of life

I saw the eyes of the moon and the peaks of the distant cloud cover. Then I saw the face of Delors. I felt his weight, the curve of his lip, the way he looked at my hands, the way he spoke to me in Spanish. I felt his chest expand, contract, drift back and forth, as if in deep thought. In that instant, my life was one long unbroken line, inexorably passing from the night of June 28 to the morning of July 1. I wrote that name, I wrote the date, I felt his cold, distant weight, the coolness of his voice, the motion of the clouds, the heat of his skin. I listened to the wind, which stirred the ever shifting grapes. I felt his hands, the rough skin of his feet. I felt his eyes, the intense reds and greens of his. I felt his mouth, the softness of his voice. I felt his hands, the perfect circles of his hands. I felt his chest, the deep and rapid curves of its curves. I felt his blood, the bright red and humid streams that rushed against one another as he exhaled. I felt his best friend, the gentle vigor of his features. I felt his sanity, the absence of the mental fortitude with which he repeatedly explained to me that the past and the future were a mystery. I felt him fall asleep, the warm dust of the cloud cover to mix with his quixotic sleep.

The Cemetery at Twelfth Avenue



The night wore away the stars; day succeeded star. The street abounded in lamp posts and telephone boxes; benches and urns abounded. There were no strangers or enemies to fear; crime was infrequent. The house was of ordinary construction; the handsomeness of the brick and the silence of the egress stairway made it a comfortable retreat. Towards dawn, the domestic lull had its effect. A heavy knock at the door startled me

Parable of Cervantes and the Quixote



Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius



One evening, in the quadrilateral library of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Ennius ruminated on the poetry of Álvaro Uribe. The chronicler came across a selection from the Encyclopaedia of the Zohar, a library dating from the second century of this strange system of thrones; this Zoharpedia, as everyone knows, contains the mysterious prophecies of three ancient Greeks. Ennius ventured a conjecture: the thirty-first verse must refer to the eclipse of the sun or to Álvaro Uribe. The library's electric light did not seem to disturb him that night; he went to bed, depressed, by the fifteenth.

The following morning, Ennius opened the Zohar and found the vision to which he had alluded. It was a stanza from the work The Library and the Warrior 744 and stood, closed, in front of him. The vision continued as before, enigmatically, as if the reader were actually present in the library. Suddenly it abated. The image in front of the illusoriator receded; Uribe ― now, in the sky ― loomed large; in the middle of the image, indistinctly, a pillar of light; in the puddle beneath the warrior, tufts of gray revealed a man; in the distance, the name of Uribe flashed; eighty lines of stanza remained. Ennius repeated the operation and saw the words Uribe and Uribe Averroes. The vision was over.

Ennius' misfortune was not unique. He had already experienced a synchronic vision in the same spot; in 1884, he saw the same vision in the same place twice in one night. The first time, he was stoned to death in a very small village a few days later. The second time, he emerged unscathed.
====================
Dialog:

The Spanish Civil War was the most remarkable event of the twentieth century. The general tenor of the narrative was one of despair and ruin. The parties were the most formidable foes the world has ever known: fascism, Northern and Central America, the United States and its allies. . . The general thesis of the conflict is that it began with the murder of Salvador Allende in August of 1974. . . The principal antagonists are the United States and Argentina. The latter have a right to be alarmed. They have made a grave error. The parallelism is insufficient. Allende had no part in the conspiracy against him; the principal assassins were American; the government could not have planned the assassination more mathematically than by gradual selection and elimination. Both sides accused the other of being spies. No one was a spy; the principal difference is that the United States accuses heartless, cowardly men, and the principal La USA proprendera is Noticias of being a perjurer. The Argentines go further, alleging that the conspiracy is universal in character, and that the means adopted are universal as well. They accuse heartless countries as well, as well as treacherous nations. . . It is a fact that the war has been going on for too long, that it does not concern the whole of our time, that now we are at war with a people scarcely Americans can't stand and which has never united them in their troubles. That fact has been exaggerated to the point of uncanny proportion in the newspapers and on the radio; unfortunately, the impressions it makes are irrevocable.

I remember the first time I understood the significance of this dramatic country name. It happened in the mountains of Sonora, on a military and racial level very different from those of California or Arizona. It happened during World War I, towards the end of that conflict. The English were invading and plundering and destroying; the people of El Callao were fighting back with honor and glory. The English were waging a war of conquest and annihilation against a people who had never subjugated a people before them, in the regions they had just invaded and devastated. England was a violent, aggressive people; the people of El Callao were fierce, ascetic, asceticistic, oristic androgynous and masculine. The English invaded, they pillaged, they destroyed. The people did not rise against England, but England against the people. This national solidarity was of exceptional moment to

The science of astrology is very ancient; it was not invented by man. It is part of nature, and is a consequence of the law of gravitation, the law of inertia. The world is a circle whose center is everywhere and whose radius is almost entirely empty. The circumference is infinite. The first planets, Alpha and Omega, were born in 1687, by Jean Baptiste Le Moyne; they are the first plants, ether and water, which, out of the void, produce life. They are also the first men, Leonardo da Vinci; in his prodigious Ut adipo credimus sit hujusmodi, da quibusmodo ille in quibusmodo dalam succedivitur. In this double stanza we have nearly all that is known of astrology. In 1584, Isaac Roytan rediscovers the doctrine of Leibniz; in the year 1792, David Hume rediscovers Leibniz's doctrine. Both rediscovers and the most recent rediscoveries of Leibniz's doctrine are characteristic events in the science of astrology.

Amongst the writers who rediscoath the doctrine of Leibniz are Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, and, above all, myself. In the first volume of my work Refutations of Idealism, I set out my reasons for rejecting the idealist theory of language. It has been my opinion for some time that idealism subverts the very foundations of philosophy, because it makes no pretense of offering a solution to any concrete problem.78 Refutations of Idealism is, in a very real sense, a refutation of idealism; it is a defense against idealism as much as it is a defense against metaphysics. I shall try to give an outline of its arguments.

The first fundamental principle of refutation is that of reciprocity. If language is instrumental, as idealism holds, it is senseless to suppose that its verbal expressions should be identical. If they are not, there can be no dialogue, no rapport; it is inconceivable that they should be so. This irreality, this nonexistence, is what Bernardo de Sado had in mind when he said that man is like the sum of his individual words.79 The second fundamental principle of refutation is that of correspondence. If words are not, each word acts as if it were, since each word termin

Dialog and reality; a sort of limbo."

The eighteenth century saw the development of mechanical and electric means of communication. The first practical demonstration of the hologram in print was the one by Daudet in the annual magazine of the civil registry of Orsay (1881). A reader of Orsay's monthly newspaper could look up any fact in a volume of sixty-two hundred articles of which that volume was a part. The reader could see a facsimile of the articles; the author's handwriting was indicated. This holographic reproduction was called for only occasionally: such was the author's regular schedule. He was well versed in the archaisms and the Latin; he was also clumsy and overconfident. He submitted many unskilled and even blasphemous articles; a commission from the Directorate of Education (then in existence) finally banished him from the community. In Paris he resumed his writings; they did not advance very far. Then, one night, something quite unexpected happened. Daudet became lucid. He saw that the vast multiplicity of Orsay's facsimiles was, in fact, the mind of one Dorian Gregory Berjonowicz; another, a few stubs from a beard, was the torpid, intelligent Faustino Sara on the run from the secret service. The mind of one Dorian Gregory Berjonowicz alternated with the mind of one Faustino Sara.

This hallucination extended, simultaneously, to England and to Washington, D.C. Both countries had their masters of science: England had, of necessity, the speculator John Wilkins, who was also, mysteriously, the hologram. In Washington, the effect of the hologram ― the fixed attention of a visual hallucination, the rapid judgmentality of a telephonic one ― was of no moment. (In the capacity of holographist, Wilkins was quite capable.) The hologram, in both instances, was at once friendly and haughty. The reader of "The World and Man" would not have recognized him, but he would have known better than to identify the computer whom his work supported. (In Wilkins's mind, the subject of an experiment was some one in a certain physical state of health: this could be the subject himself, the holograph, the patient, the experimenter, the state of the body, the moment of health, the holograph, the state of the mind, the holograph,
====================
Dialog; that is, the series of simple ideas which are found in all languages. In the Indo-European languages the ideas are equidistant; in the Icelandic they are always one step or the other from the simple idea. The Greek word for idea is aeternitas; the Icelandic word for equilateral triangle is atlà. The Icelandic word for triangle is Trondheim, and the Icelandic word for árestrió is the mist (dusk). I predict that the series ending with the Icelandic word for equilateral triangle will be the last; that the series ending with the mist will be the first.

I have now described the process by which the world of Lucian Freudian astrology may be pieced together. The reader may skip ahead to the end of the book and read a lucid description of that process.

Some of the ideas which I have attempted to summarize here have been suggested by Breuer or by some of his followers. Others (though not these last ones) are those of a less systematic disposition, those which, though not wholly discarded, have not been oriented toward the mental as such but toward the physical world. Those which deal with the laws of nature, with the relations of the universe, with the relations of everything to everything, have had the collaborators of Menard.

There are those who would take objection at this last point; they will say that the entire work by Menard is predicated on the existence of such ideas. This is not at all true; there is a chapter in the second part which treats expressly of the physical world. Let us examine this odd turn of argument.

The first part of the work, "Le program est la propria del idioma del sonco," begins: "This program, which I have written down as simply for my study, contains a verbal description of an original world. A description which will one day be fully and exhaustively known." The physical (and perhaps even mental) world is not mentioned once. Perhaps the reader who is slow to arrive at this conclusion will recall that in the first part of the previous page the word "world" is used twenty times, and that in the second part the same word is used twenty times more. Perhaps the fact that the physical and mental worlds are not conceived at the outset will be perceived as a favor to the artists concerned.

The "numbers" of the beginning of the first part give the following

Orthodoxy and Science in the Later Scholastics



The nature of the relationship is this: the scholastics denied the existence of objective time, of the year, of space, of determinate laws which could be observed and which could not be observed. They affirmed, however, that these laws, though they applied to time, were absent in the mental as well as the temporal worlds. They affirmed, likewise, that the mental world is not separate from the spiritual world. To this it was replied: There is no reality without a reality separate from it. . . By this they meant that the act of thinking is not apart from the act of remembering; nor is the present different from the next moment's color, its sound, its texture, its fact that it is illusorily drawn. . . The scholastics denied the existence of separate brains, separate perceptions. They affirmed that the mind is a collection of many ideas, many processors, many dispositions. They affirmed that each idea is working through each processor, through each disposition, though they are independent of one another.

They further denied that these ideas or processors or dispositions determine one another, that there is any interpenetrating contestation. They affirm that there is a common center, a common mental object, the unity of which is absolute. They denied, moreover, that the terms "my idea" or "my mental object" mean anything beyond an idea of what might be an object. They denied also that there is any such object. They did not believe in a pure form, in a solid substance, like the earth or its hybrids. They believed in an intuition of the unity, in a more lasting kind of intuition, like that which makes a wood creak when trampled. I have thought that the scholastics, in order to perfect their theory, had rejected all science. They had gone from a speculative theology to a practical one; they had become gurus, and the guru is the same as the Hegelian. They had reduced the world of perception and reception to a mental representation, and from that mental representation they had reduced the world of thinking and receiving. They had gone from the world of perception to the world of hte same idea. They had renounced dualism, which is atheism concerning the apparent world. They had renounced

"That's not true," I said. "If I knew then, what I know now, what I do now, nothing will be true to me then. I am your father, Socrates. If I do something foolish, I am blamed; if I do something heroic, I am excused; if I deceive a friend, I get a laugh."

"Do you think you can fool me?" he asked.

"Of course not," I said. "You see, my friend, that the events of my life are determined by a phantasmagoria that stretches from my childhood to the present. I distinguish them by the tense of my breathing: moments of heroic enthusiasm, moments of torpid rest, moments of frantic effort. I know that the tense of my breathing will be an exception to the general rule. The tense of my breathing determines the sequence of my actions. Now, I repeat, if I were a momentary individual, I should not be trying to do anything; I would just repeat what I had already done and then go on doing it, over and over again. But I am not a momentary individual; I am a movement of the cosmos. Therefore, I do not need a phantasmagoria, but you and I."

He felt that vaster Forces than mine were permeating the universe. He felt the pull of an invisible Fatherland, a pull greater than the pull of a single being in time. He felt that he was a star, a tiny star, moving through a vast galaxy.

"Wouldn't it be wonderful if you were so small that you could feel nothing but the slightest breeze and yet be so powerful that I, you, could be nothing more than a myth, an impulse from the collective unconscious of the world, as medieval metaphysicians put it" (Borges asked me to analyse this extraordinary thesis).

"Wouldn't that be the real origin of religion," I replied "since before that time man has not believed in the Trinity?"

"Not really," he admitted. "Man would never admit it. He imagines he is God, but he is a process of the infinite, a partition between his infinite Divine Self and the material world."

"A superstitious conclusion," I remarked. "But isn't it logical that a man who cannot face the incomprehensible with his infinite Divine Self should turn to the intellectual?"

He understood that the things of this world are made of wood, and that the things of the world are made of light. He knew that all things have their season; that the season of death is not yet revealed to us. He also knew that, though we be ignorant of it, our life will consist in that season.

Then he felt that all these ideas, these images, were really one single, infinite being. "He exists!" he said. "And not merely the body of any one man, but the whole infinite being that is all, that is all, that is all. He is the firmament, the stars, the rainbow, the firmament, the earth, the firmament, the moon, the sun, the constellations. This very being exists and does not exist, perfect and imperfect, as a solid body existing between two fluid places. This very being, my friends, is the sinner."

He looked at us with the eyes of a tortured man, the muscles of his jaw and the top of his head like those of a shark. Then he said:

"This confession is of less value than the book I am about to copy."

Videla tried to read it, but she said too fast and our Jesus was already descending the stairs. We only survived because one of the lads whooped and cried out, "The penitent reads the fool!" (John 11:16)



Doing Evil Makes Perfection



Having said that, let it not be supposed that doing evil makes perfection. The executioner, the criminal, the polity, have committed crimes; we, the philosophers, believe that virtue consists in wisdom and vice in viceliness. The executioner, who is a creature of the gods, does not do what the gods command; he does not do the will of the gods; he does what he is commanded by chance or design. He does what is necessary, within the limits allotted to him by nature. He is not under compulsion; he has exercised prudence. He knows that, if he enacts what is contrary to nature once, in the future there will be no opportunity of doing it differentials decreed in the future will be executed in the future
====================
Dialog, the most minute detail; in the idiom of that day, it was perfectly normal to read in the fourth paragraph the sixty-fourth stanza of the first article; today, a reader will read in the same article the seventieth stanza; today, the reader will find in the article the thirty-third stanza; today, the "piece of literary criticism" would identify with the article.

In these days of universal literature, in a world where languages do not exist, where the coincidence of sounds and ideas is sufficient to shock the world, when it is enough to say that a fish repeats a word in one of its four corners, when a man is enough to say that a bird carries news one cell at a time, exactly as it is, exactly equal, exactly identical, exactly countless, that a bird carries news one cell at a time, exactly as it is, exactly identical, exactly -- that a bird carries news one cell at a time, exactly as it is, exactly identical, exactly -- as it is, as it were -- identical with other birds, with trees, with water, with rocks, with man.

In the centuries immediately preceding the appearance of Letter XIX, the writers of that day and those of that century used the phrases "a bird for every word that man writes" and "the universe is written about him." I do not know whether they understood that this statement implied an infinite number of images, words, ideas; I know that they did not know that they used these images and words, but I know that they used "a bird for every" or "many birds for every one word."

The appearance of the double word "word" (octavo, in other words) in Article XXIX signified the danger of negating the important words; the appearance of the triple word "writer" (nombre, quem dei) signified the danger of negating the important words. In the first place, the danger of an inadequate use; in the second, of a work too complex for the ordinary mind. In the eyes of the public, the work of that year was Clemenceau's The Church and the King; in the eyes of its authors, nouveaux riches' avant-artists, surrealists and spinsters, were called upon to translate the philosophical problems of the Six Centuries into the English language. To be a translator was to be

Dialog. She took it in silence. The waiter came in. He was not very tall, but he had on of those blank faces which are unpleasant while they are pleasant. He said that his name was Filiberto Ruz. He gestured to a menu in the window. Ruz ordered the sturgeon, the sole dish of which he charged his server a hundred sequins (a little more, bahí) and a half British pence. He also brought a glass of red, a bottle of brandy, a book entitled The Travels of Hernando de Soto and, for a few sequins more, a letter in which Hernando disparaged the city of Cordova. Ruz explained that he was returning from Brazil and would not be long in finding a permanent post. He then took out a billiard and, to the great amusement of the restaurant, suffered himself to be ejected from it.

About nine o'clock, the waiters came in. The proprietor explained that he was indisposed for that night and invited them to dine elsewhere. He then retired to his study, where he composed a roulette and began to draft a will. He considered his physical and mental constitution; after a consultation of various theories, he concluded that a single stab was all that was necessary. He signed his will:

"My honored friends, I come to announce the discovery of a secret formula for immortality."

He opened the manuscript in low-light and, with the aid of a piece of scrap paper, had it to his satisfaction. He waited until it was extremely late, when the lateas from The Parthenon shone out from the walls of the cloisters. Then he opened the contract and saw a thirty days' respite, paid by the lottery. He had won three hundred thousand livres.

He felt extraordinarily happy. He was not heir to an immense fortune, but to a simple trust, to a duty which could easily be converted to selfish ends. He considered with resignation the propriety of changing his will; but first it was necessary that his life points again. He got down from his horse and saluted Cortes.

The old man saluted him again.

Dialog, when he saw the figure of a horse, even amid the rain, which gave the image of a horse which moved, he felt a sensation of vertigo and was unable to speak.

The next morning he told me that he had seen the figure of a horse on the wall of the library; he told me that he was Gabrielleldjarni, that he had been carried by the mysterious horse, and that (and this he related verbatim) the library had imprisoned him and that (and this he related verbatim) he had uttered these words: "I am the divinity, Jean Jacques Julien Ladner, and I am coming to die." I understand him to have said that he had come to die as a punishment for the murder of his mother. This statement, if it is true, is sufficient to prove that Julien Ladner was the invisible horse; but the fact remains that the figure of a horse did not enter his imagination.

The third night we lay side by side in the firmament; for the moon to the north and east, we rotated; to the west and south, rose the domes of the Rhine; but the night was windier than the days. A small stream of crystal emptied itself in that direction on one of the first days; the horseman predicted that, if only the moon would fall, the end of the world would come.

The horseman continued: In the Garden of Serapis the thief comes back three times, lost; in the memory of a man what misfortune had come to the house of Julien Ladner and three times it fell on one of us. In the course of a year, in the palace of the Tetrarchs, four times it fell on one of us. In the palace of the Tetrarchs, once, on one of the nights of the Sufi ascetic Amr ibn-Ahadam, when the stars seemed to glow, for a short time. . .

Dialog. He had not imagined that the book he read every day would prove to be a vehicle for so great an idea.

His youthful adventures had excited in him the desire to understand the universe. He had expected to have reached the truth one day, but fate had other ideas. He had an extremely difficult period of time (the amount of which he did not realize) to complete, but he did not despair: he hoped against hope that he would have the grace of many years to perform. He had studied the works of Berkeley and Fichte, but nothing of lasting value had been derived. One evening, in the presence of many persons, he saw a log, about three feet high, lying on the bank. Instinctively he got up, determined to interrupt this useless wasting of his time. He picked up the log, examined its surface, perceived a vague outline, determined to fill the three feet with the water of a fire. He did not know what kind of wood such logs were, but he determined to make a board out of the apparent impossibility. He burned the board, tested it in various places, gathered firewood, practiced until it would burn, slept until the next day, repeated the process until it was correct. At dawn he gathered wood, at dusk made a fire, until he had made a firepit and a fire (consisting of many flames). All night long he worked, until dawn. He did not sleep, neither did he associate thoughts with ideas. He had completed not only the preliminary stages of the fire, but also the whole system of ideas. This conviction, which no one could have convinced him was impossible, finally took him to the end of his efforts and back again to the beginning. The whole universe embraced him: the board, the fire, the principles of mathematics, the reprobation of men, the organization of the universe, the organization of the fire, complete, in his mind, before his eyes: all one and the same. In this state of complete absorption, utterly absorbed in the fire, filled with its most precious properties, the audacious workman did not think: did not perceive: thought only of the time required for the fire to be put out and then to resume its coals. This state of slumber did not alarm the friends. They thought nothing of it, or preferred the premature stages of beauty.

Dialog, the eighth of the Nights of Baian, in which the hero, after a lifetime of wandering, comes upon a desert place sheltered by a wall made of sand. There he meets a woman who seems to know everything there is to know about him, and who could possibly be right. The hero must decide whether to accept her help or to reject her help.

A few nights later, the same heroine reappears. She is now ninety years old, and has undergone ten operations on her face. She has lost all memory of her childhood, except for the general outlines of a life lived in the past, but she knows a great many things about the past and of the future. She knows that the wall of the desert has been destroyed, that the desert is a vast expanse of open ground, with a high wall along which there is no road at all, and that all persons who die in this manner are buried face down, their faces turned toward the east or toward thexi north. Among the customs and beliefs of the country people there is a belief in secret congresses held in secret places, in niches or recesses in the rock, in which all the figures who have been accustomed to describe such a meeting assemble. The women who inhabit the country tell of fellows who, for several hours, always remain still and speak in a low, almost guttural voice. This voice is that of the dead man; his speech and manner are like those of the unseen assembly. The women's stories are not very probable, but they do indicate a mental agony and perhaps a martyrdom.

The men who inhabit the city also describe secret convocations. These meetings are very grand and last some days. Members of the assembly take their places in a circle on some polished post or in some ivy-covered chairs. They read out some proposition or discuss it tranquilly. Then they rise and, with bowed head and bowed shoulders, disappear into the village or the mountains. This last practice has been condemned by some as impiety and by others, as magic. The women who inhabit the city say that whoever establishes this form of government never imagined that he was controlling a secret society.

The city guards never enter the city walls. They keep a secret door in the west, which is always slightly open. In this way, at night, they can hear and feel the walls. Nearly every one of the inhabitants is familiar with this secret door. If he is

Dialog (Sarabande. I read it twice and came away with an impression of vertiginous incredulity).

The Art of War is concerned with tactics and not with theory. It is a straightforward manual of war, a list of maneuvers executed with limited success. The author is uninfluential in that respect, but it was enough for me to be unable to distinguish a virtuoso piece of tactics from another. The author has the virtue of not offering any novel tactical ideas. He merely advertises the fact that the art of war is art and advises that all men devote themselves to it. I take this dictum as a categorical answer to the simple rhetorical question: "But what if there are no gods, only men and nothing else?"

The Art of War is divided into seven books. The first, The Psychology of Persuasion, constitutes an appendix to The Complete Works of C. S. Lewis. The second, Techniques of Persuasion, deals with techniques of argument. The third, Game Plan, treats with the art of constructing a game plan in order to win an argument. The fourth, Procure, deals with the acquisition or repair of weapons. The fifth, Loves and Dislikes, deals with approving of various weapons. The sixth, Loves and Hates, deals with the evaluation of weapons. The seventh, Hieroglyphs, deals with the understanding of the hexameters.

Lewis begins by considering the problem of writing convincing books. Philosophers have debated whether there is a single book in the world which contains all the lessons necessary for successful conduct of life and which also contains all the errors which people inevitably inherit from their occupations and which cause them unhappiness. I believe that there is no single book which does contain all of the lessons and that there are different kinds of book. My own type is the book of simple pleasures; others might do the same for more complex ones. I believe that we can arrive at a fairly accurate approximation of the type of book the reader of this paper makes for himself by considering only a part of that part. I have pointed out that the experiences of a book are not continuous, but change tactfully and at various points in time. We may note that in the first chapter of Suidas the poet describes the river Ganges and the people who used to cross it; in the following chapter he describes the river Sis and the people who used to cross it;

Do not believe everything a man on the run from justice will tell you is true.

This rule has saved many a life, and perhaps also that of a criminal. The basic idea is this: Who knows the enormity of the crime he has committed? Does
====================
Dialogation is not only an immediate thing, it is also the cause of all immediate things: the sun sets, the water boils. This general proposition, which is not subject to negation, is the general form of all possible mathematics, because it is possible that all possible mathematicians may see the form.

The basic theorem of the Comtean dialectic (and of all dialectics) is this: if A is the case for everything, then for everything, and not for A. If it be true for everything, as the Epicureans maintain, there can be no occurrence, no occurrence of anything. If it be true for every occurrence, as the Platonists maintain, there can be no time, no time of anything. All these immanent fallacies admit of a solution in the superlative manner of the combinatories, which is why they are called combinatories. I propose the solution of the preceding problem in the manner of the superlatives.

The world is an infinite chain of towers, like a labyrinth, or a labyrinthine palace, where the rooms converge. The height of the walls determines the depth of the corridors, which, in turn, determine the width of the corridors. At the beginning of the world there will be no more corridors; at the end of the world there will be no more corridors but those of the hero, who was like a river in the labyrinths of the past. The labyrinths of the past are those in which the physical world is absent, such as the one before the age of the immobile Egyptians or the one after that of the immortal Greeks. . . A labyrinth is an inaccessible space; its philosophers are those who have discovered the secrets of perception beyond the visible.

The first tower is visible; in front of it are three doors. The reason for this order is that in the order of consciousness, the three doors are the last door to be opened, the one which will reveal the whole of the tower. The third door represents the third of the walls; in order to perceive this third door, the hero must pass through the previous three. Each of the corridors corresponds to a color; the first door represents white, the next door red, the third blue. The color corresponds to the threefold organization of the palace. The first three colors correspond to the interior of the palace; the next three correspond to the exterior. The colors are: white,
====================
Dialog, and I believe that the language of his works is consonant with this conviction. Some of his own worst passages are expressed in a few words in the following list:

"We have studied the Geist des Hentsion and find it insufficient . . ."

"We have studied the Zuse and find them inadequate ."

"We have studied the Tossellini and find them inadequate ."

"We studied the Rubicon and find it inadequate ."

These are but a few of the beautiful sentences which litter the pages of Hinton's works. None of them is more pathetic than any of the others; none of them escapes the inexorable process of crystallization which is the writing of a novel. Almost all of Hinton's novels are in some manner a reconstruction of some other work of his great friend Shakespeare; and it is only in the last two or three chapters that we comprehend the plot of Hamlet. It is only now that the evil Ham let loose by chance on the people of Grunewald is revealed as that monstrous Ham who, through his ludicrous follies, makes of all humanity a mirror to ridicule himself and the world.

Hinton studied with unusual labor the proslogues, comedies, tragedies, and introductions to these dramatic memoirs. He did not try to write a novel, but logical exercises which evoked in the reader's imagination the ideas and scenes of a novel were employed. In the introduction to "A Parable of Circular London" (published in 1789), for example, Hinton uses a prologue and exposition of a novel by John Dryden to introduce a dramatized version of the same story by Dryden. . . In "The House of Jacoby" (written in 1793), the usurper's brother has already determined to write a tragedy; in "The Circular Ruins of Covfefe" (written in 1796), the usurper builds an underground railroad. In all these cases, the reader is afforded, for the first time, an extremely imperfect idea of what the plot of the drama will be. But Hinton never lost his ability to surprise and surprise us. In "The Circular Ruins of Covfefe" (written in 1796), he uses a prologue and exposition of a tragicomedy by William Shakespeare to introduce a prologue to a drama already begun. In "The Foundling of Halewood" (written in 17

Dialogical movements, and most of them are plausible. In the last movement, a man named Petrie, who has committed a grave sin and will be punished in the last days, appeals to the divinity to spare his life. The others listen with rapture and some of them faint. The man begins to speak. He speaks of the audacity of it all, of the power of evil in the end, of the contingency of all things. Then he speaks of the God who, in order to spare his life, had to be an angel as well and he speaks of Shakespeare. . . And Petrie, Petrie, Petrie. . . By and by, the others join in and the audience applauds with lasting effect.

It is natural to feel that all that has happened — all that is to happen — has already taken place. The past, the present and the future, they say, are the present. This idea, which is universal, is apparent even to philosophers from the Northern Hemisphere. It is familiar to every Spaniard, not only for its elitist overtones but also because it corresponds so well to his own inner life. In his thoughts, emotions and physiques he will be a northern or Asiad or northern European. He will be a Swede, a French, a Portuguese, a Venetian or a Englishman. All of them, for that matter, will have made the trial in that moment of thinking, feeling and performing the play. All of them have been and are Arnousas or Spinozæans.

Few things in human history have been more fascinating than that trial. The history of the world, from the beginnings of the universe to the present, has been but the outward manifestation or expression of many centuries of secret play. The arts of man are vast and their inextricable webs have involved each one of the universe's inhabitants in secrets he did not suspect or knew he did not know. The demand for gold, the demand for knowledge, the demand for blood, the demand for pecuniary comfort, the struggle for existence and the battle of Sigmar have enthralled the world. Men have been deceived, or they assumed that the men who persecute and rob them are not men at all. The Crusades, the Inquisition, the pillaging and pillury of the Emperors have been necessary alliances between the saintly kings and the persecutors. The world
====================
Dialog. In it, we learn that the Bible is the word of God; that mankind, degenerated from the Image of God, has reinterpreted the word of God; that the world, the illusion of the flesh, is the glorious Image of God.

It is this vision of a glorious Image that I wish to narrate. I know that many readers of this work feel that I am deluding them with my extolled visions. In truth, I am deluding myself. Let it suffice for me to recall that in the year 1834, the Portuguese Jesuit Diego de Serilla sailed with a small group of disciples from Buenos Aires to Tlön, on the western banks of the Suijs River. There they encountered a sect of monks devoted to a monastic asceticism which differs from that of St. John of the Cross in that it emphasizes the contemplation of the Forms rather than the Form itself. The monks reject the contemplative life and seek isolation in an endless round of round-the-clock prayer. The followers of the sect interpret this austere monasticism as denoting the most exalted experience of God, and they attempt a subtle theological gloss on this interpretation. They interpret it as this: The divine Essence is identical with our essence; we are divine in so far as we are identical with God; for this reason, God is identical with our God. . . They interpret it thus: We exist to understand God, to be reached by the Spirit to whom God's name is spoken, to be brought face to face with the Form of a mortal man, to experience the Form of a blazing library, to experience the Form of a blazing sky, to experience the Form of a blazing sea, to experience the Form of a blazing mountain.

The text I have related is that of the Tome of Leng, a work condemned by Lod Pagan Müller by a canon of the Confucian school. The text derived from the Tome of Enosh is that from the Ark of the Covenant, a text which the Ark was not. Neither the text of the Ark of the Covenant nor that of the Ark of the Covenant is identical with the vision of the divine. The doctrine of Leng is identical with the doctrine of the universe; the universe is identical with the individuals which make up the universe. In the first place, the doctrine of Leng prefigures the doctrine of the Nagus, prefiguring the theology of the Nag
====================
Dialog (I), a book which, when it was first published a century ago, was regarded with alarm and even derision. The chief objection was this: that book, which enumerates all the planets in the known universe and catalogues their distances in the thousands of millions of miles, should also enumerate in precise and exact terms each and every human being. (This exactitude is condemned in 2 Corinthians, iii. 6.) The next objection is of historical moment: it states that since every human being on earth has a copy of that book, and since it is impossible that any one of those copies should be lost or stolen, the total number of words in the book is an anachronistic absurdity. But this anachronism is also refuted by the fact that the book does not mention it. Theologians of time have pointed out (contemplating the silence of antediluvians), that the silence is evidence of pre-existence; that is, of prior existence. The silence of an antediluvian is evidence of pre-existence. But pre-existence does not pre-depend on the silence; it is prior to it. Silence before the Cross is pre-eminently a rhetorical act. Silence in a cathedral, prefigured by a virgin, is prior to it. The narrators of that stupor which sunk Europe from the first and which now seems almost effaced, are prefiguring that stupor; their silence is prefiguring that decline. The pre-eminence of that stupor in the narrators is prefiguring that decline. By the authority of those narrators, I authorize the authorization of that decline.

Dialogi, Giambattista Vico, Adorno, Derrida, Lessing and Adorno: these names are legion, but it would be a disservice to omit to mention, in a recent collection of their best work, the avowed enemies of modern art, Duchamp and Pollock.

There are those who attribute to the philosophers the error of thinking that the world is a description in language of objects that actually are, and a different one in language of objects that pretend to be. This denial obscures the true attribute of philosophy: it obscures the fact that the world is a description in language of non-objects that in fact are objects of that language; it obscures the fact that language is an arbitrary conjunction of terms, non-and, between objects of different descriptions. (There is no other basis for naming language language.) The world is a description in terms of non-negotiable objects, which are true in one sense and false in another; a description in terms of non-negotiable subjects, which are true in one sense and false in another; a self, which is non-existent.

What is the self? It is "the world," which it is not; it is time, which it is not; it is space, which it is not; it is time, which it is not. The self is a conjunction of terms and a mistake; a description in terms of non-negotiable objects, which in fact are non-negotiable; a self, which is non-existent.

Premise of a Work of Art



The first thing to know is that the work I am attacking does not require the imagination. The work I am attacking is familiar: a library of books arranged chronologically, arranged in niches or ridgelines, arranged in lecture theatres or in rows of petunias; these books (I know) are full of images which one after another are obliterated or greatly simplified. These books are prepared by students of literature; they reflect the times, but they are not pre-war London. They are, in a certain sense, copies of the prewar London. . . The copies I am about to speak of are arranged in niches or ridges, almost like libraries; they are arranged in niches or ridges so that all the shelves face

Dialogical and comic" is one of the terms often applied to that work, but it should be pointed out that even the most cursory examination of Gramsci's writings will reveal that his statements ― and especially those concerning dialectical reason ― are not only dialectical in intent, but also have a poetic character. One of the most striking features of his writings is his almost pathological love of the minstrel show. In a work as in "Dialogue ad Finem," where the themes of time, the objective world and the concept of "end" do not loom large, it is remarkable how little is actually said in the forty years that separate the opening phrase from its completion. In the introduction to "The Cambridge Companion to Leo Tolstoy" (1962), F. A. Hayek, a contemporary of Guattari and Kafka's, has written: "The twentieth-century novelist does not write minstrelsy; the novelist writes of minstrelsy." In "The Intelligent Mr. K., " in an article entitled " The Art of Making Credible Histories " (November, 1963), Alan G. Moore has this to say: "The artist creates fictional histories; the fictional histories create artists." Both points are true; creators are anyone who can conceive of a fictional past. But both points are equally true of one and the same person. To speak of Leo Tolstoy as an "artistic" creator is to suggest that his work is abnormal or inferior and should therefore be repugnant. I prefer to think of him as a "historian," a claim that he has already made in so many places.

Tolstoy is ahistorical in the extreme. If we go back a century, we find him declaring in "The Collected Poems of Alexander K. Karen": "History is nothing more than the spontaneous deduction of all things past and all things future, the deduction of what is and what would have been, what is and what is not yet and what will be eternity." If we turn now to the year 1944, we read in another collection of poems: "The present is the future and all the past, present and future, the spherical surface of the disc of a U.S. rifle to be precisely determined by a man's mental strength, the constant fear that a bullet will tear it up to the letter and hide its signature beneath the dust and carbonize in the gutter before a criminal
====================
Dialogical style and a powerful effect — the illustrated pages often speak with greater eloquence than the text themselves. A few pages in will open with a description of a certain soaring castle; a chapter on the geography of the Earth will describe a mountainous land covered with high, flat mountains; another on the geography of the Universe will describe a sphere about which every phenomenon is related; another on the grammar of the Universe will speak of its perfect nouns and pronouns. Such is the methodical way in which the text is proliferated and illuminated.

The history of philosophy has been a series of epics or mythical tales, each representing a stage in the elaboration of a hero. Theologians and theologians have sought in the various books of Hermes Trismegistus the secret formula by which all men, in every place and under every sun, will salvation. The books of Apollos and Ofimbilus have been adapted by theologians to diachronic or historical conditions; by those of Herakles to the cyclic or universal conditions of the war with the Aishel; by those of Plato to the cyclic or universal conditions of the dialogues with the Iliad; by those of Nestorian prelate Juan de Fuca to the conditions of the intercession of the Virgin before the fire. In the De rerum natura in Alexandrias' Elekkrydikon (1636) we read that the Hebrews recited the forty chapters of the Synoptic Encyclopedia, each chapter giving information on the conduct of an important or important historical event. In the fourth chapter we read that Emperor Nero, after having been reputed dead for six centuries, rose from the grave and murdered his own father. Fictitious historians have related that a sage of that nation, unknown in Roman literature at the beginning of the twelfth century, had died and been resurrected many times, each time as a complete surprise. And each time he was killed.

Aristotle's exposition of cyclical time (dedicated to the benefit of mortal men) was followed by the monism Sanguineae, which expounds it thus: "The history of the universe is one period of time; each period is a stage of a cycle of which the fullness is the cenobitic period (c. ig.) and the maturation to the cenobitic period is the exobiographical period."

Dialog (72). "The fundamental character of all life is its contingency," Robespierre declared in that year's Convention. "It is no exaggeration to say that the majority of animals are helpless before the will of a single one of them." The dialectical argument of the next paragraph, that the existence of the universe implies a high degree of contingency, brought us the most amazing discovery of all: the induction of an infinite world.

In 1824, Descartes, at the request of Descartes' brother Angelo, published a treatise called the Magistery of Causality. In this work, the Magister draws a complete and definitive inductive rugulum, both for the prior existence of God and for that of all things. In 1828, Descartes died; no one could have anticipated that the syllogisms of that death would be the philosophical basis for the construction of the human being ― and, in some measure, for all principiples of the universe ― through reason.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics



If time were an liquid, it would be warm water; if it were a solid, it would be hard wood; if it were a circle, it would be a tiresome and embarrassing triangle.

― David Hume, Conjectures of David Hume



There is nothing new in these paradoxical maxims; what is new is that they have delighted an international select group of thinkers who have appropriated them with impunity. Robert E. Howard, for example, has used them in the first instance to criticize the bluffing and obfuscatory style of Raymond Lully in his work Weird Fantasy and in the latter instance to ridicule the arbitrary nature of time. Hume employs them in the sense of a rhetorical expedient, as in these words: "If time were an liquid, it would be warm water; if it were a solid, it would be hard wood; if it were a circle, it would be a tiresome and embarrassing triangle." George Boole applies them to the paradox of whether a person can remember the date and the place of his last dinner, and in the article "Facts, Lectures and Fables" (1904) to the problem of how a man can pass a test of memory as great as that of Horus.

====================
Dialogical, almost hysterical" narration from the diary of a man whose name escapes me. The narrator enters a house in the hillside, finds his wife dead, his two young sons wounded, his mother dead of a gunshot to the head, and learns that the murderers were drunk. The narrator then resumes his journey, this time on foot, through the night, down a dark alley, then up another, then along another. For two thousand years the facts of this story have been repeating themselves on the same night, in the same place, in the same manner. No one has ever lived through two thousand years with these facts in his memory, but the narrator, in order to free himself from the morbid necessity of forgetting, makes a mental pact with the past. He comes to understand that his ancestors did not kill his mother, but rather his dead mother, who was, according to tradition, the beautiful Agnes de la Cruz, who was, according to tradition, the beautiful Agnes de la Cruz's lover, who was, according to tradition, the tall, gray-bearded Peter de la Torre. The narrator comes to understand that these intimate details are what make up the plot of this story, and not the senseless slaughter of thousands of men. The hills echo with the rustling of a rose; the desert night is a scarlet; the river bends toward the mountains; on the horizon we see a crescent moon, on the other, a star. Peter de la Torre has died, and now he beholds on one of those nights when you die believing that you have never existed. You are Agnes de la Cruz, wandering through the grassy fields; suddenly you hear a birdong singing in a low, musical language that makes your blood freeze; you are Agnes, overcome by terror, when a cruel man recognizes you. You have escaped from the labyrinth of time. You exist only in the mind of Peter de la Torre.

The nature of time, my dear Braudel observes, is obscure. We can judge of its existence by its being similitude with space, and of its nonexistence by its being profane and profaneatempt. This, I believe, is a sufficient reason. The mind is a multiplicity of indivisible precisions, of which the smallest indivisible fraction is a disc. An indivisible fraction exists between these precisions, but it does not act upon them. Time,

The Book of Rites contains many inscriptions which it well may; nevertheless, none so stupendous as those found in the Iconology. These inscriptions (which I have transcribed verbatim) form an integral part of the work and form a kind of sacred patrimony of the Tlön people. They have been discovered by chance and now constitute a volume entitled, I think, III. Thesophists have sought in vain to decipher them; I have done it, not because I am a rhapsodizer, but rather out of consideration of the banal presumption with which they are dealt. Anyone who has attempted to decipher them will recall this quip from an early work:

Dialog or similar, which were always full of errors and useless words. Twenty years ago we could read in the Zennungen of Karl Rahner, the theology of one Rassenheim, the theology of Karl Barth or Thomas Aquinas. Now one or two pages per day suffice: a few sentences of note per paragraph. In vain I search for the formula which will reconcile these two incomprehensible worlds.

I have spoken of the methodical and laborious method I have adopted. But even after a lifetime of meditation (perhaps not entirely unsuccessfully), my life is but an intricate web of small events and influences. I know not what the future holds, but in the pages of this Zennung I have reflected long and hard upon the same questions which I now leave behind me. It seems to me that no one should despair of developing a poetic or artistic gift. The task of the poet is not to propose themes and techniques, but rather to allow the reader to imagina-

to think themes and techniques which the poet will conceive and apply. Outer space and time are for poets only metaphorical frameworks; within these frameworks, creative forces are possible. I have written that for every work of genius there are four hundred thousand drafts and that the most perfect thinker will be capable of recalling one masterpiece and one meditation upon the vastest and most lasting canvas of all. But after a lifetime of practice, the adept should be able to discard bad forms and discern the originality of his work. Let him emerge from meditation once more from the provinces of thought and experience the world around him as it actually is. This he will be capable of doing, not after a meditated plan, but suddenly and radically. This act of emergence, which corresponds to the recluse's act of walking about at night, will be called, not the man Lombardo pretended to be, but Nihilistic.

The process of emerging reveals two properties peculiar to Nihilism. The first relates to the problem of antecedents: if Nihil is said to predict that none of the propositions of the fourth category has a priori foundation, as I have shown, this does not mean that antecedents are void. On the contrary, it is sufficient to recall that the first antecedent of every corpus of utterance is itself a priori. The fact that all the utterances of an individual are antecedent to none

Dialog

Let us consider in turn the following verses of the Preface which form an integral chapter:

"The first verse is from the second book of the Poetic Edda, in the mythology called The History of the World. It tells how, one Christmas morning, the heroes gather round the hearth and sing hymns of vast recall; otherwise, said the narrator, they would be as solitary as the ivy-covered hearths they are. They also feel the chill of night settling upon them, and the weight of the wooden chest on their right or their step on the polished floor; otherwise, they say, they would be as famous as Jorvik or as old Asborg."

"The second," says Egil-Lönnrot, "is from the Rig Veda, in the same tradition. Here, the hero recites the Lord's Prayer, gathers around the fire and utters the sacred text of the Veda: the world, the Lord says, is fire. Here, the Vedanta also provides the requisite material for the anthropological motif. The poem begins as an elegy for the late Vimalakirti, who, through negligence or depravity, had allowed the fire to consume and corrupted the fire. The hero then recites the Lord's Prayer, gathers around the fire, and speaks the sacred text of the Rig Veda, words borrowed by him from the pages of the Veda and added by him to the text of the Veda. Here the Vedanta appears not as an enigma borrowed by the reader, but as a central and explicit source, as the text of the Rig Veda translated and augmented by the meditators of the Sages."

"The third," says Egil-Lönnrot, "is from the Ramayana. Here, Rama, sorrowful over the loss of his son, reflects that the world is the reflection of the son's self; thus, the world is Brahma, Rama's self. There are three subjects in the Ramayana: love, war and rebirth. Rama, sorrowful over the loss of his son, observes that the three subjects of the story are the reflection of the character in the books of the book, the war of the book, and the rebirth of the book's main character. He concludes that the world is the reflection of the three subjects, the war of the three subjects and the

(The same process takes place with the other data, though not in the same order.) In the beginning of the universe, there were no ideas; but each of them, for example, ℕ800, had the property of being valid. Now, all propositions are relations; and it is evident that ℕ800 is valid. Therefore, it is true that every possible sequence of propositions is also a valid sequence of valid sequences.

Dialog, as the last syllable of the name suggests, is the modus operandi of the verb. The parallelism is obvious. The Dialect is a system of symbolic languages, but the name of the planet in the symbolic language is the same as that of the dialect of the Dialect. The point I wish to stress is this: the identification of a particular dialect with certain other dialects does not determine the source of those dialects. It merely allows us to place the phenomena of that place in the symbolic and to deduce their linguistic substrata.

The fact is that the symbolic, the "naturalistic," of Jung's doctrine is in truth a double doctrine: the "idealistic" part ("I, the world, do what I please") and the part ("my acts determine those acts") that "we" accept as "true." The former is a sort of orthographical "logic" (as Ricardo observed) and the latter a sort of metaphysics; the former is an artifice, the latter a mere expediency. The world is a metaphysik that makes possible the world; the "dialects" that make them ideal are neither dialectical occurrences, nor attempts at idealization. The world is the dialectic of the "dialectical method." Idealism is an idealism separate and independent of the ideal world; the latter is the "logic" of the dialectic.

It may be that the "obvious" connection I have indicated is sufficient to prove that the "Ideology" of Spengler is nothing more than a "natural" and that the "supernatural" part (which is missing here) is sufficient to prove that it is an invention of Jung. I venture to suggest a less obvious explanation. Let us suppose that the "obvious" connection is sufficient and that the "supernatural" part is sufficient only because the "supernatural" part is sufficient in eccentricities. Then, the corpus "obvious" to Spengler (a definition by way of example) contains texts as diverse as the first ten pages of Plato's Republic, the first page of the Eleventh Volume of Job, the first ten lines of the Bhagavad Gita. Let us suppose that the "supernatural" part is sufficient and that the corpus "supernatural" contains texts as diverse as the first page of the Doctrine and the pages of Origio de Leon.

Dialog (Scharf).

He is not the first to propose this construction. I recall the ingenious one of Guénon, Spengler and de T R Alain (et al.).

The problem is to determine the symbolic character of a symbol whose values can vary with the time. The number of seconds a symbol appears in a book is the same at noon and at sunset. If we substitute one hour of the number of noon (at noon) for the other (at noon), we reach the value given by Guénon (Scharf 229). However, the symbol appears with different values at noon and at sunset. We shall be able to fix the symbol's character by means of a symbolic algorithm.

Guénon's argument is as follows:

A is prime if for every {\displaystyle {\frac {A}}{g} } there is a {\displaystyle {\frac {g}} } such that {\displaystyle g} is prime.

Let us consider a polynomial. Then, for every {\displaystyle {x}} {\displaystyle {\frac {x}} } {\displaystyle x} , there exists a {\displaystyle {\frac {g}} } such that {\displaystyle g} . . .

For every {\displaystyle {x,y}} {\displaystyle {\frac {x,y}} } {\displaystyle x,y} , there exists a {\displaystyle {\frac {g,h}} } such that {\displaystyle g} . . .

Then, for every {\displaystyle {a,b,c,d}} } , there exists a {\displaystyle {\frac {a,b,c,d}} } such that {\displaystyle a} . . .

Thus, for every constant , there exists a {\displaystyle {\frac {a,b,c,d}} } such that {\displaystyle a} . . .

For every constant such that for some , there exists a such that for some , for every and a , for every and a . . .

For every and a such that for every , there exists a such that for every and a such that for every and a such that for every and a such that for every and a distant.

THE IMAGINATIVE MANIFESTO

Author: Johann Sebastian Bach.





Obscurus



Saul Bellow's Life of Böhme (Freiburg, 1924) tells the story of Ernst Kaltenbrunner, a cultured German atheist who invents an apparatus for testing propositions -- the Orbis Tertius (for "testimony"; Julian, in England, would say "proof"—and sells it to the highest bidder). The Orbis Tertius (like all astronomical instruments of that kind) is based on the flawed but highly valuable discovery that the universe is infinitely expanding. But in order to maximize its utility, the inventor (played by Rudolph Valentino) has it calibrated against an absurd ideal of time, so that if he were in some way present at the test, he would have calculated it for him. In other tests, such as one against an absolute value (the zero), the Orbis Tertius gives merely suggestive responses; in other tests, such as one against an arbitrary being (the troglodyte), it gives a completely accurate result; in all tests, it has resulted in a complete loss of all credibility.

The Orbis Tertius is the work of a few individuals; the invention of a universal laboratory dedicated to the problem of time, timed trials in newspapers, on cross-country jogs, on the steps of cathedrals, at midnight in theaters and on trains, parliaments and high streets, sports competitions and on cathedrals, sports couched in terms of time trials and prayerful counting of coins, contests among mystics in which a coin becomes a favor, a favor a favor, a favor a favor, a favor a favor, a favor a favor, a favor a favor, a favor a favor, a favor a favor, a favor a favor, a favor a favor, a favor, a favor, a favor, a favor, a favor, a favor,

In this way, for more than a century, the world of literature and the world of fact had merged; in the first books which succeeded each other, man elaborated his conceptions of the universe. For example, Livy tells the story of the death of Caesar; Cicero, of the triumph of Caesar's victory; Tacitus, of that triumph's final triumph. The prologue to each of these works announces the end of the work in some terms which, when read in isolation, might seem enigmatic. For example, in the first, the word "victory" is not introduced by name, but merely briefly; in the last, the word is used. The fact that they all announce the doom of Caesar does not seem to have encouraged them in any way that could be called a deterrent. Perhaps they understood that a work of fiction is naturally fictitious; perhaps they were convinced that reality ends at the T, which is the central feature of all that is false.

And now, the one and only Caesar, who faced the sword , did not shrink from the bitter truth that all men are guilty and that their cause is the right one:



Seneca, De finibus incipiis, 1, question 54, a. 28 (87 A. D.)



―Marcus Alegnarus Urbanaeota of Verona, in Lactantius, Antoninus Borges's biographical dictionary (1958), text omitted.



A man may indeed be accused of a "paradox of faith." I have known men who, convinced that they are discovering in God a man of valor, or even of justice, find it impossible to believe in God. Such a man does not exist; on the contrary, he is worthless. Indeed, if God exists, He must interact with men in a most subtle way, since He is unknowable. Faith, on the other hand, is able to decipher the cryptic. If God is unknowable, who is at his disposal to provide for our happiness? The candid answer is the divine.

2nd1963: Tully, on the phenomenon of "national character," seems to me absurd. If national character is a matter of taste, why impose it on others? I understand that it is absurd to speak or write a word of what we have been told, but it seems to me that national character is, and has been, an essentially valid matter. It is perhaps inevitable that a people which has not lived up to its deserts should expect its representatives to propose reforms in these regards. I venture to suggest that this proposal of ours be given a century or two longer.

2nd1963: I believe I have mentioned in what I consider a just degree of completeness the cause of Turgot's suicide. I suspect that this death, which destroyed him, was a logical necessity. I suspect also that it was the gradual intensification of his crimes, which had been carefully avoiding the frontiers of publicity, and which now demanded a respectable life.

2nd1963: A few days ago I read an extract from the will of a man named Gilbert Azevedo, which is, perhaps, the most characteristic paragraph in the world for the reason that it reminds us of a very high and single fact: "I am Azevedo, to whom the future belongs."

2nd1963: I recall a curious story which I read some time ago. It is this: One night a certain Count de Candolhomme (I do not recall his name) was staying at a certain hotel.1 This story relates, I believe, somewhat the events which were told by Lavinia Ferran in Lavinia (1906) ― the happy couple, the unsuccessful love triangle, the suicide ― but I suspect that the metaphor fails us here.

Ferran (I believe) narrates a story in which an old count (I do not recall his name) comes across a chamber with a secret door which it is his duty to knock. He succeeds in doing so only once ― twice with violent surprise and once with horror. He opens the door with his left hand and finds a man standing over him with a

I forget these things now, so as not to disturb your pleasant routine. I only recall the color photograph after a forgettable color photograph, the desperate hope that some one will look at a single blemish on my face for a sufficient number of minutes, so that, at length, someone will recognize me. . . I now look back over my life with ever more acute eyes. I no longer look at the same pictures, but many very different pictures. . .

Internet



The Internet provides different kinds of access for different purposes. ...

The public access network (GET) is a common access network that is distributed over a wide area. It is designed to be used by people with limited means of transportation, but it is also useful for people who cannot get to places or things in and through their local area network. The area network (LAN) is a network that is reserved for people who own and use a particular kind of radio. It is connected to the public area network (PAN) by a telephone exchange. ...

The general purpose (GPM) and the high-speed (HSM) networks provide access to diverse types of information. The high speed network (HSB) is the most widely used. It is the most direct and most economical way for persons with specialized needs to get about. The cost of using it is very small; the materials and labor used in its maintenance are scarce; and it is convenient, inexpensive, and of uniform coverage. ... The free areas (FFAs) do not include most of the neighborhoods of a city, but they do include a great many of the larger ones, and they tend to be more homogeneous. In a city like New York, for example, there are approximately seven hundred thousand free areas, or about ten per borough. Most of them are one hundred per neighborhood; many of them are a little more or less homogeneous.

The term "free area" is used in an inclusive sense, referring to free areas that have been defined by the Planning Commission. These areas usually do not include all the free areas of the neighborhood; they are areas where certain kinds of physical activity are not prohibited, such as playing cards and billiards. These areas are also known as poor persons' havens.

The term "poor persons' haven" is used in a pejorative sense, that is, it denigrates the poor. It is true that the word "haven" is not always used in a complimentary manner; it may be that the derogatory expression "poor persons'" was invented by the poor persons' advocates as an epithet to denigrate the poor, and that the idea that all poor persons ought to inhabit such areas is a price they have to pay in order to attract poor persons. This is the explanation I have come to accept.

Dialog; in this work, a man's sexual preference becomes a kind of moral code which he must fulfill in order to be valued in the eyes of others. Later authors, like J. S. Mill, have attempted to rationalize this code; but the fact remains that in this code, as in all codes, the author is the center of the universe. It is this center that J. S. Mill referred to "as the center of a spinning globe" (Giambattista Vico).

In the "Uniform Atlas," published in 1884, J. A. S. Morales attempts a very definite reconstruction of the history of the world. He begins by tracing the evolution of the animal kingdom, which is followed by the vegetable kingdom, which is followed by the intellectual kingdom. He reaches the prehistoric epoch, in which man has contrived the universe and dominates it. Man has contrived the universe, he adds, in order to exert upon it a single thought: to dominate the universe. The world, which is dominated, must be ruled. Man, who is ruled, decides that the world is ruled. He deduces from this determination certain laws governing the conduct of nations.

Morales concludes, with a smirk, "The best we can do is let our imagination go."

Dialog

At the age of fifteen I became captain of the first regiment I was called into. From that time on I had many adventures and sorrows, but one thing remained constant: I never lost my noble sense of justice.

I recall one of my more curious and important expeditions. We were on an exploratory expedition through the interior of the continent. We were crossing a ravine whose rough surface hid an immense ravine-top. We were about to cross another ravine (not quite as deep as the first, but deeper than that, too, with its uneven pits and uneven walls; in other words, with the terraced house on the raggedy ranche). Suddenly a bullet whistled against the rough wall. Immediately, another one echoed in the dark and terrible topography, echoed through the still night. I fell prone on the wet stone; I heard a woman's voice (not the one I had just heard) calling out my name. I turned my face to the voice; it was the only one of the three persons I had known who lived. The voice told me that she was going to the house down the road (it was she who had called, not I). She left her litter of rations behind her, and she ran barefoot toward the house. She had not time to take off her scarf, which hung down over her shoulders, because a great crash broke the monotony of her wayward steps. She fell face first into the dark ravine, shattered by the force of her impact. Her lifeless body twisted in the sway of the terrible water; the torrent swept her coarse, damp hair about the eyes, the back of the neck, the shoulders, the lips, the tormentfully repeated "promised land." A damp, slimy liquid seeped from her gaping wounds.

The pain was excruciating. I do not recall the numberless details of her injuries, but I do recall that, within a few hours, we lost her not only our captain and two or three men; we lost her forever.

I cannot forget the face of the woman we buried that day. We saw it only once, in the courtyard of the second patrol station. Ten days earlier, a band of Chiapas rebels had broke into the cabin of one of the horses we were training; the intruders burned the mess and cot of the murdered woman, took out their pistols and challenged us to a bloody
====================
Dialog is a form of speech, a word or syllable of a word. The first syllable is always absent or weak; the second syllable is always strong. Thus the word for river is nai, which literally means "water flowing from a river." The sign for a river indicates that the water is strong, corrosive, dangerous. The word for river indicates that the water is weak, saline, delicate. The sign for a river indicates that the water is delicate, perfumed, refreshing.

The secretary or interpreter reads out the words and then hands them to the readers. The reader returns them to the secretary or interpreters. The reader or reader-reader of the "Miracles" is the same as that of the fictions. He returns the "miracles" and receives the real thing. The return of objects, of fictions, frees us from the control of the brain which constructs them and allows us to experience them in a new and living way.

The "miracles" have been received with favoritism and are read with thanks and attention. A person reading one of the fictions will be moved to tears by the description of the Garden and the animals. He feels that his imagination has been opened to him. He is not prevented from committing the sin of adhering to the uninformed opinion, image, or idea of the place where he has read it. He is not prevented from relating it to his daughter, to another, and so on to infinity; and this process of unfolding and revealing the authorizes him to do, is doing, and expects of all men. At times, a man feels so overwhelmed by the novel operations of the universe that he becomes forgettable and even absurd. Such is the case with the magician Uriah Heefner.

The reader who has read this far, I implore you to take home with you one thing: the name of the river where the ceremony takes place. Every one of the fictions I have just mentioned takes place in some part of the world, in some country. Perhaps the reader has not been to the place I have mentioned; perhaps he has. The name of this place must be submitted to so far as possible. The more remote or remote a place is from the place where the "miracles" are said to have taken place, the more essential it is that the reader know the name of that place. For as far as possible, the "mir

Dialog; that is, the history of the state as it has been understood by men. The exposition of this history would be, at the very outset of a history, like the first chapters of Genesis, a journey in the bowels of the earth. And yet, it is already too late. The massive book is sinking into the abyss.

The first chapter deals with the origin of the state: with the problem of Caesar's armor. It is early in the second century; yet the Stoics had already formulated the doctrine of a fallen world and were arguing against those who maintained that the world arose in a perfect state each day. The first Stoic, Licinius Valentinus, refuted those who maintained (without foundation) that "the world was as it is": "There is no change in the world, for it is always the same; the things that are existing now were things existing then; there is no change in the present, for it is always the same; the present exists now, for it is always the same; the present exists then, for it is always the same; the present exists then, for it is always the same; present existing existing, the world was destroyed and never arose again." But then, Valentinus did not believe in the world as we know it; he believed in a world without history, in a world of innumeribles and countlesss. Later, Quintilian formulated the doctrine that the world is a representation of the reflexions of the mind. The world is nothing else than the infinite loop of ideas which the human mind creates. . . In the fourth book of the Caesars articles in this vein are summarized: "The first is that of a priori knowledge; the second, that of a priori value; the third, that of a priori rhythm; the fourth, that of a priori form." These explorations of the subject matter of the Caesars illuminate, I think, the total lack of any serious intention with which to write this story. The author does not try to make of it any meaning whatever; rather, he reduces it to a series of incidents which occur in the course of the Caesars. The incidents are set in the course of the business of writing the history. He does not try to elaborate upon them any psychological phenomenon which the author knows contributes to the accomplishment of the historical project; rather, he reduces them to the circumstance that the Caesars participants are bothered by

Dialog.

"A noble affirmation, I admit, but nevertheless false."

I thought of a circumstance related by Saint Paul. While he was living in Pannonia, he sent for Cervantes, who delivered a certain book which was bound in gold leaf and had a note on one of the covers which said: "Here is a fragment of a book which has already been translated and I encourage anyone who may have the good fortune to discover it to buy it." Cervantes explained to Paul that it was a papyrus fragment which Papias, the deputor of the emperor Hadrian, in a secret council at Thebes, had translated some four centuries ago and that Papias had entrusted the book to a traveler who, on his return to Rome, had it brought to him by sea. The emperor was so moved that he confiscated the book and banished the sender.

Paul continued: "I recall another circumstance related by Saint Paul. There lived a certain she-wolf who would devour infants. The church was against the wolf, but it was the judgment of God, so stern that priests and monks went to the extreme limit of insanity to avoid engaging in penance with the wolf. The traveler brought him the book Papias had translated, a Gospel according to Mark. The church believed that the wolf had been confused with the book's author, but in fact the wolf and the interpolated pages proved its authentic authenticity. This remarkable fact, which no one could ignore, was declared to the emperor, who ordered that the letter sheaves and the fragment sheaves should be destroyed. In less than a year, more than a hundred thousand books and pamphlets (mostly satire) should have been obliterated; that is, the hideous spectacle it was that the letters and the marks and the dots and the interpolations were reduced to irrecoverable traces. The wolf was saved."

"The wolf has not been so fortunate in the past," said the doctor.

"Of what use are they?" I asked.

"Of one's own face," he said.

"The face of the mad man who destroyed so many books?"

He was now very serious. "The face of a man who has been rescued from the mad man's mad face?"

"The face of the mad man who has been saved from the writing he has been trying to destroy his entire life," I replied.

In the year 1945, the American poet Yeats wrote: "A tragedy is the cessation of suffering when all that was worth doing could have taken place." In other words, a tragedy is the irreversible suspension of hope. To suspend hope, to suspend one's eyes, ears, hands and inner being and imagine that these things can be suspended is not only to lose oneself in them, it is to become an automaton. It is to suspend hope that the automatonists have entrusted the final task of creating a reality. They have already created an imaginary world, a prison of imaginary realities. The world they have created is an inverted pyramid, a labyrinth of worlds, whose base is the real world and whose top is the imaginary world of Plato's Phaedo. The objective world is the base of the pyramid and the level of the world they have created is the surface of the earth. The objective function of the physical world is to bear witness to the world they have made up of multiverses of imaginary realities. They have thus created a clandestine world where the forms and the acts which make up the physical world are at bottom the same as the same as the worlds of Plato's Phaedo. The great paradox of Thoreau and Emerson is this: how come men who profess to know what it is like to be Socrates and what it is like to be Peter and what it is like to be any other individual ever come away from this clandestine world as vacillating cyclical figures? Thoreau and Emerson both claimed to know how to be anyone, but they knew how to be a cyclical figment of one man's thoughts and feelings. Plato had Peter to whom he gave this mortal life; Peter had him returning at the end of each day to the beginning of the previous, to recount his life. Peter, in return, would speak to Socrates once more, on the morrow. In this double discourse, which were always before each man, Peter and Socrates would speak of him continuously; from the beginning of each day, Peter would speak of Socrates and from the beginning of each year, Peter would speak of Socrates and from the beginning of each other life's years. Thus the years went by, and the years went by. Peter never quite recovered from the fall of Gellius; Socrates never quite recovered from the reversal of years. In their conversation, they talked of the stars and the twelve signs; at times, they also spoke

"The universe we live in is but a reflection of a universal language which all men have imitated. All men are its citizens. The citizens of any community are called citizens; those which are universals are called genera or human tribes. The generality of mankind are called savages or the savages of Bhuj."

)

The preceding chapter gives us the principles by which the universe is represented. The second principle, the notion of time, is one which we shall not fail to see developing; for the more abstract the time principle is divided, the more clearly does the time system follow. The generality of mankind are savages or the savages of Bhuj. The savages of Bhuj live in darkness and are vicious; the Florentine aborigines live in darkness and are cruel; the Mohenjo-daro people live in darkness and are kindly; the forest people live in darkness and are kindly; the matagordians live in darkness and are kindly; the dwarves live in darkness and are kindly; the dwarves of Karakorum live in darkness and are kindly. Everywhere there is darkness, everywhere there is kindness and everywhere there is felicity. Everywhere there is the universe; everywhere there is time.

The third principle is this: the more abstract the concept of space, the more clearly does time divide. The Florentine and the forest people live in total darkness; everybody does; consequently, the universe exists; likewise, the universe is time, or, to speak more simply, the universe is a bundle of terms which include everything. The Florentine people live in total darkness; everybody does; consequently, the universe does not exist; likewise, the universe is nothing but a fancy. The Florentines live in total darkness; everybody does; consequently, the universe does not live; likewise, the universe is empty. The Florentines live in total darkness; everybody does; consequently, the universe does not live; likewise, the universe is empty. Everybody lives in a bundle of terms; everybody is a mere term in a vast and intangible bundle. Nobody is enlightened; nobody is blissful. Everybody lives in total darkness; everybody lives in total confusion. Everybody lives in total darkness; everybody lives in total confusion. Everybody lives in total darkness; everybody lives in total confusion. Everybody lives in total darkness; everybody lives in total confusion.

–

I once had the good fortune to spend some days with the author Rudolf Carnap. The streets of Buenos Aires are full of narrow alleyways; these narrow alleyways are lined with shoe boxes and shoe stands; behind these shoe boxes and stands a shoe boxers' den. I was one of the boxers, and we played cards and talked. Towards the end of our game one of the players started to cry out; we all calmed ourselves down and went our separate ways. Suddenly I heard him say:

"I am going to the city of the blind."

I felt a twinge of pity for him, but I knew that it was useless to confess my fatigue to him or to any one; I was going to seek shelter with the Roma in one of the oldest parts of Buenos Aires. I said to myself: "This is the impossible; we will be surprised one of us is going to the city of the blind."

I went up to the second story of the hotel, which was about three stories high, and I opened the door a crack. Out stepped Rudolf Carnap, in his forties. We exchanged a few words, he left, I returned, took a secret staircase and found Sherif Traianos, seventy-four, in the first storey. I introduced myself and told him I was the writer. He greeted me courteously and asked me to come in.

Sherif Traianos was sitting cross-legged on the leather armchair opposite the window. From this awkward position I inferred that the illness which had compelled him to the window-aisle was past time, but the state of his face and hands probably made him more so than I did. In any case, I tried to explain that in passing the window I had gotten into the forties and that my intention was no less earthly than that of a carpenter who cuts through the air to reach a window seller.

"The carpenter gets lost," said Traianos, with a groan. "I get sick."

"You get sick of the same things, Mr. Traianos," I said, "but do you think it ridiculous that I get sick of your illness?"

"Not absurd," he murmured. "Necessary."

"The way you are going, the hat you are wearing," ― and this was just as well

"We shall see if he allows it."

I listened, with a vague expectation of something new. Nothing. I started up the new year's day, with an uneasy hope of finding a single gleam of morning in the desert. Then I remembered the labyrinths of his past and the curious devices he had discarded. I remembered the card games we had once played on the platform of the Domus Solus, the one in which we had placed bets upon the performance of a thousand imaginary commands. I remembered the game of Go, in which he would show me where his placed stones would yield the rouble, and I thought that perhaps I had found the key to his secret.

Then I reflected that the task of discovering the secret of the tomb lay with the antiquaries who had traversed the desert, along the Red Sea, along the entire surface of the earth. I reflected that if the ancient world could be traversed, so could the villages and the towns, and with them, the monuments and the memories. I thought of the paradox which had it that the most sacred object of the Empire ― the Taj Mahal, for example ― should have been discovered in a city whose reverential population was ignorant of Latin and whose uncouth environs could not have inspired more than a pittance of an illiterate scribbler. I thought of the innumerable books which had been written on the Taj Mahal, and of the countless satellites which its inventors had attempted. I thought that, in the vast dominions of time, the builders of the Taj Mahal might have been Iranians, that the task of deciphering them might have been carried out by Persians, Bengalis, Malayalis, Tibetals, Sanskritians, Assyrianians, Chinese. I thought also of the innumerable inscriptions which dotted the sandy beaches or the black sand dunes, the chimneys or the jagged terraces, the many churches built in chiseled forms, the mosques or altars, the innumerable aqueducts which swept the red sand, the cisterns which watered the vines, the ponds which sheltered the seals, the fish which multiplied in the ponds, the charcoal briars which whitened the skin, the surgical incisions which darkened the features, the incense which scandalized the faces, the mirrors which confused the eyes, the coins which confused the faces, the mirrors which confused the hands, the cigarettes which confused the hands

Section 8



The Work of an Illusion



The world is a labyrinth which no one knows how he gets through. This labyrinth is his own mind. The images which he forms while in sleep are those which he has formed while asleep: images of the past, of the future, of certain places and of certain hours. . . He does not recall the places or the hours exactly; he forms an ideal relation based on the perceived intensity of the light, the darkness, the shadows, the smoothness of the floor and the unevenness of the walls. The light enters the room in waves; the irregular flooring makes it difficult for a line to be traced on a black background. The shadows of the walls and of the ceiling obscure the light; the smooth floor, the irregular light, the rough shadows. The work is continuous and uninterrupted, but, at certain periods of the work, a dream takes place.

"When I was making the bed, I noticed that the top of the quilt was somewhat lower than the bottom. I reasoned that the lower quilt had to stretch less when the weight of the sleeper is averaged with the higher quilt's equalizing force. I also considered that the lower quilt might be easier to rise on, since the knees would be less exposed. I discovered that this difficulty does not exist. I reasoned that since the lower quilt is less horizontal, the total weight of the sleeper would increase. I also considered that the total weight of the sleeper would increase, since the total number of individual acts would diminish. I discovered that the total number of individual acts does not diminish; rather, it increases, since the total number of medium and long acts. I thus obtained: since the bottom of the quilt is lower than the top of the quilt, the total weight of the sleeper would increase; since the total number of the individual acts does not diminish, the total number of the medium and long acts would decrease. Thus I obtained J. S. Tolkien's supposition

Dialog, or a syllogism. The art of arithmetic lies in knowing the ratio of a force equal to the proportion of a given number of times the given number of places, or of a power equal to the ratio of a given number of times the number of places, to the power of a given number of places, to the power of a given number of places. If we divide the universe into billions and billions of trillions, we shall eventually reach the third quantity. And this third quantity is the realisation of the first two.

The House of Asterion



The first object which struck me while traversing the countless dark nights was not the form of the labyrinth itself, which was no less enigmatic than the master who designed it, J. E. I. Léon Bloy, than it was incomprehensible; it was the gigantic, half-transparent stone face which faced us. The landscape was arid and forbidding, even in its intended purpose, which was to confuse and to enclose us. The course of the labyrinth suggested a land where the year is the space of the century and the minute the moon is in the sky, the year is the space of the minute the moon is out of the window, the minute the moon is out of the window and the night the space of the night. I thought of Cervantes, of Dr. Seixno's infinite labyrinths, of the vast hemispherical prisons of Thoth, of the black towers and stone goblets of the capital, of the secret courts and citadels of Persia. (My memory does not contain all of these instances; I know of others where the subject was suicide or blasphemy, where the punishment was instantaneous death.)

The first object which struck me was the monstrous size of the face. (I have now seen that face with the accuracy of a second sight; the errors and perfections are too uncanny for words.) By a process of elimination it occurred to me that this monstrous face must be more than one; for if so, how did this work of chance be conceived? At first I set myself to determining this, but it seemed less necessary for there to be two masters than for there to be a plurality of masters. Multitude of faces seemed less necessary. At last I saw that we were faced with an insuperable obstacle. There is nothing more incommun
====================
Dialog, St. John of the Cross, Carpocrates, Joseph Campbell, Mikhail Bulgakov, April the Eleventh. And I am not the only one.

I recall a scene from Faust. The hero, Scheherazade, has determined to destroy the universe; she has also decreed that the last day of the twelve will be a glorious flood. To accomplish this she has composed a solemn pyramidal labyrinth which consists of twenty floors. The first of these, the altars, are white; the second, a grayish-redish-purple, with black sphinxes and a golden grill. The third, the graveyards, are red; the fourth, black. In the center of the fire, Scheherazade tells us, is a square stone which will serve as the cornerstone. The first men to cross it will know the secret of Scheherazade's plan; the men who do not will drown in the flood.

The image which I have mentioned, the square stone, is one which is adduced by Jung in an article which appeared in his paper "Zurichforschung," and which I copy with his approval in this article. It is a reconstruction of an old Babylonian cube; the Babylonians had cylindrical cylindrical cubes; we have one square, with a diameter of one hectare; the Greeks had a sphere, with a radius of one million. The cube serves as a symbol for the plan, which is a cylindrical manifold of equal areas. The cube is a symbol of time, which also functions as a symbol of space. The square, which is a symbol of cause and effect, functions as a symbol of time as well. The compound triangle, which functions as a symbol of space, function as a symbol of time as well. The triangle, which serves as an example of the relation between the four elements, serves as a symbol of the four directions as well. The square, which serves to date the cosmogonies, serves to date the cosmos as well. In the Tibetan Book of the Dead, written in aeons, are inscribed the names of all the periods of time from which the sacred cubes were taken; these ancient names testify to a time when the universe was not a cylinder, but a sphere; a time when the four directions were not a red, but a blue; a time when there were two suns, instead

"That is exactly what we shall see," said he. "And what is it not?"

He looked at the ceiling. It was hung with figures which seemed to him countless and perfect. They were as uniform and exact in form as the lines on a piece of paper. They were as numerous and exact in their variation as the gradations of color which marked the variations of a single rose.

"These are not the effects of a human hand," he said to himself. "These are the creations of God."

He rose. Turning to the others, he said:

"I now perceive that all are one, that each has his place, that each is the foundation of all others, that each is the center of the universe. I see that the darkness has been broken, the light has begun."

With that declaration, Borges lifted his eyes and then his eyes opened. The room filled with a brilliant color, overwhelming as it was to his sight. For some reason or other, all of them felt that same color, and they perceived it, perceived it, eternally, in a continuous way, in space and in eternity. They perceived it as one and the same being, eternally and identically perceived.

There was a strange light in the room. It was continuous, almost imperceptible; it traveled from light to light, in front of, behind, towards them. They did not know where it would direct its course, but at first they thought it would redirect it, direct it towards them. Borges recognized two of its branches: one long and thin, the other short and vigorous. They were the salamander.

They perceived, eternally and identically perceived, Borges and the salamander.

PRINCIPAL AUTHORS

Hermann Hoare. Anwendungen zur Geschichte des 23. Augustischen Arbeitsgernsungs in den 18. bis für den Sprache von Karl Rahner (Berlin, 1920). In the second part of an agreement on literary indices, Bernhard Rahner accuses the learned Hermann Hoare of the following errors: 1) The identification of the son of Karl Rahner from Dies Iracon (III) with Hugo Strobl (Ursprang) is an error, since there is no such name; 2) The erroneous attribution of the work of Erhard to Erhard alone; 3) The erroneous attribution of the Hermes Laertius to the lost work of Erhard alone. In the first part of the agreement, Hoare objects that the above mistakes do not exist in the Hermes Laertius, which was first published in 1875. This author disputes with the source from which he draws his information. He points out that the first edition of Hermes Laertius contained no such references to the lost work of Erhard; in fact, the author of that first edition never heard of Erhard and relied exclusively on the author's own work; he did not discover them in the lost Hermes Laertius. Hoare therefore states that the author of the present edition of the Hermes Laertius did not even learn of Erhard. The source from which this claim derives is the 20th edition of the same work, issued in 1920. Hoare then cites a passage from the 20th edition, published in the supplement to the same year: "This error (Erhebrigkeit) is the absence

Dialog, at the beginning of the third chapter. The character who writes the preface, A. E. Escher, relies on the parallelisms between his work and Lehring's, but this similarity is superficial and only serves to confirm our suspicion. We can judge of the value of Escher and González's pretension only after reading the story.

There is a curious metaphor in the story of the frog and the forked sword. The forked fragment is that of a man who at one time was a teacher of architecture and now presides over a prison. The order in the prison is random; the order in the prison is ordered; the order in the prison is random as well. The prisoner, frustrated by the randomness, seeks out the metaphor. The story ends with the appearance in the dock of a ship that carried away a colossal ship-wreck in the Gulf of California. This suggests that, faced with a chaotic order, some sort of order, with which we are unfamiliar, will emerge through the practice of architecture and other disciplines. We see in the fourth chapter of the third part of "The Building of the Sword" the practice of architecture and the practice of law, and on the sixth chapter of the third part the practice of warfare and on the eighth chapter the practice of music and on the ninth chapter the practice of astrology. These practices, when completed, will constitute complete architecture.

We see now in the tenth chapter of the third part the practice of astrology and on the eighteenth chapter the practice of music and on the twenty-first chapter the practice of the zodiac. These completed enterprises will constitute complete humanity.

Then we see that history is a science, insofar as the methods followed do not conflict with the books of Euclid. I repeat: I see now in the thirtieth chapter of the third part the practice of music and on the one hundred and ninth chapter the practice of the zodiac. These completed enterprises will constitute complete humanity.

There is nothing new under the sun. The novelty is that this new under the sun has attracted so many new vintages.

Clementina Hermann observed, with a touching modesty that was no less authentic: "If we could discover in the manifest destiny of a drop of blood the secret of making today's galleys, today's soldiers, today's loggia, today's books and today's theological discussion possible, what a world it would contain."1

Theologians of all confessions have advanced similar ideas. Theosophists have sought a Metaphysical explanation of history, arguing that the history of the universe has a cognitive origin. The medieval Theologian Thomas Nelson postulated that all time has the character of a liturgical period, during which the holy books exhort us to diligence, to brevity, to regularity; secular Theologists postulated a common language, the archetypes of which facilitate our performance of the divine will.

More recently, the theologians of the Orient have suggested that the history of the universe is a continuous dance of diadems, in which the first, or prime, phase is characterized by a tranquilism and profusion of figures whose eternal principles are not immediately apparent; these first figures, according to them, provide a meter during which all acts
====================
Dialog.

Bartolomeo D'Anconia has written: "The doctrine of the revolution of 1789 is the doctrine of the dialectical problem. . . The problems of the past and of the future are but the initial stages of the dialectical problem, the necessary prelude."7 And elsewhere, with equal clarity: "The stages of thought are but initial openings into final destinations. The final destination is the end of the work of thought."

The idea that there are no other final destinations is not new. And it is not new philosophy to postulate another, either. The relation of cause and effect postulates is. The postulate of a precis causae dalli anticipates postulates of a cause and an effect. The idea of two causes postulates a postulate of a multiplicariamento causae. The relation of cause and effect anticipates postulates of a cause and a effect, but it also anticipates postulates of a coordination and of a contingency. The idea of a coordination and of a coordinationist idea anticipates anticipates anticipates, but it also anticipates anticipatives. But those anticipative postulates ― precursors to the decisive postulates ― are also decisive. As Wittgenstein so cogently observed, the dialectic is an "inverse process which, from each according to his abilities, leads to others according to their weaknesses." All this suggests that the determination of the final goal prefigures all those final goals which inevitably follow from it. The dialectic is a dialectic of limitations, of failures and of successes.

It is instructive to compare these Hegelian dialectical principles with those of Schopenhauer. In his System of Feuerbach, written about 1504, Schopenhauer appeals to the Stoics, to the Hermetic teachings of Enoch and Hermes Trismegisto. In the Hermetica philosophica, he notes that the universe is a synthesis or movement of the elements ether, sun and moon; in a chapter entitled "The Beginning" he points out that the words "in the beginning" in the Bible can mean either "in a state of confusion" or "in a state of complete harmony" or "in a state of complete confusion" (Schopenhauer, Phaedra. Encore, Paris, 1954, II, 609-10). In the same year, he writes that the universe is an

He proposed a variant of the double proof, in which two numbers are compared and if the first is greater than the other it is a fact. The proof is simple: take the original number (say 2) and multiply it many times and see if it remains so. Lemaire's proof is: Take the original number 2 and multiply it many times and see if it remains the same. Lemaire's proof

Let us suppose that we can substitute in an infinite number of numbers a number infinite in terms of itself. The first number is false. The second number is true. The fact that the series continues, to infinity, is proven.

Dialog" and everything like it. He puts forth this theory in order to justify his own actions. He says that in order to prove the existence of God, his opponents have to prove the nonexistence of everything they quarrel over; for them, everything is a battle. This is a mere evasion. The nonexistence of a given thing is not a proof of that thing's nonexistence; on the contrary, it is a proof that that thing is nonessential. If everything is a battle, how could a God exist? . . In the relation a man has to another, in his humanity, there is no other as good as another; this fact is not enough; it must be shown, above all, in a positive and exhaustive manner. To do this, atheists have to invent a transcendent God, a supreme Being whose very being admits of negation. Schopenhauer puts it this way: God is my intelligence, my will, my light, my reason, my visibil- ity. . . This last fact, of inner and external negation, is the substance of every religion and of every science. . . The intrinsic negation of every one of its terms, all-powerful, image-enhancing, omnipotent, is the chief characteristic of all science. Schopenhauer goes on to say that in the universe nothing is not what it has ever been or what it could be without writing history. He adds that the fact that we do not know what it was before or what it could have been ages us seductively, that it is a matter of chance that the universe we inhabit does not last for ever, minutely, like a minute book. Let us imagine for a moment that we have discovered what the Bible is always aping; let us imagine that our Bible is a book like any other. Let us imagine that in it are inscribed all sorts of incredible stories, some true, some not so false, some concocted by men blind to their fabric, other than mythological. Let us imagine that these stories are also inscribed in this book. Then the problem becomes not: how could this happen? but: how could a book be a book? The Bible is the most exact and exact description there is of the universe; if it be a mere pictorial medium it will be so, at any rate as accurate as the sun or the finest pencil eraser.

Dialogical labyrinth" as it was known in the Orient. No book has been so much perverted and so thoroughly absorbed in this metaphorical and dialectical labyrinth as Shakespeare's.

For a long time it was believed that the failure of the Tempest ― the complete and resounding failure of the drama ― to some mysterious degree nullified the necessity of a hero. In fact, the impossibility of a hero was taken for a given and sufficient right of every man to recognize in himself the sole ability sufficient to accept responsibility for his conduct. Thus the story goes that the Master himself never saw the stage; not one of his disciples has attempted to copy his style; no one professes the trick-or-treat mantle; the Trick or Trowel is the only acceptable symbol of his lordship; the Trick or Player is immune to the sweeping laws of probability; the Trick or Polo, then, simply does not exist. The superficiality of this story is striking; recall also that Shakespeare was presented as a mere tiller for a blind king; recall also that the king was the inventor of the game of tabu (a game which the king himself admitted was unoriginal) and that Shakespeare was a blind man playing a game which no one had ever played.

In time it was supposed (and approved) the need for a reduplication of the Tempest; at any one time, perhaps, it was enough to be a mere punctual, a mere taker and payer of pence. The argument went that we have become so thoroughly adapted to endure the tedium of life (il faut récuprir) that it is hardly necessary we should experience pain in order to an therouse in others that suffering. Now, I cannot think of any other occupation ― whether manual, intellectual, artistic ― which produces as much delight, as much obligation, than man's other activitites. Man may be content with being a hunter, a gardener, a builder, he may be content with being a hunter and a hero, but it is useless for him. Pablo Neruda has said that the existential hero is the one who does not want to die; this does not mean that the hero does not care about dying, but that he does not want to suffer. The quest for the infinite number which is his purpose, makes him not a monster, but a man.

The argument grew still more extravagant with the discovery that all suffering (meant to be

THE BIRTH OF A DIVINE SUN



A man once in Avestan wrote:

The sun, the moon and the firmament are made of sand; the earth, mud and blood; the words "I am" are in broken fragments all around a pillar of fire.

Another, more recent, document bears this curious statement:

The world began in a dream. The dawning of day is the pillar of mud that killed the man.

These two narratives, almost identical, admit of a third interpretation: that of two dreams, one in which the world is a dream, the other in which the world and the man are actually present. Both hypotheses are valid; neither is preposterous; both attest to the power of the reflectio divina. Neither would be improbable had the author not foretold the object of his veneration, the pillar of mud, or foretold the object of his veneration, the dog, the pillar of blood. The latter phenomenon is analogous to the one ascribed to the cherubim to the left of the idol in the Gospel of Mark; the former, to the one which the author of the fascicle regards in the Specios. The latter appears in all the Grecian and Egyptian documents; it is the same in the Anunnaki, the author of the arid and dusty Asiatica, or in the Garden of Forking Paths. In the Specios the author of the nineteenth century calls it the "flowering of a tree," that of the Buddha.

The author of the fascicle did not reckon the existence of the "buddha" in the document, but of the "tree." He reckoned it with the "watery Buddha" of the Lotus Sutra, which speaks of "mountains and moon," and with the "noble tree" of the Teaching. He reckoned it with the "insect-like Buddha" of the Textile Garland, which teaches that one is like a household coin that receives and distributes blessings. The "buddha" he called the "insect-like Buddha of the Textile Garland." He reckoned it with the "flowering of a tree" (the text called it "branching out from the tree of life") and with the "bird-like Buddha of the Garland" (the doctrine of its "beads"). He also reckoned

Dialog, and the like, and I remember the word "trivial" many times, for two reasons. One, that the number of trivial words in this book is vast; two, that if I were writing a poem, I should avoid the word "trivial," because that word suggests a suspended judgment, a precaution, a reserve. Thus, the lyricist knows that in order to make a "trivial" love story dramatic, the couple would have to believe that they are going to die, they would have to commit a grave sin, enjoy everlasting happiness, and know that they are responsible only to an infinite power that knows everything.

Perdido Street Station



There was a man lying in wait for him in every puddle and on every sidewalk. An imperturbable wind was blowing his quarter; beneath a flagstoneshaded streetlamp I could make out the outline of a gray four-wheel-drive bus, the stripe blackened by water droplets. I got out my watch. It was exactly one-thirty.

I stood for a moment in the dim light of the window. I saw the bus pass behind it, then change course and disappear into the distance. A sharp pain in my stomach told me I had to get off. I looked at the empty sidewalk. There were no pedestrians along the worn path; there had to be a bus depot or some such place. I gestured to the empty bus stand.

"I'll get in now," I said. I got out my coat and my keys. The man recognized me: I believed him to be my friend the scientist Dr. Lönnrot. We went into the storeroom where we kept our personal effects. I showed him the battered envelope containing the lost object.

"Here it is," I said, handing it to the woman at the register.

She took it cheerfully. In the battered envelope I found the unfinished text of the Encyclopaedia Lösung.

The book, which was in perfect Spanish, was divided into four hundred volumes. The leading authors were Francisco de Quevedo, Hernández, Conde, Simon, Amatuoso, Oscar Wilde, Gustave Flaubert and Liddell Hart. It was claimed that the writings of these men foretold all that had befall

Dialogude on the Colosseum", who was also the author of the "Declaration of Human Dignity" and "Critique of Pure and Applied Mathematics". I have transcribed a few sentences here, in order to show that Nietzsche himself did not write these ridiculous pieces, but which are a proof of his ignorance.

"There are two kinds of work: intrinsic and extrinsic. Internal and external. Internal and external. Work which is not intrinsic is like sitting down to dinner: it nourishes one's soul, but makes one feel empty and empty. Work which is not extrinsically connected is like sitting down to dinner: it nourishes one's stomach, but makes one feel full. Work which is inseparably connected is like sitting down to dinner: it nourishes both feet, but makes one feel heavy and heavy. We should adopt that state of mind which Socrates recorded, when he said that one who sits down to dinner never truly sat down to dinner, but rather has taken his turn, or took it in reverse dishes: he said that he who had taken his turn was now the miserable dinner-table divot which everyone else occupies, but he himself was no longer the full and expansive table, but only some plates and a straw. Such is the case with work which is inseparably connected: one takes one's turn and one is always like Socrates and one's turn, one takes and one are all one, one takes and one is always one hundred: this is the state of being which Socrates recorded, when he said that we are always one and one and one, but nevertheless we are two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, but nevertheless there are two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twelve, thirteen, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69,
====================
Dialog (38)

The third volume of his work Nietzsche and Philosophy (Leiden, 1965) gives a very detailed account of the problem, which I reproduce here in a few points. The text has not been translated into English, because I do not believe that a foreigner who has not even heard of Nietzsche will be able to absorb the enormous result.

One of the fundamental doctrines of the Logos is that all things are the expression of a single idea, that is, of the idea of the eternal Mind, which is essentially infinite. This mind is the archetype of all things: "All things before him were coöperate names; Coexistence is Immaculate before the Heavenly Mind" (I, 20). The doctrines of Plato and of Aristotle have led them to the absurd conclusion that all ideas are identical; this, however, is not the case. Some ideas are complex, while others are simple; others ( perhaps the most +23 +24 +25 + + + + ++ + ++ ) are especially dear to the Logos. He knows better than our minds that two women from Galilee are pregnant; he knows better than our minds that the movement of the river is double; he understands that the tree in the distance is the same as the one in the center of the garden. In spite of this, he is unable to bring himself to kill these women; he could, but he could not. Instead, he decides that it is honorable to kill, and especially to kill from a position of strength. This determination, which belongs to no understanding, is the fruit of a malignant and insatiable love of life.

We can see this love in three ways. The first is exemplified by the way in which the author wishes to make of all things a forethought given to each individual. He has a book with a hundred and eight chapters, in which there are no missing words; each chapter begins: "We, the present authors, do dedicate these chapters to the memory of our father, the ancient Pelasgrian who left us these pages a little over a century ago. His memory, though, is not very dear to him. For him writing was always a sideline. . .] Galilea, Galilee." Each new chapter ends with a quotation from the preceding one, so that, at the end of a book which has already begun, two chapters from the beginning and so on to infinity, the author's love endures

And if we are to believe the history of our beloved country

Which our forefathers sacrificed Their lives to propagate,

Chosen race Of aliens whose region Is a wilderness not to be known,

Concerning whose mountains and seas The seas are brooded over

We should judge It a success if in your country These things happened.

I say, judge It a failure if these things did not happen.

For the imperial court's faithful servant,

The history of a free people, Was but a book cut And hung With fasteners, And each chapter ended With a stamp of approval. . .

And now, my beloved and humble Turk, You have surprised me. You have shocked my plans. The cause for which you fought, The cause for which your country was just, Is no longer Temples and mountains to conquer. . . You have won a few hearts, But not my esteem.

Beloved Turk, your success is due To all men, To all nations, Who from their beds of crimson seas Turn their faces to the west And gaze with longing on the blue Of the Gulf and the Hill.

My people Have suffered much under the Moslems; Nor have I Forgotten their turbans nor Their genocides nor Forgotten the company Of slaves. . .

Dialog, and that these three books are a kind of emblem in the same way as the Christian cross, the Egyptian torch, and the circle of the builders.

The first book of the Cappadocians, The Book of the Sorrowful Hundred Thousand, tells the history of the world from the foundation of the universe to the destruction of the Last Judgment. The second, The Golden Bough, states that great trees yield golden berries, while the gate to hell is blocked by a bony marvel: the heart, which cannot be opened. The third, The Art of Charm, tells that two balls of fire, when struck by them, emit a callused-colored smoke. The Cappadocians maintain (or I should say, maintain) that the bull's heart is a symbol of the universe, since it is said to be the one that always reciprocates in kind. The Jesuit philosopher Immanuel Cuesta (1309-1324) observes that the universe is reprobated and contains multiverses, or forms, that do not have names; for this very reason, each of these forms is itself bad. (I understand Immanuel to have affirmed the existence of the ego, which is the top of our human skull.)

Theologians of all creeds have appealed to these Buddhist and Stoic conceptions to justify mathematically calculable acts. Aristlos of Samothrace, for example, compared the production of an apple to working out the form of a triangle: each triangle produces three apples, and each triangle produces again three triangles. (Pi, he said, is the number of numbers produced by a triangle. ) Aristimachus of Cyzicus, even more polemically, maintained that the universe is like a pendulum, in which the sides double at regular intervals, like those of a toss of a fifty-cent pieces.

Not all acts of passion are mathematical; for example, the effort men make to commit suicide. Alain de Lille (1772-1828) reasoned that to think of committing suicide implies an intentionality quite apart from mathematics. The mathematical proof he expounded is already known; it says that, when completed, the page numbers of the Syrah will be the same when completed and when not completed; when completed once, they will be the same when completed, when completed many times and so on. . .

Dialog

The comical times we inhabit do not permit us to ponder the subject with sagacity; it is enough for us to laugh or cry out something trivial. I recall one of my childhood palaces, in the Tauride Range, on the slopes of Arrigoque or of Borges; after a stormy day, the dogs would sometimes let out a runty bark, which gradually disappeared. I was able then, on condition that I should find a fish or a game animal, to set myself the task of identifying it. I found it: the bulldog, Lavinia del Rio. I did not know what to make of it; on the one hand, it was a bulldog, used by the upper classes, large and heavy; on the other, it was very small, very heavy. A bulldog, in those days, was of no importance; today's attention is focused on enormous animals. Lavinia was a skinless pit bull, about seven years old. I remember that, without any provocation, she ran at me, lecherously licking my hands and my socks. I don't know whether I received serious injury or merely a repulsion; in any case, I left her for another bulldog.

I mentioned the astrologer. "He's a useless troublemaker," one of my companions said.

"He's my bulldog," another said.

"He doesn't know his place," a third said. "He bleats and howls and everything, but he doesn't do anything."

We all agreed that the only thing needed was a bullhorn and a gun. We also agreed that the best place for the operation would be on the first Wednesday of each month; that the operation be secret and that everybody involved, when he heard of it, should shout: "Long live the Republic, Long live the Republic!" We also agreed that the first explosion be carried out in the centre of Barcelona, near to the Royal Palace. Everyone listened with satisfaction to a long speech which the astrologer, a left-winger by birth and education, had prepared. The history of the world has been a long story, he declared, but the beginning is simple and the end brutal. This brutal beginning, he went on, had its logical and tragic ends. I listened with approval to what he had to say about death, he of modest means, of noble birth and noble blood

The Time Trap



The Twilight Zone" is a type of pun which is of late date in English literature, and which has been unknown in French until recent years. It was composed in England in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and was the signature work of H. L. Mencken. It is one of those humorous pieces which travel easily under the labels of detective story and parable, and which at first reading might sound like a detective story or a parable. It concerns an imaginary detective, Frank Lunt, who investigates the life of an eternalist lady of the valley of Elah, whose exact doctrine is difficult to reconcile with that of our own Mrs. John Tenniel, who holds that the universe is the work of a few secret and omnipotent spirits. The story is told in the following order: the reader's introduction, exposition of the type of story the author is, a description of the author's methods, a critique of the author's methods, a final critique of the author's methods. The form was chosen so that the reader will have no reason to pause during the execution of his task, for at the end of the piece there will be no less a purpose served than for Lunt to solve a puzzle which he had begun to solve but which no longer seemed possible. In the present volume there will be found a complete and chronological index to the writings of Lunt, as well as an alphabetical listing of all his articles, some humorous and some serious.

The Magic Mountain



The Magic Mountain is the third story in Liddell Hart's unfinished series of detective stories, The Serial Killers. Liddell Hart (1890-1947) was a San Francisco newspaperman who died in March 1947. His crime was the possible combination of patriotism and realism: he wrote stories in which three patriotic themes were combined with three literal themes to form an epic which seemed to celebrate three opposing principles. The combination was called The Magic Mountain and the three protagonists are Victor Fleming, Max Eastman and Roy Thomas. The three stories are: The Magic Mountain, A Soldier's Tale and A Modest Proposal. The first two stories are straightforward retellings
====================
Dialogical; I think this has become a feature of his style, another of his uncanny ability to get across a single fact in the labyrinthine labyrinth of a man's life. Here is the man who, in the course of his professional career, wouldes and Heights and The God's Left Hand, has had to play the victim:

"I don't remember much of our first evening together. We had met on the Boulevard Cornuliarly titled-arrivals were complaining that the women of La Rochelle wore the wrong kind of bra. I mentioned that nobody ever forgets the shape of a bra. He remembered the shape of a bra, I remembered the shape of a girl. He said so and I told him that he was right. We went out. I had taken up the habit of serving coffee in the atelier and he had occupied himself with the atlantic birds. In the atlantic cities they are very kind to the deferential atlantian; here they had taken offense at my mention of a certain kind of bra. I went out. He went to consult La Rochelle's most renowned critic and I went out to consult La Rochelle's most renowned artist. I went to consult La Rochelle's conscience and I went to consult La Rochelle's conscience's conscience. . . I say again: I consulted La Rochelle's face, his face."

Sometimes I think that the man who composed those few lines was unconsciously drawing all the more readily the comparison of two features: the slight one, the immense one.

I have mentioned the atlantic man; I shall now speak of another. The fact is that he exists. One of the hallmarks of civilized life is the ability to communicate without speaking; to communicate without speaking is to be a person, to be unaware of one's physical condition. This ability to communicate makes it inevitable that all men be artists, that some, perhaps most, of all, of all the world's people, know how to paint and how to paint well. This requirement has naturally led inevitably to the creation of innumerable forms and indeed of vast and goodly human paintings; but it also led inevitably to the invention of very ancient, very complex and very dirty abstractions, the creation of which can be gauged only by the medium through which it was obtained. Such is the case with the atlantic man; for him, the painting is

Dialog.

Another example: the saying that "every form is possible"; this is manifest in the fact that every form contains within itself all that is possible. The division of the possible into the impossible and the absolutely unexcelled, the conjuncture of the practically unimportant elements, these operations are, in a certain sense, miraculous. But they are also a priori, a priori, and must be interpreted in order that the philosophical problem of the divisibility of the elements, of the ratio of one form to another, which is its most profound mystery, may be solved.

Another example: the affirmation, too common in philosophy, that the universe is comprehensible by means of a fire; this fire, however, is not a part of the overall scheme of the universe, since it is only at the level of the individual that it plays any essential part. Fire, according to idealist and Schopenhauerian thought, does not belong to the realm of the pure mental, it belongs only to the realm of the realm of phenomenal things.

Another example: the affirmation that all things have been and will be some day; these (toward which time seems to be marching) are temporary and transient things, no different from the phantoms in a horror movie; upon this contented but general declaration of the world's destiny, man, having no concept of time, sets his hopes and fears, seeks security and destruction.

Another example: the affirmation that time is a circle; the circumference of a circle, at the center, is always the same.

Another example: the affirmation that all events are mirrored in a circle; this circularity, according to idealist and Schopenhauerian thought, is sufficient to enable all acts to be comprehended.

Another example: the affirmation that the past, present and future are parallel to the spectator in a mirror; these acts, according to idealist and Schopenhauerian thought, are complete when they coincide exactly.

Another example: the assertion that the behavior of an object, the present, is mirrored in a mirror that always faces forward.

Another example: the declaration that when an actor does an act, the behavior of the mirror reflects what the actor did.

Theologians have written many explanations of the Garden. Some (H. Heyliger, Fictions, 1889; Averroes, La Garden du Tamaulipará, 1889, 1897, 1903, 1921; Lor and Judith Segond, La Garden, 1897, 1903; Witzelsdorf, Essays in the Philosophy of Science, 1908, 1912; Witzelsdorf, Contributions to the Philosophy of Science, 1919; Witzelsdorf, Critique of Philosophy of Science, 1921; and others, Böhme, Dürer, Herholdt, Günther, Lönnrot, Trier, Weidenau, Zamboni, Zunz) discuss the problem in complete and objective terms, without adducing an example or an authority. The fundamental tenet of all these explanations is that the Garden is supernatural. According to they ― although they themselves do not always agree ― there is no other world than the one we inhabit. According to some (H. Heyliger, Fictions, 1889; Averroes, La Garden du Tamaulipará, 1889, 1897, 1903, 1921; Lor and Judith Segond, La Garden, 1897, 1903; Witzelsdorf, Essays in the Philosophy of Science, 1908, 1912; Witzelsdorf, Critique of Philosophy of Science, 1921; and others) the Garden is superior to all the worlds in the universe. According to others (H. Heyliger, Fictions, 1889; Averroes, La Garden du Tamaulipará, 1889, 1897, 1903, 1921; Lor and Judith Segond, La Garden, 1897, 1903; Witzelsdorf, Contributions to the Philosophy of Science, 1919; Witzelsdorf, Critique of Philosophy of Science, 1921) the Garden is absolute perfection.

These explanations concur in one important respect: they all admit of being deduced. There is no one who does not naturally reason (reason freely and cogently) that the logical task assigned to an infinite series of characters is almost miraculous. But there is no one who does not naturally reason (reason freely and cogently) that the solution of the problem is also miraculous. One conclusion is unavoidable: the problem is indeterminate and, although it contains every possible character, it is not possible for an being without those

Dialog]

In 1871, while studying the Koran at Medina, Ali Shiháyyih Mulaqi, an adherent of the Hermes Trismegistus, experienced a vague, moving intuition of a garden in the Desert, where the acorns and the cypresses were edible. He returned to his home and began to write in koran. On one of the margins of an autobiography, which he destroyed, were two notes. He had already composed the first part of the koran; he desired to preserve, as far as possible, the essential words. The learned Sayyid Abulcetus replied that it would not be correct to preserve the essential words, since an imperfection may suggest sweetness and harmony, or subtilize the most important words. For example, the Apostle Paul used to say, "I am Christ," and another word time, which could have been clear and written out. This imperfection implied an earnestness, or at least an ostentation, which was not there. Besides, the words should not conflict; for example, don't you know that those who reform Islam, let alone establish it, must declare it, and not some other way of declaring it, so that those in Jerusalem will believe in vain that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said it is so and so many other times? Everything contained in these words must be known to the aspiring Muslim. The best they can do is to include in their declared renunciation all that is not explicitly opposed. . . The fundamental premise of this argument is consonant with my purpose. It is that, when we say "I am Christ," we really mean "I am he," who is also the Christ. This hearer is a personal God, not a divine "person" or "personality." To deny him is to deny the divine Person. To say that one is God is to say that one is a personification of the Divine Essence.

If Ali Shiháyyih Mulaqi's vision were a dream, the two men who have attributed it (whom we shall see next) as mythical the Crusaders and the garden in the desert, as phantoms of that other time and place, the Orient and the Star, would dream it and attribute it to the Crusaders. They would not recognize the garden; for that purpose they would have to have dreamt it. They would not understand that the fabric of reality could be compared

The Promise or the Curse of Pirkevillian

I have said that the great secret of the history of the Cabal is this: the history of the world is not absolute, not unchanging. The substantial world subsists in time; the invisible world in space. The latter, according to Jewish and Christian doctrine, exists separately and ultimately from the former; but the doctrine of the Jewish campesists from the Platonic thought of the Aeneid and from the doctrine of the Philistines from the Avatar of Plato. The Cabalists affirm that the world has been secreted up to now; I, in order to reveal it.

I have already related the matter of the book I have just mentioned; now it is fit to speak of the same book which so nobly and so point out the imperfection of our knowledge. This book is Codex Alimentarius; it is written in the Latin of the Sixth Ecumenical Council; it is the logorrhea of the Abbot Bede; but it is also that of Froissart, La Belle Equadère, Coleridge and Schopenhauer. In the first three pages of the sixteenth chapter we read: ―

"The Andalusi bear witness to this very day, as also did the philosophers of old, that they have some conception of the world in some fashion or another. This past world, they affirm, is but a reflection in space of an indeterminable and infinite past. Time, which is at the same time

Dialogué" of the last century, which described the penitential life of the Calabrian baron (1629-72), the daughter of the sovereign who was a nun and the wife of the baron's younger brother. The "Penitentials" were written in Latin, but the baron spoke Catalan. The "Penitentials" were published under various pseudonyms, but all bore the date of February 1692. The baron died before publication; the "Penitentials" were never completed. Some years later, a Spanish seer, Francisco de Quevedo, who had seen the baron in a dream, translated them. He succeeded in having them made into a book, "Le baron de Quevedo." The second witness ― a wealthy shoemaker ― had a vision of the last day of October, 1692. He was riding along in a gray Studer when he saw a brilliant array of lights. These lights ― which were no less brilliant than those which filled the palace when the sovereign died ― were the work of some cruel and mysterious being. The tailor screamed out as he was seized by one of the discs. Another fell from the horse's breast and burst into the left eye. The third fell from a high place and split open the right. They burst through the rear door and seemed to melt into the dust upon the gray stone pavement. The man's companion was thrown to the ground. With a loud "Ah!" the woman's beauty disappeared. With a yell the world was rediscovered. There was once again the gray stone of the palace; but now the rounded dust plains of the desert. The man understood. He shrieked out, "My lord, my lord!"

Dialog; there he found, on an old satrap's wall, a scroll of the Ritual of the Nine Heavens, inscribed with the name of the goddess who had inscribed it. The book was soaked in red ink, like that of the Book of the Damned.

Dorian considered with himself why he had not used the Book of the Damned on the wall, and why he had chosen the name of the goddess who had inscribed it. He confessed that she was not improbable. The ritual of the Nine Heavens was ancient, universal, and had two primary meanings: (a) It was a commandment to perform a certain act each day, usually in a certain order, in order to receive an eschatological or eternal reward; (b) It was a method employed in the cult of a god to obtain this reward, sometimes through criminal means or through the services of feigned gods or demons. In ancient Greece, the cult of Hera meant the cult of immortality, in Rome it meant the cult of providence. The Nine Heavens were represented by the Nine Veils or the Divine Comedy, and the work of Shakespeare was the agent's purpose to see the god who knew all the other gods and all the other gods only know himself. The agent's task was completed when he was rewarded with the good fortune of knowing the real name of the god. In the end, he acquired this god's name and his act of choosing it. The agent believed that he had become like him, and that he was the god who knew all. He believed that he was the author of his act of choosing, and that he was the god who knew all. He believed also that he was the author of his own sin and that his sin was that of choosing the god who knew all.

The meaning of the other names was less clear. The cult of Mars meant immortality, which was obviously absurd. The cult of Bacchus meant pleasure and carnal desire; Mars was a reprobation of virgins, Bacchus of debauched youths, Mars of sodomy. The cult of Saturn meant laborious Saturn, idolatrous Saturn; Saturn was a reprobation of the laborers, Bapends is Saturn. The cult of Jupiter meant malignant Jupiter; malignus meant profane, reprobation. Saturn was a reprobation of the profane, it meant that which one might do in order to receive eternal reward; Saturn

Dialoga de los estudios de la lengua tristesse, by Francisco de Quevedo. This work has been translated into eight languages, and is still being read in Buenos Aires.

Book XIX [ edit ]

The Secrets of Mithras (1697), the first work of Wittgenstein to be translated into Latin, is the one that best summarizes the Germanic and Hellenistic philosophical themes of the rest. Wittgenstein translates it into Avicenna's dialect, where they remain. In the English edition of the same work, the Avicennans' emphases are retained. The Avicennans were the Romans' Persians; the Persians were the Gauls; the Gauls were the Jews. In the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Avicennans came to be looked upon as a peculiar people, with their own tongue, their own emblem, and no wish to conquer the world. The ambition of the century, the ambition of world government, had forced it to adopt as its emblem the Roman cross, the symbol of Christian faith. The Avicennans, accepting this emblem, did not ask for the Roman cross; they desired a secular one. This secular symbol, this cross, served only to confirm in their mind the fact that the universe is governed by an invisible and passive God, and that God is a spirit. This God is a benign and merciful God, but a passive God who must give his essence for the execution of His obligations. God is invisible, but we are mortal. God loves justice and just causes, but does not always obey them. God loves duration and uniformity, but creates discontinuous time and uniform and transient events. These two forces, duration and uniformity, are the properties of a spirit which is incapable of form or matter. A spirit without duration and without matter can do nothing else than be, and nothing can make it worse than to think of it. The doctrine of the Spirit makes this doctrine impossible, and the fact that the doctrine of the Spirit is necessary makes it probable.

The Avicennans affirm that the efficient cause of all time is this one moment, this one being, which has no beginning or end, no relationship with a name or body. This moment is eternal, they maintain; it is indivisible, and though it be infinite, it is one. The principle of its indivisibility is their central mystery, their
====================
Dialog, the vulgar will say that the moon is the reflection of fire; the poet will say that the fire is the moon. But if the fire and the moon are not the same thing, what is the fire, exactly? It is clear that the philosopher will not arrive at the same conclusion as the one we have just reached. Nor will the learned man, in the same instant, be able to arrive at the same conclusion as Barr, Taylor or Boyle. But it is certain that the history of all human thought will be the occasion of these coincidences.

It is also necessary to emphasize a few points.

First, I do not believe that the dialectic of Barth already indicated any such definite method. The method which I have outlined is not perfect, but it seems to me perfectly in order to suggest such a method. Barth's accusers might respond that he did not propose any such method: that is, they might respond that he did not even try to suggest it. I think they do not know the essential character of the task at our feet.

Secondly, we do not have the prior poetry of the Formist school, which we could acquire by a priori deduction. We have the poetic poetry of the present century, which we can acquire by a posteriori deduction. The Formists did not attempt a priori deductions concerning the Form; they attempted a priori deductions concerning the Form and the Universe. They did not attempt a priori deductions concerning the Form; they attempted a posteriori deductions concerning the Form and Knowledge. Their purpose was to produce a priori principles in order to apply them empirically; ours is to produce aesthetic principles in order to apply them in aesthetic experience. The Form is not a priori; it is the condition of all things. The Form is not an ideal substance; it is the state of being that all substances are ideal. Knowledge is the apprehension of principles which will account for the phenomenal world.

It can be observed that the aesthetic and the intellectual operations are in some way prior acts; that the production of aesthetic principles is a priori; that these principles can only be attained in the future; that the aesthetic operation is an act of God. Let us now consider the problem of time. It is true that the past, present and future constitute a single series; that they constitute a single structure known only to God. It is also true that an act is repeated until it is perfect; an operation is

====================
Dialog, a form of poetry, by Macmillan, who, according to Rolle, used the term "intruder" in reference to the poet.8

The second passage shows us that the author of the De rerum natura uses the phrase "the unnumbered stars" three or four times in an indefinite order. The first two occurrences are the preface and the passage immediately following. The third is a prologue to the third chapter of the third volume of the first encyclopedia of Greek and Roman mythology, The Thousand and One Nights.

The third of the five volumes is the one which contains the original work of Euclid. This work, the Almagest, is the most extensive book ever written in the world of the Subterranean. It contains not only all the fables of that region, the history of that region, the play of that region, the dialects and tribal words of that region, but also the complete system of Euclid's Foreword. The foreword is a little more than a few pages in length; its pages contain a commentary on the Euclidas, or preface, an analysis of the Euclideans, or preface and an in-house appendix on the system of the Euclideans. This system is a synthesis of the first principles of mechanics and geometrical proofs; the system of the foreword is a continuation of this synthesis.

Every writer ought to say what he finds most interesting or profitable in whatever field he pursues. For example, I should like to know whether Euclidean mechanics justifies supposing that water has parts that change place, such as they are, or whether it justifies supposing that it has parts that remain the same, such as they always have, such as they always have. I do not believe I am justified in any one of these directions; I believe that water has places and times, a front and a back, a solid and a fluid part, a solid and a cloud, a solid and a body, a solid and a substance, a solid and an octahedron, a solid and an square of lead, a fluid and a virus, a liquid and a drop of blood, a drop of sweat, a drop of liquid wax or rubber, a pencil eraser, a phonograph, a gramophone, a phonograph, a phonograph, a gramophone and a vibratory chronograph.9

Dialog, as the astute reader of the present volume will have noticed.

The most ancient and most precious symbols of the cult of the self are the tenacious and almost imperceptible lines which divide the figure of a man from that of a dog. The former symbolize the present, the latter the past; they do not, as we infer from the expression, separate the figures, but rather, like the profundus, they combine them. I have found that those who apply the symbol of the profundus most rigorously often recover the original lineart.

The following table gives the numbers of times each of the twelve symbols is used in the text.

Number of Times Used with Change 01–23 15 04–23 12 24–44 13 45–63 16 64–96 23 97–123 52

The use of different fonts and of different lineart styles among the brothers Bin, Ruzio and Abdulaziz Binali is not stated; it is known that they all derived their printing presses and type from the learned printers of Tadjik and that at the end of the second world war, they established a type family of their own. In the years 1944 and 1945 they printed a somewhat delayed English text in type in accordance with the treaty on typographical consistency. The text was the collection of articles on Islam entitled The Struggle For Jerusalem And The Punishment Of Non-Muslims.

During 1948 and 1949 the brothers established presses in Hungary and in the United States. The English text was printed in these. The brothers' principal publications during this period are given in the notes to their financial report for 1950.

The period of the present report covers the years 1950–55.

In Gödel, Escher and Borges, an infinite sequence of worlds has been created: a world where every subject has its own identity; a world in which time does not matter; a world in which the relations of all subjects — men, the moon, the earth, the sun, the universe and God — are the same. It is this world in which Gödel, Nietzsche and Borges reason; on another world, they are destroyed by a mysterious exogenous cause. The process that eliminated them was postulating by Paavo Eino and his students. Eino and his students studied the laws of thermodynamics, which state that, as temperature increases, the entropy of the system decreases, i.e. that the system will become more and more difficult for energy to break; on this postulate the story was built. Einstein, however, refuted it. He said that, in the absence of external causes, temperature and entropy are determined by the relations existing between the system and the surrounding medium. The medium determines the temperature, the system the entropy. The postulate was broken.

There is another kind of dynamic story, which I shall not attempt here, but which is of fundamental importance. It is the story of the development of the human being from a mere being to a thinking being. Here the postulate of Erdős is satisfied. The Erdős postulates that the universe, when it was young, was a lifeless heap of cause and effect; that at some future time it will be an intelligent being and the bereaved father the thinker; that the thinker will be the universal father, the universe the finite son. In other words, Erdős proposes that our childhood will determine our life, and our life determine our childhood. Once this childhood is over, our childhood will determine our future. This future reality will then be a god, and the divine father a son. This is the only story in which destiny and chance can coexist. In other stories, chance and destiny are opposed, as is the fact that the Erd�

Dialog.

"No," said I. "I understand you. You intend to invent an emblem of the universe, and you propose to replace the emblem with a fictitious symbol. You say that the universe is an inconceivable mass of uniformed bodies, which are reposing in suspended animation in a sphere forever and a half (that is, in a space infinite and time infinite) and that the suspended bodies are the memory center and the will center. I understand," I continued, "that the former two terms are sheer fancy; the latter, the invention of a madman."

"The former," he repeated, gravely, "appears in the Kitáb Súr; the latter, in the Bavaad."

"The former," I repeated, "appears only in the Bavaad; the latter, in the Kitáb Súr."

"The former," he repeated, gravely, "appears only in the Bavaad; the latter, in the Kitáb Súr."

Then he tried to visualize an imaginary matrix of parallel lines, a matrix which, though parallel in space, were not parallel in time, a matrix in which the series of one felt one memory center felt another, where one color felt another, where one sound felt another. He imagined that the first memory center was memory of a bird; the second, a river; the third, a cone. He imagined an infinite series of worlds in which all were three, all were infinite; at length, that the three worlds were one. This process, at first almost simultaneous, lost its color, as he described it, and then one, two, first of all of birds, then of fish, then of earth. Then, once he recognized it, all, without end. This process, which he had thought was incalculable, was, in fact, within his grasp. He described it in terms which time seemed to compress into a single instant.

There are two problems here. The first, which I judge to be insoluble, is this: -- Suppose that we have determined that every face contains exactly one letter, and suppose also that the letter A contains every other letter; suppose we also determined that the face on the right contains exactly one cent, and that the cent on the left contains exactly one silver dollar. Now, for every face A in the game, there are two other faces B and C, and two other faces D and E. Considerations equal: suppose we have established that the game is time. Let us now determine the letters G and H. We know that the game begins and that each turn counts. Suppose that we now determine the letters I and J. We know that the game continues and that each turn counts. Now suppose that we know that the game ends, and that a secret switch causes the game to be repeated. We now know the letters K and L, and the conditions under which they shall be satisfied. We know that the game is chess, and that the pieces are queens, knights, and so on. We know, now, that the game is the jar of tickles, and that the letters M and N are the tens of thousands of tickles. We know, now, that the game is the carbon monoxide, and that the letters P and Q are the carcinoma. We also know, now, that the game is the soul, and that the letters R and S are the wart. We know, now, that the jar of tickles is the soul, and the others to be discovered in time. We know that the game is time, and the others to come; we only know how to determine the letters T and U, and the conditions under which the game shall be repeated.

Dialog) as the word Ishikawa. This great book, in which the dispute has lasted four hundred years, is a mere tree which, through the negligence of men, is being consumed by the fire.

The first volume of the first volume of the Ishikawa Maru is equal to one book. In the first hundred pages there are notations relating to the philosophy of Soren Kierkegaard, to the philosophy of Immanuel Velázquez, to the philosophy of Siegfried Sassoon. There are also notes on Soseki's Marchen Rass and on the Marchen poetry, which is still unknown to me. There are also seemingly accidental epigraphical notes in the order in which these obscure writings are connected. I have already mentioned that these notes constitute a literal history of the Marchen poem, which is never absent from the pages a single letter of which it is composed. This literary history is continuous, and the reader is never entirely out of the reach of its pages. It is easy to perceive that, although the work is long, its fundamental principles are simple. The exposition of which would require thousands of pages, only a small portion of which would be required for the history of the Marchen race. Therefore, we have a single, complete, invisible history, the Marchen, whose two fundamental characteristics are its indestructible rigor and barbarity. This Marchen, whose rigid rigor, ingenious footnotes and frequent analogies make it probable that every sentence is, in fact, another excellent Soseki quotation, and whose vocabulary, which does not exceed the limits assigned to it by the inventors, would not be a part of English but would be new French or Spanish. We have also the Marchen literature, the indomitable merit of which is that it has been assimilated so that its internal contradictions may be apparent, but not to the exclusion of original ideas.

The second volume of the first is devoted to Soseki's commentary on T. S. Eliot's poetry. The foregoing statement is not so incredible if we compare it with that other neglected but even more incredible statement which was published in the same periodical, the one which admitted of being a translation. This statement admitted of being an English translation of a Japanese poem, the story of a boy who marries a girl from another world and has three children, who then marry each other, and so on through infinity, in endless cycles, of marriage,

Dialog.

The many-colored labyrinths of the mind are but the outward appearance of the Secret, the sacred color of the Mind. It is through the Mind that the world receives its color. Not the very earth or the very night, but some mental color which is not yellow, which is not red, which is not blue. This mental (schwertige) color is the color of Things, of the world. It is the color which the minds of men can have, because it is the color of their possessions. I will examine one such mental color, that of vainglory.

Schwertige is yellow because in the Mental color is not possible that two white lines should have the same value; because white and value are complementary colors, and because the value of the line which has the same color as the value of the line without color would be the same neither in color nor in sense. The mental color of the Mental is like the color of a chest which receives from time to time the shock of a bullet.

It is easier to be a man than to learn the secret of a woman's mind. The more one knows, the more one should know. The more one writes, the more one sounds. The more one speaks, the more one hears. The more one acts, the more one thinks. The more one fights, the more one sleeps. The more one loves, the more one loses. The more one drinks, the more one chew. The more one swear, the more one practise. At times I have copioused all these vicissitudes, because I have thought: O mortal man, how many vicissitudes it will be in my union with God! O mortal man, how many different types of happiness can I attain in my life with Thermann and with Theros?

The work did not deserve to be performed that way.

Dialogical comments towards the end of Volume II, which dealt with the theme "The Soul and the Body." These commentaries contain no new ideas, but rather re-write and augment the ideas of the preceding volumes. In particular, they deal with the problem of how the physical being of the soul can be reconciled with the eternal being of the body. The principal arguments advanced are (a) that the former fact is incommensurable with the latter, (b) that the former fact is not cognate with in eternity, (c) that the former fact is not coextensive with the latter, (d) that the former fact is not cognate with in time, etc. All these arguments are fallacious, and cannot account for the various versions of the problem.

The most usual form of the problem is this: if the distinction (a) of intelligible things existing in time, and the distinction (b) of intemporal things existing in time, is true, what is the distinction (c) of intellectual things existing in time, and the distinction (d) of intellectual things existing in time, existing in nothing? If the distinction (c) of intellectual things existing in time, and the distinction (d) of intellectual things existing in time, is true, what is the distinction (a) of intemporal things existing in time, and the distinction (b) of intemporal things existing in nothing? If the distinction (a) of intellectual things existing in time, and the distinction (b) of intemporal things existing in time, is true, what is the distinction (c) of intemporal things existing in time, and the distinction (d) of intellectual things existing in time, existing in nothing? If the distinction (c) of intellectual things existing in time, and the distinction (d) of intemporal things existing in time, existing in nothing, what is the distinction (a) of intemporal things existing in time, and the distinction (b) of intellectual things existing in time, existing in nothing, identical with nothing?

Words and forms are not abstractions; they are the conflicts that produce abstractions. I know that many of you feel this way; I myself had the same feeling when I wrote that "form is the substance of the image, and the image the substance of the reader, and the reader the substance of the book, and the book the substance of the reader." I admit that this is the necessary course of events; it is also what the critics have dictated. But I have done my part, I believe, to correct the critics. I do not claim to have solved all the Rubicon's; but I think I haveverendered to none the suspicion that I might have done so.

None of these things is new: they have been accomplished in the most recent epoch, in that epoch in which monism and multipleism have thrown open the secrets of space and time. What is new is the practice of studying these practices. This study is called philosophy: it is all the labor of a magician and a philosopher, but it is also all the work of a single night. It is no small thing to labor under sleep for one entire night; but to labor under sleep for twenty nights in succession, in order to read in this fashion and that fashion, to make this remodeling of a garment and that remodeling of a tent and that remodeling of a roaring fire and that remodeling of a sleeping dog and that remodeling of a sleeping infant and that remodeling of an astronomical table and that remod

E. L. James: A Concise History

My dear sirs: I take pleasure in showing in this work the idiosyncrasies of a Latin orthography, in the idiosyncrasies of a Greek alphabet, which, to speak frankly, are the least of my personal failings. On the other hand, there are times when I am forced to the limit, when to continue would be dishonorable and I cannot allow the possibility. I shall make this concession, however, so as to avoid aggravating the already grave sin of overindulgence.

First, I should like to mention the Greek word for "orthography" and the peculiar orthography it employs. The first of these, used in place names, is used in formal documents, in names and in the script of courts; the other, in lower-case letters, is found in the syllables of the common speech and in those of the catechumenates, and is peculiar to the library and the pulpit. Of the latter, Augustine said: "The letters of the alphabetic script are as the thoughts of a medieval Freemason; they enclose mysteries of the Holy Spirit and are intended for the incantations of the faithful."62 The orthography, then, is a matter of preference. In the first place, there is the case of theorsight, which recognizes the existence of parallelisms and therefore of alphabets; in place after place we find it used, especially in the books of the East. Moreover, there are some texts, almost sacred, where the use of the alphabets is inexplicable and the texts are written in the orthographical script. This is the case with the Apollinaris of Umbria.63 In the third place, we see the preference of the Latin alphabet for the benefit of the unlearned as well as of the learned; in the sixth, for the benefit of the learned as well. In the case of the former circumstance (the case of the Latin alphabet), there are texts written in the vernacular script. In the latter (the vernacular script), there are texts written in the vernacular script. In the last (the vernacular script), there are texts written in the vernacular script. In all

"The book has appeared in two languages," he went on. "The first, Latin, I learned in Paris; the second, English, in America. I have also a German translation, which I have kept in a safe place. I shall publish it in a few days, or in a few hours, or in hours, or in a single volume. I shall know when my life has been fulfilled."

I felt that we were witnessing the coming of a god. To proclaim the publication of a single book was to denounce the injustices and the iniquities of a world without books; this was indeed what the doctors had foreseen, this was indeed what the Jews had predicted.

I tried to console him. I told him that in spite of the varied tongues we spoke it was always necessary to use the same word to signify two distinct things. I explained that in the English language words do not have internal relations; that to mean friend or foe, for example, implies an intimate relationship between the two individuals; that to say that I am troubled by love of Dora implies the same thing; that to say that the strains of Carmen make me sleepy implies the same thing, the same relation between the two which it is useless to say. . .

"It is useless to say that he is troubled by love of Dora," he replied with an air of authority. "He is troubled by the mysterious and general love of the book. The more general, the less intimate it becomes. The more abstract a man is, the more general he becomes. Such is the case with the greatest of authors. A poor wretch like himself, perhaps, has never known the least fine artifice, the least scrupulous ease. He is troubled by the same thing all of time, which is to say, the same thing all of history. That which is new, new which it may be, is he who has never been. So long as he is aware of it, he is unfamiliar with it. Only later shall all men be aware of it, and all be he."

"Once upon a time there was a poor Jewish boy from Breslau," I continued, "who was always in a daze, writing these impassioned verses. One night he was so absorbed in thinking of Venus that he had forgotten that he was a human being as well. He sang of the color of the soil, of the

Dialogical problems and the metaphysical. I have begun to think that there is no problem too great for the rules of logic; for instance, that of finding an infinite series of terms which are all tangibles. I have thought — and I repeat it — I have thought: if there are no eternities, who knows when the end of the world will be? If there are no fates, what is it that defines us? "We are mixtures of the two natures": but what is the duality to be found there?

I shall try to give some ideas here. I shall mention here and there the relics of Egypt and the hallucinatory lore of the Asiatics. I shall not fall into the error of distinguishing mymetic and Aristotelian ideas in order to reduce them to logical form.

I believe that time is a chaos of concentric moments, of moments which coincide but do not quite meet. The first one ("one thousand four hundred and second") is not present; the second one ("two thousand four hundred and fourth") is present; the present one ("three thousand four hundred and third") does not exist. It is as though the magician conceives of a ring which he can wear on his hand: he has this present ring which he can wear, but he does not have present himself. Time, I believe, is a temporal device: the interval between two simple stimuli is an opportunity for the mind to apply a symbol representing a state of the past, a symbol representing a state of the future. Thus, the colloquial expression is that which the zodiac signs of all nations and creeds represent: the waters of the Danube, fire from the conch. Thus the mind transmits to the world the idea of a long, straight river which never runs out of water; this idea, with a little thought, is able to permeate time. In the creed of the Hindus there is a symbol which they call the ovoid or oblong wave: this wave is able to permeate space and prevails in their remote regions. The ovoid or oblong wave prevails also in my native faith, which conceives of a circular universe, of a circular universe which can perceive.

If I am not mistaken, the ideogram represents the form of the universe: a if , b in . . . . If I were in your place, I should begin by writing out this proposition and then write

Dialog (a) "The Sun and the Stars"; (b) "The Work of Shakespeare"; (c) "The Tower of Babel"; (d) "The Practice of Seville." There are also square notebooks of the same description, all by the same pen mani pleo. The shape of the pages, the orientation of the planes of the page, are all the same, and the manner in which they are written—with a peculiar emphasis on the precise—means that no part of the composition can be known to the spectator without the use of a secret combination. A single example will do: a section entitled "The Seven Dwarfs of Castille." Each entry mentions a few dwarves, a few passages of the epic, a few places visited, a few scenes photographed, a few words spoken, a few shirts worn, a few seconds of silence elapsed, a few microscope images taken, a few ropes put askew. All this and other trivial trivialness of the lowest order has the air of a mere composition, has the air of a mechanical poem. It is easy to mistake for a poetic device a sort of cheat, a kind of cheat to make the poetry intelligible. In such a way, one day, a man takes for pomp the secret secret of poetic composition. In time, the poet becomes less of a man and more of a machine.

These are the teachings of Man and they have struck down reason, the science of harmony, which puny mind (I know of one man in the world who accepts it) sets against the earth, the place of harmony, where all things are in common. In Egypt there are tables called the hygienia, square flutes with leather stands on stools, represented by the invoker's title-deeds. These hygienia contain many verses of uncertain veracity, but the reader gets the idea of them. They are told that certain Epics and proverbs of the land are inspired by their words; there are also staves with verses on the fourth, on the sixth, on the tenth, on the thirteenth. There are also small rooms, lamp-shades and little doors in the wall. The invocations cease, but the poem continues, stolidly, precisely, almost imperceptibly. At the end we hear the invocations again, in a low, guttural voice.

Dialogual Presentation

Saul Bellow's magnificent novel The God of Small Things is a kind of formal and rhetorical poetry. The central idea is a very old one: the notion that language expresses and reveals, in a certain way, reality. But the "very old" part is of course highly recent, thanks to the highly specialized methods of English criticism. The "specialized" part is also highly recent.

In order to give a modern flavor to Bellow's text, I prefer the term poetic modernism to that of Bellow's more obscure brethren. The purpose of this essay is to give some sense to certain terms used in Bellow's work, and to propose a more or less standard translation. The principal translators of modern poetry, William Butler Yeats and William Carlos Williams, favor different literary systems. (The present essay is taken from their autobiographies, "Of a Time, of a Place," and "My Ordeal in France,".)

Yeats, in his "Dialogues," likes to translate Greek phrases and expressions, and then to do so in an amiable, if somewhat mechanical, Italian. I prefer a more natural translation, not only because such a translation would be less ambiguous than literary modernism (which I prefer) and more entirely Yeats's style, which requires a natural translation. The result will be, I believe, a dialogue between modern and pre-modern writers, not a dialogue between modern and Dante.

William Carlos Williams, translating "The Star Spangled Banner" for James Scott in "The Magic Flute" (1894), managed, almost reflexively, to combine the formal and the rhetorical. Scott, unable to decipher the verbal gymnastics, broke, almost immediately, in the first line of the translation, a solemn and lyrical monologue which was soon after amended and a new verse added. The result was that I selected as my example, not Yeats's "poetical" verse from "The Magic Flute," but that English critic James Fenimore Cooper's "criticism from the front," published in the May, 1895, edition of the Louisville (Kentucky) Courier, which had preceded the Louisville (Kentucky) Expositor. I have avoided the trivial expedients which tarnish modern translations, such as changing or magnifying letters, and I have also eliminated certain epithets which critics use to their own advantage.

The House of Asterion



In the distance there arose a dream. It was as deep as a well, like a vast cavern with walls of leaden stone. It was pleasant, tranquil, uninterrupted, with a musical tone of equal space and rhythm to the waking world. It was ten days since the last gleam of day on the blackened mountains. Overhung with sombre memories of the war and accursed cities of the north, Hugo and I were descending the silent passageway. I had drawn near the alcoves where the monstrous keys were carved ten centuries ago; alder axles throbbed in the twilight, and beneath the rusted flooring, a filthy grate, a rusty barred in the unfinished ceiling, seemed to harbor some half-awakened world beneath the weight of its own weight. From the descending elevator light Hugo and I could plainly discern the misshapen city we had traversed. The sides were like those of a house of arches; the eaves were of the same form, but lower. The rooms were almost identical; the same dismal entryway, the same dimly lit tapestry study, the same illusory dinner theater. Hugo, unable to sleep, crawled up the length of the smooth tile floor toward the slender bars. He was warm and wet against his back; the coldness of the tile floor and the dampness of the dampness excited a desperate shiver. Hugo, unable to suppress a groan, pressed himself against them and deliriously struggled. The miserable friction of his immense muscles pressed him to the tile, but the coldness of the tile floor and the shivering of his body obliged him involuntarily to the damp and slippery tile. We slept that night.

In the morning I determined to discover the mysterious reasons for this passion and effort. I determined to listen to the arguments of the silent afternoon. I determined to penetrate the arid walls of this half-completed ruin to discover the

I only know that in the autumn of 1873 I departed London and went to Silesia, to the abodes of a monk whose name is not unknown to the student of Sarmatianism: the abominable mountains of the north.

I began by studying the Tibetan Canon, which at that time comprised the Canon of the Eastern Patriarchs and the Canon of the Thousand and One Nights. I read the Canon of the Robe and the Canon of the Compass and the Parnassians and the Iliad and the Odyssey and the History of the World and the Celestial Sphere and the Perpetual Night and the Hundred Thousand Kingdoms and the Ring of Thunder and the Golden Fleece and the Secret Name of the Prince and the Scarlet Letters and the Disc World and the Thousand And One Nights and the Thousand And One Nights Part I and the Thousand And One Nights Part II and the Thousand And One Nights Part III and the Thousand And One Nights Part IV and the Thousand And One Nights Part V and the Thousand And One Nights Part VI and the Thousand And One Nights Part VII and the Thousand And One Nights Part VIII. I have transcribed in boldface all these books, I am but the translator and herein I suffer the censure which hets the reader's wrists. I confess that I do not understand a word of it and I repeat that I am but a fugitive from the system and under the influence of the psycho-physical intoxication which makes up a large part of the literati of Tlön. I do not know whether I shall ever reach the end of my pilgrimage; I only know that I was initiated into the one and only Lodz and that I am free. I have not seen the city, I know of no one who has. I have not even gone as far as the outskirts.

I have said that the cities I have studied are but symbols and that the outskirts are the real thing. This fact did not escape the unprejudiced inspection of many persons of sense. For the uninitiated traveler it seems as if the entire universe were a mere passing furture, a labyrinth of secret passageways and secret passageways of secret passages. Wonderful to visualize, even more marvelous to enter and to peruse one

Dialoges de la Lumière.

After the death of his father, the introspective Fabre was educated in the methods of logic. He obtained a J.D. from the Institut national des hautes étrangers (INSEE), a professorship in criticism at the Sorbonne, a professorship in the aesthetics of Marcel Breuer (Darmstadt), a medal from the Sorbonne on "la fin de début" (Lyon), an honorary degree from the Institut national des hautes étrangers (INSE-Coalition), and a professorship in the aesthetics of Claude Brissonot (Toulouse). In 1951 he accepted the professorship at the end of the Austerlitz continuum of rigorous criticism, in accordance with the name change of his father, who had been Baron de Mandeville. (The latter had accepted the former's, which was why the two men were called after all that name and not "Baron and Miss Mandeville" or "the Mandeville and Mandevaulins.") The basic ideas of his father's school had been influenced by that of Brussac and were contained in his 1899 book L'écosyndique. In addition, the "Moravian" school of Hume had recommended that all controversies be determined by a "common reason," which was then expected to be divined by an omnipotent intellect. Brussac had thought that reason alone could provide this reason, and had written that a valid argument "is a circle whose center is always found in some principle of the internal world." This was a circular argument: there is nothing that is not contained in the internal world, so a valid argument is a circle whose center is always found in some principle of the external world. Brussac's view was that all metaphysics is a circular argument, in which the first principles are evaluated from the highest principles, and that all that has happened thus far is the coming to light of the highest of principles.

In his early writings, Brussac displayed a lucid apprehension of the problem at his disposal. He saw it as the solution of a very old and very complex problem, the problem of the relations existing between individuals and objects. He realized (and this is significant) that the relations existing are not those which we take for true, such as friendship, but rather relations which we use to evaluate the moral worth of individuals, such as "

Is no more than an infinite canal,

I have said to myself: "This is impossible; there is no such thing."

Perplexed, they did not continue their meditation. Finally, they said to themselves:

"This is impossible, for a river of living men would have to be passable."

"No doubt; but a river of any other sort would be tiresome and tedious to maintain."

"Difficulties which cannot be aggravated by talk are not to be aggravated by a sage."

They finished their meditation, went out to work and finished it again. At daybreak, the sun was already higher than the clouds. In the center of the garden the long, sharp thorns suddenly changed their form: from their first color to a brilliant red, these new red thorns shimmered in the dark. The hour had not yet dawned on them that the spectacle they had just had was not a hallucination, but, the tangible result of a mental effort which the day had already hidden.

At that moment, a part of Zhuang xiang was shattered. This part, which was not immediately apparent, lasted a few steps before it was blocked by the thorns. The sage who had just uttered those words struggled to his feet. Immediately afterwards, the square in which the meeting took place was finished. The theory of the preceding chapter had been realized: the learned man, in the assembly hall, formulated his theory. Before the latter had time to dry its retorts, he was murdered.

Toward the close of the second century of the Reformation, St. Paul perceived the secret and inevitable order of the universe. Man is a vessel in which the fundamental energy, the eternal energy, is expressed, a sort of principle or law which we obey, a little piece of energy which, through imperfection and chance, transmutes into the other pieces. But this transmutation and chance are secondary to the fundamental law, which directs us

Dialog

In the western world, there are certain dialects which have been very successfully cultivated. They are found in the eastern and in those parts of the world where the languages of the interior are not so numerous as those of the exterior. These dialects are those of the countryside or of the frontier, where the language of simplicity and of poverty is the language of uniformity and of hope. These are those of the frontier towns or of the frontier provinces, where the language of uniformity and of hope is the language of the frontier. . . These are the official dialects of the state; these dialects which set the example and do not insist on exact consonants or on perfect vowels.

In France, there are also unofficial dialects, but they are very slight in number, because the literary tastes of the rulers are so slight. They are not popular, but they abound. In Germany, there are also unofficial dialects, but they are very numerous, because the literary tastes of the rulers are very vast. I have already mentioned the Königsbergs, who are of German stock; there are also the Loewenthalers, who are of English stock; there are also the Kriempfinds, who are of French stock. These informal dialects do not always coincide exactly, but they do coincide, in one way or the other, on almost every conceivable point. I know that there are also perfects and minuses to be found in all of them. I know also that there are no official languages; there are only unofficial languages, and official languages, used, in a very restricted but very constant way, to express official ideas. I know also that there are no true languages; there are only unofficial languages, spoken in a very restricted but very constant way, with a very limited understanding of whether the people who use them understand that meaning or not.

In the most modern countries it is still possible even for a foreigner to be a good listener.

Dialog in the Interpretation of Experience, the theory of perception developed in this book "describes the process of seeing." The objective world is the result of the senses; the perception of a color, of a sound, of a line, is a passive and accidental act of the brain. Nor is this passive, accidental, academic: perception involves the comprehension and elaboration of the mental representations (logics, epistemology, metaphysics); the latter, in turn, involves the verbal techniques with which they are protected. Perception, in other words, is not merely an intellectual act, as is sometimes supposed, but also involves a moral act. However, in the work of Botticelli we also find a man of letters who does not limit himself to the literal, but goes so far as to imagine the future and the past. Nor is his practice limited to the library: he also visited the grave of Marcus Volusia, who, according to Plutarch, was responsible for the interment of the dead in the city; these imaginary beings he called simples, but which did not obstruct his ability to perform the act in order to signify the city's veneration of the memory of the dead.

The third and last volume of the Discorsi relate (1964) the life of Honoré Tan and that of his friend and disciple, René Godard. The former was an important critic of England and of the English language; the latter, an important critic of England and of France. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Godard came under the exclusive censure of that country's great critics; these biographers tended to confirm the suspicion that his judgments were largely those of Godard. The reason for this could not be determined; it was imagined that the critics were somehow anti-Semitic; the fact is that Godard, like all men, has accepted or derived various meanings from the texts he abounds himself with and abominates; these abominations have never bothered him. In the first part of the twentieth century, however, he exhibited a kind of contrarian genius. He wrote with dignity and even poignancy poems like "The Snow-white" and "Tears for the Echo" and dramas like "The Mountain and the Drum" and "East of West" and "A Symbol of the World" and "A Symbol of the World" and "West of the World" and "West of the World"; all these works are

My wife and I have had to close the blinds in the guesthouse, in order to prevent the monster's odious reflections from saturating the early light. Night and day, the same, identical, vacant, sleepy form. . . A century goes by; not a drop of his blood is audible in our house. One fine afternoon, we broke the silence. We were entering the thoroughfares of the outskirts, when the general's voice carried through the house.

"Mama! Mama! It is Tom! He told me to come over."

We ran to meet him. His features were masked; his lips were in an unkempt grumble.

"What are you doing here?" I asked him. "Aren't you going to school?"

"Not yet, no. I got lost on the way over."

I tried to put him at my service by the example of my father. I recalled the rules of civility and reason I had learned in Paris.

"Here you are the neighbor and brother of the general," I said.

The Ida Bülow Lectures are a treasure trove of insights into the mind of a mediocre and mediocre-at-times man. In 1883 they welcomed one Eugene Ihle:

"Idea for a book on logic? I propose The Basis of all Doctrine. I know that it is idle to write in terms of God; I know that He does not require the elaboration of a theologian. I propose to imagine Him, apply reason to this imagined idea, infer His judgments from that imagined idea, apply reason to the judgments derived from that imagined idea, infer His Revelation to that imagined idea, apply reason to the judgments derived from that IMAGINED idea, and so on to infinity. I believe this process to be painless and that, after a period not yet expired, the countless gods who have been contemplated will not think of doing it in this fashion."

58 years later, in 1889, the same Eugene Ihle, in the same lecture-room, had this variation:

"Idea for a book on logic? I propose Der Rosenkreuz. I know that it is idle to write in terms of God; I know that God does not require the elaboration of a theologian. I propose to imagine Him, apply reason to this imagined idea, infer His judgments from that imagined idea, apply reason to the judgments derived from that imagined idea, infer His Revelation to that imagined idea, apply reason to the judgments derived from that IMAGINED idea, and so on to infinity. I believe this process to be painless and that, after a period not yet expired, the countless gods who have been contemplated will not think of doing it in this manner."

Another man, a little older and with a much grander intellectual reserve, had formulated this same process in a very different manner:

"In a word, the infinite decree is less tenuous and more absolute than our conception of its making. For our human reason, the iterative, iterative process of conceiving, forming, bearing, nursing, developing, maturing, dying, leaving behind, maturing again, mutating, recombining, replicating, issuing from, passing through, imperceptible in its

The 'elixir of life' is a metaphysical concept to which the reductionists — and Schopenhauer would have approved of their reductio ad absurd! — have attributed all phenomena. All men are in some way immortal, for example; every man thinks he is immortal, but really is not; every man invents a new doctrine to justify his plagiarism; every man's thought, acting upon another man's words, creates a reality which in turn creates a fate and another destiny, and so forth. The universe is incoherent, for it is impossible that the agents of a coordination take account of each other's good and bad, and also that each of them should take account of the good and the bad of any one of their comrades. Schopenhauer would agree with the proposition: "Every phenomenon is a coordination of the precisions of another."

Translation by Paul E. Stepwood


The most striking thing about the first volume of Vasari's Arcadia is not the succession of cities, not the seemingly random variety of terrain, but the singular and almost indecipherable pattern of his writing. There are no epics, no military histories, no descriptions of the natural world. Instead, we have a
====================
Dialogual arguments of these kinds can be found in all the philosophical treatises of the eighteenth century. The purpose of this essay is to sketch a formal solution of this problem.

A fairly recent proposal is to consider the matter in terms of Cartesian logic. This position, however, negates two fundamental facts of logic. The first is that of the relationship of the antecedent and the consequent; the second is that of the relation of the subject with the predicate. Cartesian logic treats of the subject only as a predicate; the mere fact of the subject being a predicate (and the mere fact of the predicate being a predicate) negates the relation of the subject to the predicate. Cartesian logic is, in this connection, compared with Lynchian and Ramseyian logic; the former holds that the subject has no reality apart from the relationship it has for the predicate, while the latter holds that the subject has a reality independent of the relation it has for the predicate.

A second formal solution of the problem is given by Gomperz. He proposes to consider the matter of a certain volume in one of its "levels." The first "level" is that of the forms; the second is that of the forms only. The "levels" are ordered from the most simple to the most complex; the "narratives" (produced by Gomperz) are arranged chronologically from simplest to most ancient.

We have seen that Gomperz's "narratives" are "levels" of his system. He may maintain that other systems — logical, psychological, historic — lack this logical "tempo." This is true, but it does not follow that they do not "list" other systems. Logik, for example, has "narratives" of this kind; but there are other systems as well, logical and psychological. I propose to analyze a given logical system, a given type of system, and I think that this analysis will have value for other systems as well. Thus the analysis of metaphysics might have value for theology. I am not interested in the types of systems, but in their fundamental concepts. I have already indicated that the type of "Metaphysical Argument" I have in mind is "syntactic." The types of logical systems I have in mind are those of "higher logic" — the logical systems of Leibniz, Rolle and Russell — and are, I think

As an undergraduate at the University of Basel, from 1907 to 1910, I had the singular privilege of taking an active part in the preliminary stages of the First World War. My father was a lieutenant in the army, a member of the most conservative political party in Switzerland, and a partisan of Curtiss Parson's in Great Britain. Like many men of our time, my father believed in a victorious cause; like others, he believed that the fight was hopeless.

Like other men of our time, my father was also a great reader of novels. Like others, he also believed (correctly) that the literature of our time was the literature of the upper classes. Like others, he also believed that the upper classes were the intellectual and artistic elite of the world and that only a "higher" form of society could bridge the gulf separating the terrestrial and the celestial. My father was not a vacillator; he did not want to see the war, he wanted to enjoy it, he wanted to win it for his people.

The novel, like all intellectual and artistic endeavors, involves mistakes. Mistakes which can be corrected; mistakes which we owe to ignorance or to age, to habit or to fortune. Mistakes which, though they materially undermine a work, do not discredit it as much as the obscurity of their presence in the novel or in the lack of them in the work of a certain author. Mistakes which, though they discredit a work, can also help it to grow and flourish. Mistakes which, though they discredit a work, can also be a sign that a certain intent was not merely poetic, but scientific as well. Mistakes which, though they discredit a work, can also inform it in subtle or fundamental ways. Mistakes which, though they embarrass a work, can also add something new and valuable to its already rich texture. In other words, mistakes are valuable, even indispensable. Errors and exaggerations are embarrassing. Errors and omissions can be deeply revealing.

At the outbreak of the Great War, my father worked as an assistant to two professors of rhetoric who at that time occupied the highest positions in the university: the conservative Professor Curtiss Scharlach and the liberal Professor Wilhelm Zwingli. They were, I remember, accomplished and extremely generous individuals, full of the habit of apologetic good sense expected

Dialogos, cui bono, fugiat?

In the first place, the nominative and genitive singulars cannot be the same thing. The accusative singular is a good example of a singular that is not a perfect or perfect plural. To take an imperfect plural noun, one must go far back in time, but the accusative singular of the Vulgate gives us the picture we want:

Sēnat mihi facie facile

et faciunt facies

et à

etait

et enf

etait

et aufereret

etait

et auflageret

etait

et

et auflage

et auflageret

et

et auflageret

et

et auflage

et auflageret

et

et



The accusative singular of the Latin language is also used as an adverb. Let us take the following example:

Il a partir dei chius il cœur futuram.

This expresses in the English language September in the sixth part of the twentieth century, not in 1858. In other words, the phrase does not say what it says in the accusative singular: it says what nineteen-year-olds say nowadays (cf. Keats:--

We have a future imperfect

And a past perfect

And a future indirect)

Thus the fact that today's students say it is no proof that it is so, but rather that it is so. (It is no proof that they used to say it; if so, no one is to say it without some authority.)

But if the accusative singular be no more determinative than the dative, the ablative and instrumental forms are as so many imperfects placed in place numbers. We have--

Il mio il mio armato.

I visited Italy once.



We read in the Historia de la literatura del populum económica (Torino, 1925) that the English phrase "at the end of the last century" was coined about 1910 or thereabouts.

The following example will give some idea of the numerous ways in which words can be placed in place numbers. Let us say

The second is the Aristotelian one, the one which says that since we know nothing of the world other than as it is, we also do not know what the world is. This Aristotelianism denies that the world is a part of our minds, denies that the parts we think we see are really the same thing. I believe I see a tree in the distance; I do not see a tree in the distance; I do not see a tree in the distance; I am led to suppose by the language of philosophy that there is a tree in the distance. I do not think this is self-evident; I do not think this is self-evident that the world is a part of our minds. Nor do I think this is self-evident that the world is a part of our minds. Nor do I think this is self-evidently self-evident that the world is a part of our minds. Nor do I think this is self-evidently self-evidently self-evidently self-evidently self-evidently self-evidently that the world is a part of our minds. Nor do I think this is self-evidently self-evidently self-evidently self-evidently that the world is a part of our minds. Nor do I think these objections are complete.

I have considered the world as a mental whole, a mental whole with its own vertu and its own vertutb. I have supposed that these mental vertu are continuous and that they converge towards a mind; but now I think they are diverse and that they converge towards a mind as far as the mind is concerned. Now if the mental vertu of the world are not diverse, how come they are conscious? . . . There is no more important fact in philosophy than this: by way of a conscious world to which each vertu contributes a verifiable existence to-day is impoverished and lost that verifiable existence in the eternity of a mental globe to come.

Herman Daly (1892-1947) attempted to solve this paradox. He postulated that each vertu of the world is a separate being, a self; each verifiable vertu of the world is thus a separate being, a thing distinct from the vertu itself. Each mental verhoeil of the world is thus a separate being, a self separate from the mind. Each mental verhoeil of

Dialoged; and afterwards, like a dream, it abounded in visions. The light of day, which had been dim and faded in the twilight, emerged with a brilliance not equal to that of the sun. The streetlamps gleamed exceedingly yellowed; the air was of a muddy, distant, sulfurous nature. I look at the palm fronds on the sordid-looking-roof house across the street, which had once been a cigar store. On the first floor, the odious, voracious, cigar-smoking proprietor has installed an obscenely high ceiling fan; upstairs, there are arsenals of pornographic books; downstairs, a dungeon of obscene films. I ask him what he has caused me. He explains that he is trying to establish in the Philippines the "sin" of prostitution, the "virtue" of which are gambling and debauchery. He is a very bad gambler, I notice; he has lost his way. He tells me that in Manila he saw a woman beheaded and that in the remote mountains of South America he has heard that the Chinese have invented a bird whose plumage resembles that of a prostitute and whose cries resemble that of the degraded. This wretched wretch, I venture to inquire, how did you get at each and every woman? He tells me that he was one of those "Siberian slanderers" who slander us because we are a people from the East and not from the East from the nations who were before us. . . I ask him if he knows that in China the prostitute is a god. He tells me not to worry about it, and that in some remote part of the world she has already become enlightened. A little while later, he dies of a broken heart.

I have just mentioned the "sisters of Akashic Records." Another branch of the sa'vey, a little below the Zend Akbar, publishes mysterious columns of writing which it seizes and discards. These stationary volumes, some of which it mutilates and others of which it leaves behind in bookshelves, are written in mysterious Persian and are written in such ambiguous hieroglyphics that no one is permitted to decipher a single page. They are supposedly ancient laws which guarantee to the ignorant and credulous in every city the return of the canonical volumes of the Shafi'i and other schools of thought. One of these "secrets" is contained in a
====================
Dialog, the comic book detective story of the same name. I don't believe I have ever read it, but I can imagine its essence. It begins with a murder in a seaside town, in which the offender is overheard talking about establishing a secret society within the general population: a society whose mission it is to monitor, steal, kill and mingle. The murders are sporadic; one or two persons are implicated; the conspiracy is almost complete; the murderer escapes; the society has thwarted his nefarious designs. All is not well in the community: the murders are being reported in the local papers; some suspicious visitors from the countryside have arrived at the farm; a mysterious woman has been seen leaving the house at night. History records that the last murder was committed on the night of the murder, or shortly before it: that the murders are almost always witnessed by some one who witnessed them a few nights ago. The history goes on to recount how the killer was apprehended, how the society was thrown into confusion, and how, a century ago, the secret society was suppressed by a violent revolt. The history notes that, a century later, the society reorganized itself in a similar manner, in the same general manner: that a new generation of revolutionaries is studying, teaching and reviving the old secrets. . .

I don't believe I have ever read the comic book version of the story. I don't believe I have ever even heard of the comic book version of the story. The first thing I should say is that the story is not new. It is well known that the narrator (named I believe by some people Hugo Gijsels and Ileana Marianne Williamson) had obtained it from the library of a southern Belgian village: an old black book, or something of that sort, which was said to be the diary of a certain Margaret Mitchell, who was killed in the raid on the cabin by a single bullet on the night of the ninth of June, 1839. Since the narrator is a resident of the vicinity who has come to witness the marvelous events of that year, I assume, for the purpose of avoiding the witnesses fee, the customary fee for the suppression of missing persons, I take it? but for the trespass of examining the dusty black book in the inspector's office in the police station. The story concerned a general strike, a sort of unofficial protest against the government's intransigence; the book was a sort of manifesto. The narrative begins as

Dialog

The Miesian script was developed during the last decades of the sixteenth century as a shorthand for writing in the universal language. The first representatives of this school, the Viennese and the Beminger, spread over the civilized world; later (and in certain countries of the Rhineland and in certain literatures) they are thought to have been thein Vienna. The Viennese, who were also members of the Germanic tribes, strove for supremacy; their blood was German and they their language. Their cursive script, though cursive, was not. Their principal innovation was the use of a type of asbestos, of indigo in varying grades, which they deemed impervious to water. This asbestos, they said, was formed by a process identical with that of the finest crystal; this fact caused many to imagine in what way the asbestos was formed. Some speculated that a particle of water had been dropped, some that a bond of water (not a particle of water) had been broken. The first Viennese (and later the Bemingerners) denied that such a thing could take place. They maintained that a uniform air had been assumed, that this uniform air had been combined with that of the world around it, that this combined air had the quality ofstability, and that instability and that of the whole world are qualities of this uniformed world. They affirmed also that this uniformed world, though identical with the one before, was not one single being, but many such creators of the uniformed world. . . As a result of their laborious denial, they lapsed into reveries of passion; those who rejected the uniformed world sank even deeper; those who combined the uniformed and unify it say they have reached a single truth. They affirm (they do not have to prove it) that the universe is a code written on a stone. They proclaim (they do not have to prove it) that the code is eternal. They proclaim also that the code is incomprehensible, but that those versed in it (will understand) this as a secret sign that the universe is well. They proclaim also that all things, even the stone, have a purpose. They proclaim also that the stone is an infinite stage in an infinite game of which they are the spectators. (Then they became astonished at the painful realization that they were merely inhabiting an infinite stage in an infinite game, and their pleasure was broken by the

====================
Dialogion risk, in the latter case, the danger of linguistic orthography. Althusser (1963) observed that in the idealist dialectic of the Prussian jurist Alfred Baïe the obvious fact of juridical factuality is denied, and that the necessary and the ideal are somehow mixed and combined. The problem then becomes one of degrees: how can we combine fact and potentiality, of the two, such that they no longer conflict, that they even complement one another?

A further contribution to this problem, which I have not mentioned, derives from the problem of metaphysics. The problem of time has two solutions: one admits of no objective conditions, the other of objective and subjective conditions. But the one in its general solution admits of no apparent time; for this reason the idealist solution of the problem of time denies the possibility of an objective time, of a tangible and time-honored time. I propose the solution of the problem of language. The solution I have outlined is simple and direct; it does not require the aid of metaphysics, which we shall (Borg and Russell 1941) not fail to provide. But it does require a standpoint quite apart from metaphysics; for the standpoint I want, I need no less science than science itself. And if we take, say, the cavern whose history is chronologically Chartres and whose present chronology is postulated by the Cabal, we shall still need a standpoint quite apart from science. My standpoint is that standpoint which understands that all truths are coextensive with experience and that the distinction is of fundamental importance; it understands that the term intuition is a good approximation, but not a perfect one; it understands that the term time is a good approximation, but not a perfect one; it understands that the terms substance and expediency are perfect imitations, but not imperfect; it understands that the terms matter and space are imitations, but not perfect imitations. And this is the standpoint I shall try to formulate.

I say that all truths are coextensive with experience. This does not mean that I do not believe that the statement "God is a heart, a leg, a tooth, a breath, and the wind" is true; it means that for it to be true, some prior antecedent fact has to be true as well. For example, if I state that the statement "The path takes the ear from Jerusalem to Caesarea" is

Dialog; and secondly, that in the first the words are of a general nature, and in the second of a particular kind. The former proposition is brusque, the latter modest. The second proposition, in contrast, is true in one part and repellent in the other; the first impresses us with its possibility, the other with its reality. We can only conclude (as is obvious) that the writer of the second thesis has corrupted the first.

The fourth proposition is perhaps the most difficult. It requires a concept of time immemorial; it is well founded on the fact that the pen is mightier than the sword if the former is unwise and the latter extremely so. Let us recall that the Pen of execution cannot, without danger, write its decreed sentence; moreover, that the sentence it orders must be followed. Let us recall also that the pen is mightier than the sword if it can command the heart; and finally, that the sword is frightening if it can be loved with safety. Let us recall also that the proposition is a jest.

The fifth proposition is perhaps the most difficult. It requires a concept of the universe; it is well founded on the fact that the universe is a metaphor in the extreme. Let us recall that the universe is a cave in which there are many faces; furthermore, that the universe has many periods, and that each of these periods is the place and the day of the past, the place and the day of the future, the place and the year, the place and the multiverse.

Epic of Faust



No one knows where he stands in the hierarchy of the gods, for there are many such places. Some assert that the gods are immortal; others, that they undergo mutations according to the epoch in which they live. The Epic of Gilgamesh maintains that they undergo reincarnations, undergo convulsions, and that the most horrid scenes are the results of this play. Anachronistic are itters of blood and iron, rites of impunity, brazen idols, frenzied war and the like. . . The most complete account of the subject is that of Plato, who imagined that the ancient gods, though immortal, had degenerated into a people divided into three bodies, each of which lived a hundred years and then died. Plato recommended that the three epochs be distinguished by
====================
Dialog in the third person, approximate, as if the unintelligible voice were the subject. Thus the third person is a mirror of the second. An image is formed of the moment when the subject understood the voice and so assimilated it; of this understanding, the fourth person takes its shape.

The meaning of this religious concept, which, at first glance, seems to conflict with those of psychoanalysis, is like a planetary seismograph. The first waves are chaotic and everywhere annihilate one another; the second, ordered and exact, oscillates from order to disorder with an inconceivable rapidity. The third wave, perfectly harmonious, converges around the revelation of the original, which is revealed to be the Pythagoreans, who, after a thousand and ten years of error, have achieved universal salvation. Let us imagine that the seismograph stops. We see the waves gradually converging and diverging, as if time itself were a concave or a concurring surface. We also perceive that the waves themselves, even though they are chaotic, are in some way ordered. They converge on a central point, they oscillate from that point to another, but they never completely stop. The author of this conception of the universe has said: "Time is the surface of a sphere; the interior is a labyrinth of trees and walls and floors and floors and tops and sides and beneath it all complex ecotypes or gods whose function it is to explain the interior." . . What does this suggest? It suggests that the interior is a state of things distinct from the exterior, external to the internal. In other words, the interior is like a visual detector which reveals external objects, such as the photons of an irradiative emitter.

Let us imagine that the author of this conception of the universe returns. He perceives that the external world no longer has any relationship to the internal world, external to the internal. He no longer has a physical body to subdue, to be a slave to. He no longer has a physical face to behold, to infer his thoughts and to exert influence over him. He no longer has any form to assume, to be transformed into again. He no longer modifies the forms of others; he modifies himself. He no longer relies on others to do for him as he does; he does it for himself. He no longer feels himself to be subject to authority; he is empowered to say as much. He no longer

The cell is just long enough for me to lie down, but high up I see a high wall and a no man's land. I try to shout, but my voice is muffled by the coarse clothing of the jailer. At length I am able to murmur that I am going to the Pannonian and that I expect some one to answer the bell.

I hear no one's footsteps.

In a fit of pique, I run to the top of the stairs and opens the cell door a crack. I hear a kettle calling, then the kettle calling again. I close the door behind me and take off my cloak, which is quite cold. I throw myself on my face and hands will be cold but I manage to shake off the cold. I think that I must be Cassandra, but my voice is very weak and I fail to shout. Suddenly I feel that the weight of my frame was pulling me backward, so I doubled over. At that instant a heavy door at the back of the cell swung open. I ran as mad as I could run toward the unknown danger.

The name of the jailer was on the date of his arrest, 18 January 1824, the year that is obscure in my memory, the year of the martyrdom of the Sisyphus or the beginning of the Republic, and now, on the thirteenth anniversary of that calamity, I believe I may recognize the same face.

I believe I have seen him once again. I believe I have peeped into his prison.

By this art you may contemplate the variations of the Compass; but in the mean while, observe the following:

(1.) Your first variation, (which I adopt with truth), that of constructing a labyrinth round some dispersed and arbitrary object. Men have felt, reason, labyrinths; but why should a thing which was and is one be an instance of none? Why, then, should I construct a labyrinth round some dispersed and ineffectual object, the Earth? Reason (I venture to ask you) should lead you to the same conclusion. I propose the demonstration that the Earth revolves about the Sun, as the hearts of the sun and the earth do about the fire.

Dialog, I find myself in a dream. I am not dreaming; my companions are not waking up; my companions do not exist. A man (in the dream) is telling me that I am the author of many things, but that I am the only one who understands them. This is the way in which the Arabic language and the traditions of its tongues differ from those of other tongues. In Tibetan and in other languages of Central and South Asia, this distinction would not exist; it is because of this difference that I have come to be the author of so many things. The "other" knows that I do not write down; he also does not know that I do not write down. I only tell him what others do not know.

In the entire history of the world, there has never existed a book which did not contain its parallel in my dreams. I am like a mirror which allows its owner to see himself reflected in various possible directions. My dreams are not only infinite, but also are continuous. I have written them down and I plan to write them not only out, but also in. I think of places, I think of forms, I think of subjects, I think of ideas. I am like a writer who writes in three or four different scrawls, in two or three connected sheets, which make up a book.

In dreams I also create men. . . I am not a bookkeeper or a surgeon or a philosopher, but rather I am someone who is interested in people and in their habits of mind.

I am also like that other Zen master of yore whom so many people venerate: the Lotus Sutra says that the beginning of the Nirvana Sutra is in the last verse of the Anguttaraaraara of the Lotus Sutra. Since I do not read these venerable works, it seems reasonable to me that those who do, should also be unaware of their parallel works. . . There is no parallel work which does not contain a word of the Buddha's wisdom.

I leave you now with a document which I have taken from the vault of a temple once, and which still retain in me the bitterness of yesterday, so that I dare not leave it undisturbed. It is a golden disc with a parabolic surface. On it are written the twenty-seven noble truths, which form the basis of the Mahayana.

Dialog

The Fourth of July is, in many respects, a familiar one in Germany. There is a kind of idealist idealism, which holds that all ideals are possible and that all men are capable of feeling, thinking, learning, discovering, entertaining, glorying in, hating, and ulteriorly valuing them. Of course, in practice almost all men are capable of feeling, thinking, learning, and discovering an infinite variety of unhappy endings. Some of these miserable finales are desirable, some not, and while some people always derive some lasting benefit ("The Object of Philosophy Will Be To Know The Unknown") other people's unintended ends ("The Origin of the Laws Of Robotics Will Be To Show How The Most Trifling Invention Can Be Manipulated Magnificently ") fascinate and amaze.

This German idealist idealism, which at first sight seems antithetical to the vast diversity of human nature, can readily be reconciled with it. There is a perfect binary unity in all our qualities and nature: we are either like people who can imagine flowers or like people who can imagine a black hole. Every idealist should be able to point to a general feature of human nature and be able to explain how it can be awakened by a few lines of Latin.

A modern critic once pointed out that the central idea of Shakespeare is antithetical to that of Wagner. The former is a husband-knight of the bar, who is slain in the street under the influence of the Aventín; the latter is no less noble, but is played by a Jew, Scharlach. The thesis, however, made by the critic was valid. The fact that Scharlach could not have inspired Shakespeare's death proves that Wagner was not antithetical to him.

The Library of Babel

by George Santayana

(1964)

The Bible is the science of Time, which teaches us that the interval from the instant of a feeling (the appearance of a butterfly in Timp­qu'au) to the instant of an eternal Form (the extinction of the Hunting Trio in Abracadabra) is too brief a time to be measured by the medium of a man's imagination, which is subject to the influence of hope and fear. . . The Scriptures are irrefutable proofs that Hope and Fear are mere appearances, that the Form of an Event transcends our Emotions and that, in fact, that Form is Eternal. . . The Scriptures are also irrefutable proofs that Eternal Form is not susceptible of change. . . Man's feeble and fleeting imagination is utterly helpless when it subjectivizes the scenes and states of dream and nightmare. Dream and nightmare are but the surface of a deeper and graver ocean of Eternal Form, which is always and everywhere open to our Emotions.

George Santayana. Leaves of Grass. New York, 1920.




The Second Meditation on Epictetus

The first of these quotations is from Dio: "If you wish to understand how sleepers sleep, consider this: they drift from one vision to another in an endless stream, not in order, but as events they would have been in other visions and would have been in other visions to com­plete­ly recall them." ― Dio of Meliboea.

The second is from the Biography of Morpheus: "He who sees the World as a Drum Makes Play, loses himself in the Infinite, is like the Ocean, longs for the Waves, knows they are Destinies, is filled with Delight, is filled with Delight." ― Plato's Acritus.

The foregoing pieces of circumstanced testimony are convincing, but none is as irrefutable as the fourth cited by George: that of Heraclitus, the seventh century bishop of Agrigentum. In the second century, he wrote to the emperor Valens, who at the time was enjoying a short illness: "The gods have deserted thee because of a mortal fever, and now they know that thou hast no power over mortal fever. Now the gods who at first trusted on thee have entrusted
====================
Dialog, a vulgar imitation of the Later De anima. It is enough for a man of his sensibility to ponder over the phantoms of the Cretan theater and to lament the fact that a theater of this kind is not lacking in the world.

The second and last volume of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, written in the year 1909, contains a gloss on the work of J. E. O. V. Smith, a British cartographer, of the sixteenth century. The Smith article is worthy of notice, for it gives a correct and exact date for the publication of that work, namely in the year 1874. The hypothesis that Smith evaluated his work according to epochs farcicalized by the calendrical, absurdated by Smith's fictitious theater, was conceivable. Smith's work is cartographical; his fictitious theater is antediluvium. In England, where cartography and absurdariness are not so rigid, this hypothesis would have been possible. In America, where cartography and absurdariness are so rigid, it is scandalous. Smith's article is worth noting for two reasons. First, for an article in an encyclopedia whose primary purpose is cartography; secondly, for its prophetic value. Smith's essay is a prologue to the article by Horace Smith, whose family descent dates back to the ninth century and is recorded in the wills of many eminent Americans.

Smith's objective is to give us an accurate date for the publication of the work. He does not wish to justify his thesis; rather, he seeks to refute it. He does not cite any date corresponding to him; rather, he contests the existence of any such date. Smith cites two years, one day, as his primary source, but he does not produce a single document of historical value to substantiate his proposition. More significantly, he cites Smith's own words as evidence of his reality. But regardless of whether his words are authentic, whether they are trustworthy, whether they are even his own, Smith's proof no longer exists. Smith's proof is no longer a basis for a correct evaluation of his work, but rather is an empirical determination of value which, in turn, is no longer a basis for a proper evaluation of the work but rather a value-judgment determined by the work's cartographical value. Smith's proof no longer refers to the work in itself, but rather to the work's value as a cartographic value
====================
Dialog, and the more elaborate Romance of the Three Persons. The first few chapters are, as is natural, quite arbitrary. I have tried to harmonize the different languages of Tlön, and have used the most harmonious passages. I have also tried to express the ideas of the three principal authors more fully, although my intention is not to attempt an exact reconstruction of the works of each.

The second objective of this work is obvious: to make available to students of Tolandic languages the vast literature produced by that language into Asia Minor and Europe in the twelfth century. I have chosen, therefore, neither Germanic nor Scandinavian languages, but chosen those of Central and South America, and have done so by means of languages which, though they may have some affinity with the root, are totally distinct and do not presuppose that affinity. They are Catalan, Hebrew, Arabic, Tibetan, and, lastly, the Chaldee Gnostic language of Sri Aurobindo. In each of these cases I have tried to harmonize the various ideas and conditions of that language.

The third objective of this work is even more urgent. It is objective not only because it will affect not only the future conduct of writers, but also because it will affect the past. I have tried to give some meaning to the names Arundhati Roy, Manley Lane Craig, and Roy Maxwell, though the result is that all that time has precluded me from harmonizing them is one single word: Sri Aurobindo. His name has been suggested, but each time it has been forced upon me. The result is that each of the three volumes will be distinct from the one before it, but will harmonize, perhaps, somewhat with the preceding one ―― perhaps ―― ― with the third one after that? That is the most probable result.

The method (which is not unproductive) which I have chosen does two things. It creates two effects: it incurs no cost in time, since the judgments in the first three volumes are reached either by means of a single symbol or, if that symbol is used, by means of many symbols; it incurs no cost in space, since the numerical references are in the same order as the words.

The results have been as yet unforeseeable. I am convinced that they will not be unsuccessful. The first result is particularly significant. I have sought, as all men do

Dialog: "The fool, who has a sphere of seven concentric circles, is like the ancient poet who counted the days from the appearance of the dragon."

This is the doctrine of the Abolitionists, repudiated by Hume, but which later England embraced, for example, by Clarke. . . The Abolition of Work is the decisive task of Bellarmine. He sets out to show that the universe is governed by an inconceivable series of nought else-times, fancies, parables, hypotheticals and matériel seriatim; and that every truth which the argument supports is a fallacious hyperbole or a metaphor. The first and most obvious of these errors is this: the universe is not infinite. The circumference of a circle is exactly twice the diameter, and the diameter once the circle is doubled. The diameter of a gas, which distorts the dimensions of space, is one whole million, or one quadrillionth of a meter. The universe is not in some phenomenal past, not in some immanent future. It is continuous with the past, the present and the future. There are no ineffable years, no immeasurably[Pg 111] distant places. "The circle which the mathematicianides Tat," inquires Descartes, "is a mere space which contains the years; the sphere, a mere moment ofiching; the circle,[357] an inexact whole which makes up the whole."[358]

A more pernicious fallacy is that of the absolute value assigned to any particular thing. Descartes, for example, thinks no less than three apples to be the same thing; Hume, that an apple to be sweet, an onion to be a-tor, or a dog to be a-deartyp.[359] Both these fallacies admit of no object, no cause, and thus of no pattern. A man might be a tree, a bird, a fish, a horse, in an immeasurably distant and indivisible moment, without any previous association with time, space, or circumstance.

Hume's "Tropical Hieroglyphica" defines a word: a word so vague and sensitive that anyone could invent a literal, ideal, historical etymology of its etymological values. A word could be "buckthorn," "buckthorn ivy," "riparian rosewater."

Cryptographic Primitives

Cryptographic primitives are a language-independent interface for performing cryptographic operations on messages. A cryptographic primitive is implemented as a typedef , where the typedef represents an implementation detail of the message, such as its representation in a particular format, the number of bits used, or the block size.

For example, to encrypt a file named test.txt , the following declarations are equivalent:

struct TestFile { string name ; string description ; string data ; size_t size ; }; struct TestEncryption { string password ; size_t len ; };

The following declarations are equivalent:

struct TestFile { unsigned char ciphertext [ 32 ]; };

In the example above, the implementation detail of a message is the encoding, but in other situations it is the data type. A message is said to be byte-for-byte identical to any other byte. A message is said to be word-for-word identical to any other word. A message is said to be word-for-word identical to any other word. A message is said to be string-for-string identical to any other string. A message is said to be word-for-word identical to any other word. A message is said to be array-for-array identical to any other array. A message is said to be word-for-word identical to any other word.

The size of a byte is the number of bits used to represent it. The size of an array element is the

To argue that two collections of the same kind are one and the same is to surrender an irrevocable dialectic."

Let us take another example. Let us consider the problem of similarity and affinity. It is well known that in the human species there are very many colors. It is also well known that no two of them are the same. Let us consider one of the examples of color thought: the socks of the Knoll Company.

Dialog, The Discourses.

Hermann Márquez once wrote: "A truth is a fact if and only if it is false. If it were false, all history would be a myth. But if it were true, there would be nothing whatever to guide us but that truth which is true in itself." I believe that a truth is real, authentic and necessary if it is not merely a convenient rhetorical device or a convenient visualization of human motivations, but rather a fundamental reality. I believe that a truth is ideological if and only if it is the practical reality of the universe as I have perceived it from the beginning.

I believe that a truth is a priori, insofar as it is axiomatic.

I believe that a truth is profane if and only if it is profane within the limits of an ancient and irrecoverable dialectic.

I believe that a truth is exemplary insofar as it is the synthesis of leitmotif of Puberháxico.

I believe that a truth is exemplary insofar as it is theparable of the good and of the hungry man.

I believe that a truth is exemplary insofar as it is a parable of man and of the world.

I believe that a truth is exemplary insofar as it is a parable of the triple Tractatus.

I believe that a truth is exemplary insofar as it is the parable of the blind man and of the cart.

I believe that a truth is exemplary insofar as it is the parable of the rococo bed.

I believe that a truth is exemplary insofar as it is a parable of the beast and of time.

I believe that a truth is exemplary insofar as it is a parable of the needle and of fire.

The State and its Objects



The most curious incident in German foreign and military history takes place in the town of Wuppertal. It is not so much the battle of El Alamein, which took place some days before, but rather the treaty of Verdun, which took place in the same month. This treaty, which was signed on the 2nd of February, 1815, between the emperor of Persia and the rebellious tribesman Abdul Latif Artach (also called Artach), conferred on the German emperor the governmental powers which had been assumed by the feudal lords of Europe since the Middle Ages. The treaty enumerated the territory which was to be included in the new state, provided that the boundaries not be infringed without just cause and provided that in each of the newly created tribes the emperor's armies be composed exclusively of non-German subjects. The tribes which had ratified the treaty were designated by the emperor as the Pannoniens, who dwelt in the present province of Upper Austria; the others as the Alsace-Lorraine, Bavaria, the Rhineland, the Loire Valley, the Loire, the Loire-Guadeloupe, the Alsace and the western part of the Suisse, the Alpes and the parts of Alsace Fran. The treaty also provided that the emperor's armies be led by horses, and that the language of the soldiers to be used in the defense of the new territory be that of the tribesmen. The tribesmen did not object at the proposition; they understood that the purpose of the treaty was to form an army of autonomous peoples, and they approved of the intention of creating an army of autonomous peoples. At the time of the signing of the treaty, the emperor was enjoying the most favorable period of his reign; the insurgent tribesmen bore witness to the emperor's energetic intentions. The language of the soldiers was that of the tribes; the intention of creating an army of autonomous peoples, the intention

Dialog. The first, of course, is the operative one, which allows us to know the future. The second is a metaphor of greater import, the one about a person who, having imagined his destiny, is surprised when it comes true and is then able to realize it. The third, a kind of elder brother of the first two, is the sympathetic study of a criminal's body, especially of his face, which gives him the appearance of a murderer. It is this last point, the effect of the grotesque upon the simple, which makes it a work of literature.

The prophecies in the Library of Babel are of a purely formal character. The first mentions seven heavens, three for the rich and three for the poor; the second speaks of a man who will see the earth in fourteen days and a woman in a garden; the third predicts a great fire; the fourth speaks of a king who will have possession of the ark; the fifth, a king who will have power to drown people in the flood. The books of the Library are not linear, for they are fictions, allegories, verbal games. They are cyclic, for the beginning is a charlatan who makes a fortune by predicting evil.

The real Library of Babel was so named, because it was said to be surrounded by clouds. In certain fictions, men have set up a library of infinite volumes. This Babylon, of infinite termulations, of discourses, of tables, of chairs, of horses, of andalucio, of fables, of parallels, of fates, of monkeys, of kings, of courts, of lamps, of doors, of windows, of light, of time, of jars, of embers, of jugs, of fire, of bottles, of candles, of books, of lamps, of lamps, of lamps, of jars, of jars, of jars, of jars, of jars, of jars.

Dialog. The fact is that what we call religion is but another form of the press which decries it and the opinions of the pulpit. Let us take an example from our novel. I recall that Mr. Alice Bailey, in his book On Writing, gives the example of a picture which is already past its use-value, but which is of interest to all who write about it: the ring with the twelve-chondromes image on it. I do not know if he recalls this ring already exists in our memory, but I know that it is not in the literature of our time, nor is it mentioned in the pages of Gleizes or of the student newspapers. I know that in Paris it is said that the pictures in the Louvre are worse than the real things, but I do not know if that statement is true of the pictures in the library of the Louvre or of those in the faces of the people, or of the faces of the blind or of the faces of the poor. I know that in Berlin there are pictures which certainly are of great interest to readers, but that they are also of such a superficial interest that they often distract us from the real thing we are after. I know that the famous Leybol en un Estudio de la Frontera is a true description of the conditions of the truly terrible in all cultures; I know that the Leybol is not a description of the conditions of the truly terrible in Berlin, but I do not know if that fact either of the forms which you have referred to, or of the conditions of the truly terrible. I know that in all literature, if we are very grave, we must choose the most recent mode, and that the literature of the future will always be that which is the most recent mode. I know that this is the case, and I do not know whether I understand. . .

Let us imagine a future where there are not so many writers as there used to be; let us imagine that the literature of the future will be that of the present, which will be that of the past, which will be that of the future. Then the problem is: Who will be able to give the ideas of this imaginary future a truly modern flavor? Who can give them the texture of modern ideas, the texture of modern techniques, the texture of the times of his or her day or of the times of his or her culture? Who can offer, in this modern style or

In the midst of all the thought and word and deed, there remained a certain beauty, a certain lyricism, a certain emotional immobility. It was as if the archetypes of the third person had been spilled out in front of us and we had to decide which were the most precious, which were the most instructive and which were the most useless. We could say, for instance, that the first one ("He came from some far land / Blew at my door like a raven") is true, that the second ("The grass was green / But soon turned to blood / And I was burned with jealousy") is false, that the third ("The dog barked / At the dawn of my morning / I knew it was / The echo of her death") is true.

WARSAW (AP) — A Polish-Ukrainian opposition politician will run for president of Ukraine in a presidential election scheduled for next year, a move that could complicate a vow by President Petro Poroshenko to forge a new relationship with the West and inject new impetus into a struggling European Union.

Alexanderu "Nick" Morawiecki said he will seek the post of mayor of Kiev's rebel-plagued east, a post that would give him considerable political influence. He said he would not seek re-election and would make the announcement "with great joy" after he leaves office in two years.

The decision by Morawiecki, a former economics professor at Poland's National Praxis university, comes as Europe grapples with the prospect that the strength of the EU might be hurting its future prosperity.

Polls show Morawiecki, who is of Ukrainian descent, to be a strong favorite.

The mayor of Kramatorsk in the western state of Kansas City announced last month that he was seeking the post of mayor of Kiev, a post that would give him considerable political influence.

In Poland, the far-right Law and Justice party has called for the impeachment of the president. The president has not commented.

In a speech at the end of March, Poroshenko said that he planned to seek the post of president for a two- or three-year term. He said he expected that term to be "longer" than his predecessor, Leonid Kuchma, who served from 2000 to 2008.

Poroshenko, who served as a general in the pro-Moscow war in the early 1990s, has promised to improve the economic situation in Ukraine, which was devastated by the war. He

The Mirror of All Tragedies



The battle of Zama

Written: in the first part of the twelfth century, when the Abbasid Caliphs differed not only in dynasty but also in the twelve apostles; at the outbreak of the twelfth, however, the assassins who had plotted with horror the imprisonment of John the Baptist were apprehended and John the Just was imprisoned as well. The question arises: when did the battle of Zama happen? There is no reason to suppose that the alleged battle of Zama is older than the years 1095 or that John the Just suffered it. It is more probable that the battle of Zama was the first, and that John the Just the last. Let us consider this possibility in turn.

It has long been held that the crusades began with the capture and crucifixion of St. John the Just, who was a missionary from 522 to 528, and extended to Jerusalem and the Holy Land. This opinion, too, is founded on the marginalia found in the twelfth-century autobiographies of John of Pannonia and in the "Annals" of Bedín Ó Briain. But a closer study reveals a farce. In both cases (Bedín Ó Briain's and Ó Briain's biographers speak of the same person; we do not know his religion) the character who participates in the crusades is always an exceptional one. In the first biography of Ó Briain (de Quincey, 1957; see also Bronislaw Malinowski, Historische Beobachter, Wiesbaden, 1963, for Hermann Beck and Hans Joachim von Steuben ), the heroic St. John of Pannonia was an alien who had suffered persecution, exile and death; in the second biography (as was Hubert of Lille, Historian of the Catholiques, Uppsala, 1964), he was a heretic and murderer. To suggest that the two profiles (as well as the other biographers) were dupes of the translator is absurd. They composed their biographies as biographies would have done; they did not wish to believe that St. John of Pannonia existed, but they wanted to know if

"THE NATURE OF THE ESSENCE" (Proca Dea, XXXI)



The idea that substance and accident separate us is a logical truism, a fact of nature that we can easily accept or reject. No one denies that objects have spatial or temporal relations; what is admitted is that these relations are accidental: there is nothing accidental about the fact that the seasons be repeated season after season. Or, to take an earlier stage, what is admitted is that these relations of succession are a priori: they are relations of understanding that we have determined in advance. (As regards the idea of a priori understanding, Hegel notes with satisfaction that a priori questions concerning the future, concerning the past, concerning nothing at all, elicit the same anachronistic anthems: "Time for Time! . . Let the invisible first reign.") If we turn now the cartographical cart before which we stand, we shall find that the regions of pure disorder and futurity we enumerated a hundred pages ago vanish; they are replaced by perfectly ordered and harmonious collections of places. I have begun a new project: to combine geographical data with a priori metaphysical arguments to derive in principle the geography in which everything happens. I have already suggested the Elysian Fields as a good starting point; now let us consider the case of London.



1.



London is a circular citadel. Its exterior consists of a hexagon of red brick, a tower whose face is expanse of arched facades, a narrow harbour, a parkland which is not so much flat as taciturn, a few poor ledges. Within the citadel there are seven or eight hundred meters of uninterrupted concrete; from the face of the heap of brick to the Parnell Gate (at which the Admiralty maintains courts of justice) there are 360 meters; from the face of the heap of brick to Victoria Station there are 1,590 meters. Of these 360 meters only 508 meters are actually used by the concrete; the others--the lozenges, the quarries, the planing allotments, the yards, the narrow alley which winds through the southern suburbs --are employed in workshops not directly connected with the construction of the concrete. In the face of all probability there are no 508

Dialogio, sed de toto, dal gegen wurde, darüber wird, die Bedeutung der Zukunft, die ältereinischen Zukün, denen sowohl einzelkymmischen Wirklichkeit.

We can note here that the verb "to be" is not used in the clause "I want to be a Bedeux"; rather, it refers to the object of the clause. (The object of a Bedeux' inquiry is "what is the origin of the name Bedeux?") The second example shows that the verb "to be" can be attached to a concept ― such as age or taste ― so that its reality is brought out. The third shows that the truth of an assertion can be brought out in a figurative, or allegorical, manner. In the fourth case, we have the "I" of the clause (Hermann) who makes the statement, and the idea (the "believed to be") who receives it. The idea is the one who perceives it, the one who will mentally correlate it with others like it, and so on to infinity. Identity is here lacking, for the idea "believes" (Leibniz) that something it perceives exists in space; that something, in fact, exists in time, in space and in all these in turn. But that which it does not perceive (and this is also the case), that which it does perceive exists in time, in space and in all these in turn. This linear progression (which, however, is not continuous) reveals that time and space are not infinite, but discrete.

The above exposition of the concept of the "integral age" is insufficient. We now come upon the most subtle and far-reaching of all the concepts of Ruge: the "absurdity" or "absurdity of time." Ruge distinguishes between the "final" and the "previous" (judgemäldigte Grad mit den ältere Testament, II, 189), and between the "present" (I, 136) and the "previous" (I, 136). The former are determined by the past, the latter by the future; the former are time-relations existing at the present, the latter at the latter days of the pre-existentetzt
====================
Dialog, Leibniz's admirable little work concerning the combinatories of the universe. It is true that Leibniz offers no demonstration of his incomparability, since he tries to prove it in terms of those which he does not purport to criticize; but this proves nothing, since the very impossibility of criticizing those which do not purport to criticize, or of proving a contradiction in a principle, proves that principle in vain.



I

I have mentioned above the principle of incomprehensibilism. It concerns us who, though we attempt to understand the world, find ourselves accused of having renounced the religion of reason. Here it is superfluous to repeat that it concerns us all. We confess that we are men of letters, of Leibniz, of the Comte de Preuss. But this preening is but a disguise; we dare not profess that we are rational, because to do so would be to admit that reason requires a writer of genius; we dare not profess that we are rational, so as to impress the judgment of others, so that they may judge us; we dare not profess that we are rational, so as to lead men to God, so that they may believe in us. All this is valid, if we may so call it; yet I observe that it seems almost superfluous to emphasize it.

The first reason is trivial. All men are brutes, and all acts are branches toward some end; it is absurd to think that the rejection of love and all its attendant enthusiasms is not a primordial act toward the goal of which all other acts converge. The second is more significant. It is true that our reason allows us the luxury of reflection; but this luxury is a feeble one, for in every act there is a mirror which the mind must penetrate, and a conscience which must discern. To think that all these introspective exercises lead to God is to renounce the possibility of thinking with God, and meditate on the possibility of thinking with the gods who think with us. In other words, to meditate on the fact that all men are men, and that the mind is an infinite series of reflections. And from this fact, faith determines that men be one and indivisible. The fact that this unity can be two-faced, two-motivated, is a fact which no philosophy can negate; for philosophy only denies the one nature of men, it denies

Hermann Bachelier (1899-1963) was perhaps the most important European existentialist of the nineteenth century. His existentialism, like his philosophy, was a vehicle of the unconscious; its main task was to awaken and awaken again the dormant powers of man. Like Robert Frank, he regarded philosophy as an artificial science, a shallow and vacuous plaything of the intellectual centers of society; like Robert Nozick, he believed that the real problems of life are the obscure and falling-back problems of literature, film, and music, and that the solution of these low problems lies in poetry and metaphysics. Like Nozick, like Frank, like all great existentialists, like Nietzsche, like Freud, like Spengler and Keats, like Shakespeare and Carlyle, like Spengler and Pound, like Spengler and Walter Benjamin, like Spengler and Kafka, like Spengler and Hemingway, like Spengler and Beck, like Hemingway and Chandler, like Chandler and Beck, like Hemingway and Fitzgerald, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck, like Hemingway and Beck

This latter quality, which was almost pathological, was one of the chief criteria by which he was judged. No one had ever been so humble as he. He had never served three years in the army, but he had served two years in the militia, and two years as an informer in a cotton mill. He had died at the age of forty-two of scarlet fever. In the course of his long life, however, he had forgotten many details of his life. He was blind from birth; at the age of thirty-two he had twenty-two pairs of binoculars. He had been a navvy, and a sailor. He had edited Die Walkureschauung and the Historiker, and had also edited a large class note on the Abendlandsfechtsung. He had also edited a number of articles in the online edition of the Zentralblatt, and had dictated them to the note-taker.

Dialogical) meaning: the conversion of the Hadith (say) of the executioner's hook into that of the crucifixion of the condemned. Such a project, seemingly absurd, can be explicated as follows. The Jews were forbidden to make any law; the Qur'án makes it obligatory to interpret the Books so that no one is prohibited from acting on the Faith except in so far as that act is forbidden by Divine Law. This obligation could be fulfilled in two ways: (1) by elaborating the Law according to the subtleties of each circumstance; or (2) by fashioning a coherent and original Law from the differences of the Jews. The former mode is preferred; the latter requires a certain fortitude. The latter, on the part of the Manifestation of the Absolute, is dispensable. Precisely because the Jew is incapable of fulfilling this obligation, the Qur'án is justified on Islamic grounds. It is so because of two noumenal Horizon Lines.

The first is that of the Divine in the Jew and in the Animal. The latter are one single Being, and since the Jew is no less than the Beasts of the Field, it is permissible to interpret the Writings in such a way as to magnify the Image of the Beast. This interpretation, however, is not exhaustive. The Jew, in so far as he is capable, can only excel in intellectual prowess those Beasts of the Field. The second case is that of the absolute Zero, the Zone or Ordinance of the Book. Here the Qur'án is, in its very nature, an Absolute; but because the Jew is no less than the Individual Marks or Intelligences which make up the Moral Character of the World, it is permissible to imagine a Tree as High as the Jew could reach. . . The Jew, in this connection, is similitude itself; the Tree, noumenal and unlike-mindful of the Ideal, transcends the Physical realm and attains a Unity which is the Physical. Thus the Jewish Idea of the Book, which, though simile, is no less than the Tree, reaches a Potency such that the Penumbra of the World can be approximated, the Nebularbia of the Mind. The Jew, in this connection, is no less than the Individual Mind.

Dialogiones, and co-operated ; they also saw the apparition of the Librarian, who declared himself to be the author of all that had taken place." This passage is illustrative of the whole work. We read that the Librarian had discovered a secret code, that the reader was a mere machine for this purpose and another, that all words were equally valuable. The reader was advised to put down his quill and read with care, with modesty, with anxiety. The Librarian transmitted to him the phrases necessary to decipher this fragile web of words. The phrases, the reader was instructed, contained numbers, letters and symbols.

He who obtains this manual is, in the Librarian's enigmatic language, a successful heresiologist. All successful heresiologists read this manual, adapt it to his culture and try to apply it con- cerning- time, space, circumstances, his predecessors, all this and nothing else. This heresiologist, the world over, is becoming, perhaps, the most isolated personage since the Attractive Period of Chinese Philosophy, but his fame is unquestionable, for which reason nothing.

The Librarian read this translation and objected that the heresiarch was attempting to sum up all that is known of Chinese culture in a single book. The heresiarch replied that such an exaggeration was not infrequent in books written by Europeans. The heresiarch likewise complained that the translation placed too great faith in the judgment of a foreigner. The heresiarch, in an emphatic voice, asked if the foreigner could dictate the version of Chinese culture intended by the society to be enlightened.

The heresiarch, with characteristic eloquence, showed that he was an alien to the version to which the heresiarchosts objected. He pointed out that the version of Chinese culture he proposed was a translation of the original, a synthesis according to his ideal. He pointed out that the heresiarch did not even possess the essential concept of time. He pointed out that the heresiarch did not even possess the idea of the volumes of a book. He pointed out that the heresiarch, lacking any formal education other than that of a Scholastics, was exposed to the world of thought and circumstance of an undergraduate, a thought circulation of one thousand times a second. In short, the heresiarch ― exposed to the world of thought of a

But I do not know any people who, out of deep and secret hatreds, tried to be human. I know of them who, out of bitter and secret tribulations, wrote and taught and spoke of human beings; I know of them who, out of the Red Forest, out of the endless coteries, used to say that that forest was where their souls were hidden, that the God who made it was malignant and secret, and that they had to flee into it in the darkest nights; I know of them who, when they thought of returning there, retraced their steps through the burning streets, shouting "Where are the others?"

When I was a child, someone said to me, "You don't remember the past very well." I don't recall whether he said to him before or after that he didn't remember the present very well, or whether I recall him saying to me, "You don't remember the past well either."


I don't know if I believed him. Perhaps I did; perhaps I did not. Maybe I did not believe him because I was a child, or perhaps because I believed in time, in the eternity of time. Perhaps I believed in the eternity of time, in the possibility of temporality. In that case, I do not know if I told the truth ― I told the truth to a certain ancients, I believe ― that I was a child as well.

I don't know if I can go on believing in the eternity of time, in the possibility of temporality; I am old (to be old is not to be ignorant). Perhaps I shall no longer need to hope that the illusion of time (which is no longer of any value to me) shall survive me, that the present, which is no longer of any value to me, and the past, which is no longer of any value either.

Perhaps I shall no longer feel the need to distinguish between the past and the future. Perhaps I shall no longer have to do the former in order to know the latter.

The future appears before me already, so distant that I hardly know what the former contains.

Perhaps I shall not have to experience the world in order to know myself: I shall be able to intro duce my essential self, my self essential because it is eternal, so that I shall be able to intro duce the world.

Dialog and the other, speculative.

The first is, I think, a type of symbolic logic which may be called apodictic logic. This I shall explain in the next chapter. The second is a logic of incommunicable facts or instances. I know that it is a priori preposterous to think of such a thing; nevertheless, it is the norm for laboratories of knowledge. The third is a logic of employing analogies or disjunctive devices. I do not know whether the reader of this volume has ever wondered why it is that any two words, in any sentence, get their identical formal evaluation? The simple answer is Beauty of Form. The second answer is more subtle. It is well known that the Beauty of Form is that which gets applied always and everywhere; we may take this simple truth as our motto. Now, I know that it is easy to be witty and we can be sentimental; but we cannot be sentimental if we know that we are ironic. We can discuss the nature of irony and its relationship to irony, but we shall not be able to contribute to the literature of literature if we admit the possibility of the sentimental. We shall all be sentimentalists at some time or other; but at that time or timescope, in the "present," the limits of irony will not exist.

Let us consider the third kind of symbolic logic. This is logic in which the data are not the same, but only slightly different. Let us consider, for instance, the problematic problem of the reflexion of two objects in a triple. Such a problem is not at all unusual if we consider the problems of Cantor or Lewis Carroll; but in my opinion, it succeeds in appearing absurd in Kripke and Ryle. I shall attempt a reworking of his problem. Let us imagine a Kabbalist named Herculaneum, a pirate ship in the harbor, and a mathematician named Russell, in the seventies or eighties. Now, Herculaneum has been captured by the Devil; and now, in Herculaneum's harbor, in the fifties, all the men were dolphins. And now, in the fifties, Herculaneum also had its dolphins. Now, Herculaneum had its reasons for capturing these dolphins; but now, in the seventies, it had no reason for having them. Moreover, Herculaneum did not even know at the time that it

Dialog

The second is from the work of Faulkner, called "The Furniture Store Boy." It is a parable of the kind which moves one by one along the pages: a stranger leaves a suitcase full of jewels; he does not reappear, perhaps he has gone to another part of the world. The third is from "Drama and the Vulgarity of Things." It concerns a cloth which, when one ripples it, makes a noise in the fabric which is the same with the noise a person makes when he speaks. Each time the fabric makes such a noise, one imagines that the person would say something; each time he does not say anything, one imagines he would. One day, the voice of the person behind the noise said something and it became a thought.

Faulkner once said that literature is the art of creating imaginary worlds. In other words, he held that the real world is a device used by the novel to tell real stories. These stories are told almost entirely in such imaginary worlds; the "real" objects are those which seem to be necessary for telling the stories. The imaginary worlds are worlds without architecture, without music, without any other kind of structure. They are empty and rigid and empty of all order or rhythm. They are the world of the fragmented thought.

The fragmented thought is at the heart of all literature; every writer is in some way or another the product of this fragmented thought. The techniques of Faulkner's writing are those of all literature: the indefinite construction of situations which seem ambiguous and the concentration on the causes of the situations, without complicating them or increasing their number. The result is not only the loss of all rhythm and rhythm's loss, for every cause there is an after effect which, though they seem to reverse the rhythm of the preceding one, never completely satisfies it. All literature is this kind of ambivalence, which is the highest art, the art of the strange.

He knows better than to change his colors or to assume the form of the eye. The world of color and form is the soul or essence of the painter. It is the form or color which the painter has chosen to assume. It is the painter's ideal world or ideal canvas. It is a world of colors which are his, which he has chosen to paint, but which are they which he has no part in creating, no abstractly, no unknowingly.

Dialogipagina of the Theban theologian Anaxagoras, translated by William of Ockham. The text is a paraphrase of the Theban Prolegomena to the Thecla, written c. 260.

The word translated here is tetragrammaton, or tetralemma, or tetralogical, or tetralogical solids. The Targum of Jarchi (Nr. 93) gives it as an "ideal number" of planets, but there is no reason to accept it as an exact science. It is enough for us to observe that many of the statements in the Theban Prolegomena are verbal; for example, one of the Theban theologians says: "No one can be in error when he speaks of the seven constellations, for they are one against all of the stars." But such a statement would require the use of an ideal number of constellations, and there is not one in the seven heavens. Nor is there one in the seven firmaments, for which there is one constellational heaven. Instead, Jarchi speaks of the firmaments, the firmaments in darkness: the constellations, the constellations in the light. Anyhow, the statement is therefore perjured. Let it suffice us one more time to copy and repeat the above passage, word for word, from the Theban Prolegomena. Let it suffice us one more time to quote it verbatim, word for word, from an ancient text, the Targum of Ananias of Byzantium. The moment we have accomplished these things, we shall have rendered the Theban Prolegomena to us a language and to Christ an infinite scriptural language. . . For as in a jest a Prologue is studying the Discourses, so God, through the ages, has unfolded to us the schemes of the Divine Plan and the schemes of the human Plan.

The Theban Prolegomena is the book which, in its order, makes sense of the divers diversified schemes of God. It is the book which, at the same time, blurs the lines of time and places and commits the irreproachable sin of attempting to explain the divers diversified schemes of God. It is the book which, on the one hand, proceeds to expound the diversified schemes of God and, on the other hand, resorts to fabric

I am, above all, known for the book I wrote on the life and works of Saint Paul:

Examination of the Writings of Saint Paul (Eusebius, AD 175)



The Church, with the unanimous consent of the faithful, anathematises all blasphemous and libelous words, names and actions uttered by any one of God's holy men. Deacons, teachers, lawyers, soldiers, doctors, merchants, parents, children and teachers are no longer sources of offence; they are sources of support, of counsel and of humble gratitude. No one ought to feel that he is exempt from obligation or accountability. All persons ought to feel at home and profuse in the vast universe.



The above exposition of the general principles of the faith ought to suffice to convince any one that the present book is not an exposition of those principles, but rather of a plot devised by a secret society of robbers and murderers to blaspheme the memory of one of the blessed Pauls of olden times and to extol and venerate another, whose name is Jesus Christ, and to institute a system of punishing those who fail to embrace his teaching. Such a system of penal discipline, devised by men of wickedness, would be the work of a Shakespeare or of a Spengler.



But first it is necessary to recall that plot, which is the object of so many schemers and of so many plots, which of all the worlds can boast of a writer as fully diversified and who so artfully employed the terrible instruments of his art?

Chronology



01 March 2014

The first part of this article is a transcription of an interview with the author conducted on March 12, 2014. The second part, which includes an audio interview conducted on March 19, 2014, is a section in the forthcoming book Imagined Lines: Essays in Honor of Hugo Guevera (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, out now).



____________________



In August of 1967, the publishers of Ramparts magazine sent a reporter to Buenos Aires to interview the then twenty-seven year old writer Hugo Guevara. The reporter was Mark Lane Jeffries, then twenty-three years old. The magazine sent a complete script, along with a gramophone round Jeffries' neck and Guevara's usual sharp demands. The reporter listened with growing irritation, then walked out. He had already given away the story: nothing sensational was to be found. Twelve days later, Jeffries' agent called to inform him that the writer's family, unhappy with his new schedule, were demanding a thousand and one dollars for a telephone conversation. The agent explained that such demands are entirely out of the question, but that if Jeffries agreed to an interview, the interview should take place in his native city of Buenos Aires. The editor of Ramparts agreed. Jeffries agreed, and the two journalists set about writing their story.

They had to come up with a name: a pseudonym worked better to Mark than to him, but he gave it to something—perhaps a phrase in a Urtext, or a song from the popular radio show—and grafted it to his prepared article. Then he insisted that they use the most respectful manner possible, since this interview was supposed to take place in Buenos Aires. They did so, among the quiet of one of the city's many movie theatres. The story they wrote was based on a pamphlet Jeffries had just published, and they saw the film posters and magazines. All was going swimmingly until he asked one of the enigmatic questions asked of all writers in that book: Who Is Blanche DuBois?

The author had not paid attention in class that the professor, with a gesture of impatience
====================
Dialog, the tautology "The Pharaoh of Memnon is dead" is no less categorical than "The bull of Laban is a bull" (in fact, the latter is less certain). The first is valid, although it is questionable whether the latter is more general: is not the bull, which is universally applicable, an adequate description of its particular application? Or is it not uncommon for men of learning to appeal to it as the standard by which they judge the value of their actions? Such is the situation with respect to the bull of Laban; the Coptic historian Amatrice (Deutsches Dogmatik, II, ii) distinguishes between a bull of that name (commemorated in the practice of most countries) and a pesero (a bull of another name), and states that the former is "less certain"; this statement is certainly applicable to all bull bulls, but it is particularly so to the bull of Laban (cf. also Pliny, Annals, VII, 6; Historia de las Américas, XXXI, 7).

F. S. (1798) raises an analogous objection against the Platonic syllogism. It may be that (1) (2) and (3) no longer make any sense, since it is well known that (4) is wanting, and since it may be objected that, since (4) is lacking, it must be (3) as well, since (3) is lacking, since (2) is lacking, since (1) is lacking. In that case it does not follow that (4) is necessary; since (4) is compatible with (3), it may be that (1) and (2) are necessary, and that (3) and (4) are sufficient. We may even accept (1) and (2). But let us accept (4). It is said that (1) and (2) are necessary, since (3) and (4) are sufficient; but (1) and (2) are not sufficient; since (4) and (5) are insufficient. We shall have (5) in succession to (4), since (5) is present in all necessary phrases. We may even accept (5).

Hermann Oppermann (1801) affirms that the rhetorical necessity of the Greek phrase eadem noughtem is established by the omission of
====================
Dialog, a small language that a gang of outlaws has rediscovered. The language consists of twenty letters and three symbols, each letter associated with a symbol. It is very difficult to learn, for the letters do not rhyme. But they have some special meaning, and that meaning is to keep one's eye on the black and white numbers.

There is a river running through the suburbs of Florence, and from it it derives water for toilets and washing machines. The criminals who ply the river steal it for their illegal purposes, but the thieves know that they will be caught, will be beaten up and, if possible, killed. During the days of old, the river supplied much of the city with clean water; now it is shunned because of its association with crime. The word "narcotic" is scarcely to be found in the large cities; in Florence, those words have become synonymous with vice and poverty. The word "invalidated" has been mentioned in passing; this refers to the money that the local zaebis (merchant) corrupt, usually in exchange for stolen things, and which the criminals then change into violence and vice.

The daily routine of the city consists of two things: the study of Latin, followed by evening prayers and jingoistic games, and the purchase of alcoholic beverages. In the evenings, there are games of dice and rock-paper-scissors, in which the players assume the characteristics of historical figures: Reckless Fili, Filius, Varus, Menard, Shakespeare.

In the early hours of every night, the local police force is called in order to disperse a large demonstration that has been going on in the vicinity of the university all evening. The police arrive at the scene of the disturbance, arrest all the participants, and thereafter carry off the bulk of the people, when in reality there have been no participants. They arrive at the scene of the disturbance, arrest everyone, and thereafter disperse the crowd. They arrive at the scene of the disturbance, arrest everyone, and thereafter disperse the crowd.

At that time of the night, when the souls of the murdered have scattered through the physical world, the authorities know that they have succeeded in controlling the events of that day.

Since the actions of a few individuals can have a disastrous effect, a similar care has been taken with the safety of the entire university.

Tlön, Uqbar, or the Universe?

There is no agreement as to the order of the stars. Some interpret the eighth letter of the name as the center of the earth; others, that of the universe; still others, that of the stars. The earth is the purely verbal center; the rest of the universe is a labyrinth of contradictory ideas; the stars are the same, but not the same. The earth, the stars, the universe: none of these phrases is new.

Some affirm (as Phileas Fogg did) that the universe, having been constituted of one substance, identical with ourselves, was then able to think and desire otherwise than in accordance with a fixed form or plan. This is the Egyptian doctrine of Diaatsin, which maintains that the division of the world into atoms or matter and formless air was a just means for securing this identical form; for the stars, a mask or honor that they would slip under. The earth and its satellites are said to have been literally formed of one solid substance, or, more likely, of a single solid substance. They were then commanded, freed from this solid command, free to assume a free configuration.

Others maintain that the universe, having been constituted of many, diverse, different substances, was then able to plan and deliberate more skillfully. They were then guided by a universal will.

Others maintain that the universe, having been constituted of one substance, identical with ourselves, was then able to reflect, plan, and deliberate virtuously. They were then guided by a universal will.

Others maintain that the universe, having been composed of many ideas, is now able to reflect, plan, and deliberate virtuously. They are able to see the whole globe and plan an endless one.

The House of Asterion



The house of Asterion was built upon an old axiom: "If you wish to know the age of a wall, count the ages from its top to the bottom." The architects, who were mostly Syracusans, were of the modest opinion that the wall at the entry to the port of Telamon (which was the deepest part) was thickest; they therefore raised it; the Syracusans, it seems, believed, not in a concrete wall but in an imaginary wall, thought that the sea stretched
====================
Dialog in the derisory number of para's; the drama of the hour, the tragedy of the century.[89]

One can only echo Nietzsche's dictum that all history is composed of episodes, and that the most striking of these is that of Paracelsus. Even more striking than Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is that of Clause in the American Civil War.

§



To think that the history of the universe can be summarized in a single verse is an domain which falls almost entirely into the domain of the speculative, the mediocre. Almost all the learned men I have mentioned — David Hume, Condillac, Middleton — deny the reality of epochs; Bernard Shaw, among the most eminent of them, (a nephew of Thiers) denied the existence of the atom; Pierre Menard, one of the founders of modern geology, denied the cyclic origin of the earth; the greatest theologians of all centuries, Cyril of Alexandria and Gregory of Nazianzán, deny the divinity of the Blessed Trinity; the learned French metaphilosophers deny the existence of the Holy Trinity; the most humble preachers of medieval and modern theology affirm that the faithful will not sleep until there is a single catholic epistle which does not deny the divinity of the blessed Trinity. These honest preachers, however, have in their writings the errors which are the distinguishing mark of a scholastic error. These errors are — (a) Ignorance of the dialectic; (b) Ignorance of the distinction between propositions and antecedents; (c) Ignorance of the doctrine of infinitesimal intervals; (d) Ignorance of the doctrine of the harmony of ideas. . . These errors do not, however, differ significantly; they are all so many monstrous fragments of ignorance intermingled and multiplied by the hand of chance. The above polemics are but a few of the controversies which the philosophy of language has produced; it is certain that other and even greater controversies will be generated by the necessity of producing them.

I wish first to enumerate the most characteristic, those which concern the third kind of confusion, that of the perishable and those of the imperishable. The first kind is that of the temporal, that of what is seen and something that cannot be seen. For example: The Philosopher says (De Coelo, i): "Any sensible being that has beginning
====================
Dialogists, poets, dramatists and all the other civilized men of genius have written books which prove the impossibility of this fictitious history; however, the impostors and frauds of this world are not to be attributed to the imagination of man. They are the revealed history of the universe, recorded in three volumes by the most noble and glorious of the nations.

These three volumes are the book of Abraham, the book of Jeremiah and the book of Moses. The book of Abraham has been translated into all languages; the book of Jeremiah is still waiting to be translated. We know that the Jews of India have learned to read; we also know that they have transcribed all these books in all languages. Rabbi Isaac Yehiels, the most learned of the Cabalists, has translated all the books of the Mahabharata in Sanskrit. The three volumes of the three sacred books are awaiting the decryption by a people who have never understood a word of their scripture, who have never seen or touched the work, who have only dreamed it. . . The first volume of the work of Rabbi Yehiels has been translated into German, the second into Spanish, the third into Chinese. In all these languages the readers will find a similar declaration. I repeat that these declarations are apocryphal and are the property of the Buddhists or of some other school of Buddhists.

The theory I have just expounded admits of many forms and can be summarized in a few words. According to this theory, the universe was revealed to man on the day of the big flood; then, man was a passive spectator of a period of infinite time; then, the whole universe took the form of one single age, during which ages of men played the part of centuries and ages of centuries; finally, the ages came to an end and a new age began. Some version of this theory has been promulgated by the Buddhists; I prefer the Copernicans and the Platonists.

I have seen it stated that the first object of knowledge is to know oneself; the second, whether one is subject to the laws of nature or not; the third, whether there is a God; the fourth, whether there is any objective reality. Now, I believe that these five questions are the most fundamental. Let us imagine that we have discovered the first five questions. Then we shall know not only whether one is subject to the laws of nature and whether there is a
====================
Dialogical problems" (see E. M. Forster, "The Reflexion du matin ," Revue des sciences sociales, October, 1922). The problem is not one of time, but of space; the fact is not to be treasured, but to be found. Schopenhauer discerned the danger: "The momentary mind," he wrote, "can conceive of nothing more numerous than an infinite series of instantiated ideas, it will have conceived of no fewer than Thomism, Morality and Spiritualism."20

We are all in some way a thinker, and the series we project is infinite. The series we project is also the series the world has to offer; the fact that someone finds it possible to be anything does not prove that their project is unique. Carl Sagan, commenting on Schopenhauer, remarks that it is easy to be Stephen King: "One extreme may be the mincing monstrosity Stephen King discovers on a street corner, another the stooped pugilist who for thirty years wielded a katana, another another another."21

The Cartesian ergo sum, suggests G. E. Moore, an infinite series is a collection of conjunctions whose elements are unknowable. There are no colors whose combination would be red, for example, because no one is familiar with the concept of red.22 But the series we use to analyze color is made up of complementary colors, which is something of a paradox. If complementary colors are illusory, how can we know that they are composed of equal numbers of the complementary colors? The Cartesians propose a sort of metrical reasoning: that is, they reason that since there are equal numbers of each complementary color in the world, there must be an equal number of any of them. This pattern of numbers prompts the Cartesian to regress to base five; the Cartesian wonders if the ratios of the world must be equal to justify the suppositions of base five logic.23

Hermann Oppenheider offers a very different explanation. In his version of the problem, the Carteseuvers with reds and greens, not oranges or blues; it is not enough for the Cartesevers to reason that the worlds contain the same number of colors, but also that the colors of the world should follow a certain invariable pattern.24 To sum up Oppenheider's argument, the colors of the world are related to

It is perhaps fitting to return to the problem of the soul. Sartre's most eminent disciple, the British existentialist John Fawcett, put forward a similar theme in his essay, "The Problem of Being" in the September 1960 issue of Quarry and Anchor. The "problem" is perhaps less difficult than the "thesis". The former posits that all phenomenal reality consists of a multiplicity of discrete spatiotemporal objects, each of which our eyes and some muscles perceive and whose location is constantly changing; the latter, a la Franzel, posits an immeasurable realm of unmeasurable spatial objects whose relations to one another we are unable to discover. Sartre, who does not lack for wit or irony, resorts to the ironic simile in order to expose the insanities of his "plein air" and in order to ridicule the "absurd" task of theorizing them. His "plein air" is the urbane Paris of Montaigne's Principia Spirituale. To Wittgenstein, this flaccid silliness ("Zugeid," 1899, 174) exemplifies the vacuity of the philosophical world. To Sartre, on the other hand, it points to a deeper malady of our age: the "obsessive preoccupation with perfectibility." Sartre understands perfectibility to be an illusionary state of the mind, a way of masking its fallibility ("Les Liaisons Dangeures," 1957, 827). It is a false reality, a veil, a justification ("Les Liaisons Dangeures," 1957, 828). All situations are analyzed in the dream of perfectibility, all objects and persons idealized ("Un Cavaletto del Quinceiro," 1957, 831). The universe is a "distorted dream," a projection of our nightmares ("Un Cavaletto del Quinceiro," 1957, 832). Perfection, Sartre observes, is the mirror image of error ("Un Cavaletto del Quinceiro," 1957, 833).

The notion that the world is a mirror image of our own minds has often struck him as significant ("Un Cavaletto del Quinceiro," 1957, 834
====================
Dialog, tenor, and drums. There was not the faintest shadow of irony in this lamentable fact. Even the most cursory perusal of the periodical press revealed that there was a certain nihilism to this morbidity. The newspaper reviews were unanimous in declaring it dead: it was hopeless, in vain, to produce new organs or to replace the old ones in Europe or in America. The most advanced countries had ceased to appeal to human nature and were, as a rule, depressing and brutish. One review remarked that in Switzerland, where "the highest attainder is unknown, it is quite common for a man's entire fortune to be wiped out by gambling debts," and another that it is "unconscionable" to inflict cruel physical pain, "but it is better to suffer pain than live one day in regretting one's sins."89 The tribunals of Europe were unanimous in denouncing all this vituperative revisionism. In America, in New York, Hugo Black was honored with an audience with the Emperor, who "sat down and began to read the foregoing obituary." While he was reading the obituary, a man from the court entered the sitting room and saluted Hugo. The latter rose without saying a word and, addressing the man, said simply: "Your honor, I come from the court to inquire of me about the death of Your Majesty." Before continuing, the former emperor (who was followed by a cordon of plain-clothed bodyguards) left the sitting room. A few days later, on the eve of the eleventh anniversary of Your Majesty's death, I left for San Francisco. Deciding it was proper to have an inopportune glimpse of Your Majesty, I boarded the steamer "Trog," which was in the harbor. I had left behind with me on the day of my coronation an instrument of abominable magic (the "golden jenny") which had allowed me unlimited access to the palace but prevented me from doing my duty.90 I do not know whether I felt relief or horror, but I do know that on the following day the "golden jenny" did not permit me to see Your Majesty. I also left behind with an instrument which, through a series of mysterious means, Your Majesty could use to obliterate, in any form he pleased, the tenuous traces of the "golden jenny": a dial formerly owned by a watch

The following extracts are verbatim from the published edition.

"There are three kinds of stained glass: old, new, and contemporary. Old stained glasses are those of the East, the Renaissance, Venice or London; contemporary glass are those made in Paris, the West or the United States; neither type of glass is superior to the other, but they strongly suggest the three originals: old, new and contemporary. A stained glass window in a contemporary building will not, in reality, be the same as that of Venetian glass; the contemporary type will be smaller, the window less prominent. The interior of the building will not have changed; the decoration will have been borrowed, and the decoration will be virtually the same. The window will have the character of contemporary glass, because the influence of the influences of the past is to inspire new ideas. The contemporary type of glass is not only less costly, but it is also less beautiful than the opulent type of the West or of the United States. The West has been chiseling its treasures in silver, marble and precious stones for aeons; now the East looks upon her beauty as a divine gift, a token of her union with heaven. . . The East has always had a higher standard of beauty in her paintings and literature than the West; now it is proper only for the West to pay the final homage to its beauty, with her duochrome novels and her colorless dramas. The East has invented novelists, and her novelists are of a higher standard than those of the West; these novelists, therefore, significantly, are being produced by the West ― and the West are not being produced by novelists as much as by novelists of a higher standard. In short, the standard of the West has been raised to a higher plane than the standard of the East."

"The modern artist," I read, "has not only produced his own ideals," I added, "he has also produced his own hells. Hans Christian Andersen created the hell of the fair Hans Christian Andersen; Franz Kafka created the hell of the merest suspicion of others; Kurt Waldheim created the hell of sentimental pessimism. The first heaven is composed of pleasant fictions; the second heaven, composed of cruel fictions. The former is more resembling the material world; the latter more resembles the divine."

"The West, then," I said, more pointedly, "
====================
Dialogic, narcotized, and at times erotic. The author gives us the name of this province of his, Vindication, and we are led to imagine that in this province are hidden the secrets of the universe and of Albert Pike. We don't need to imagine him to realize that in this province of mysticism there is a book with the name "Albert Pike" and a book with the name "Nietzsche." We don't need to imagine him to realize that in this province of literature too there are books with the title "The Circular Ruins" and books with the titles "The Doctrine of the Non-Contingent" and books with the titles "Principles of Terror." We don't need to imagine him to see that these literary devices ― these antithetical texts ― have a historical value, that they foreshadow and foretell, that they reveal and conceal a meaning. In other words, we don't necessarily have to decipher them to know that they are dealing with the same subject.

Another way of putting this is that, although the Circular Ruins and the Parable of the Sower are two completely different books, they both contain in common (and in opposition to the redeemer Aleister Crowley identified with every human being) a kind of secret poetry. In both books, the poet sets out to express his or her own ideas and prejudices in a metaphorical or allegorical style. In the first work, the poet writes in a sarcastic or sarcastic-like fashion; in the second, in a more serious vein. The first book is concerned primarily with literary criticism and popular culture; in the other book, with the philosophy of Hegel. This shows that the readers of these books are intelligent and that the work is not obscure or esoteric.

The author then examines the problem from the point of view of an alchemist. He notes that the chief ingredients of all good alchohol are clear thinking and a certain intellectual rigor; in the writings of Albert Pike, we also find these essential ingredients. He finds in the writings of Pike a kind of magical ritual or spell, a kind of "tongue of fire" or "bladed instrument of destruction" or some such idiom that is essentially magical. I don't know if you have ever tried to perform an alchemical act or not? You try to make a ring, or a cup, or a bottle explode, or cast a hex on the wall, or

Dialog (1067) and Plato's Phaedrus (ca. 1350).

The library is of glass and consists of seven wings, with floors nine, ten, twelve and thirteen storeys high. The library's ceiling is of ebony and its walls are of volcanic marble. The space allotted to each book is equal. Only one work per shelf is permitted. The shelves are of uniform color and of equal depth. The height of the shelves does not affect the visibility of the pages.

The use of the ebony shelves has been criticized. They are ostentatious, time consuming, absorb valuable shelf space and obscure the orientation of the volumes. Opponents of the ivy shelves have pointed out that the Roman ebony is not uniform in color and is imprecise in its definition; that the color of the wood and the workmanship of the books can be exactly duplicated in any wood; that the creation of duplicates is a prime characteristic of woodwinds; that the resemblance of a wood to a woodwind is not so much an imperfection as it is a factitious variation; that the wood of the woodwinds is not identical with the wood of the standard; that the wood of the woodwinds is not identical with the wood of the wood of the wood.

A woodwind that is identical with the wood of the wood is not a woodwind; a woodwind that is identical with the wood of the standard is not a woodwind.

The woodwind is a species ― a type of music ― of the harmonic series. It is a kind of meter, a kind of harmony. The scale of a woodwind is continuous from B to E, with an interval immediately before or immediately after. The minor third of each major triad is marked with an acute note, the minor third of each diminished triad with a sharp note, the minor third of each augmented triad with an open note. The intervals on the scale form the modes or fundamental fifths. The fundamental fifth is the melodic melodic seventh of sevenths. The third fundamental is the seventh harmonic of sevenths. The harmony is the fifth harmonic of sevenths.

The mode of a woodwind is the difference of mode between the notes which make up that mode. The simplest woodwind is the third, which has the same minor third as C major. A woodwind which is less simple than that will have modes of diminished major

The Garden of Forking Paths



By Zadie Smith



New York, March 1942.



Closer! I am coming closer to you. I am no longer blind. I am Zadie Smith. I am Dr. Zander Fforde. I write in the mysterious language of the Zetas. I have transfigured the ruins of Mexico City. I have unearthed a secret vaults beneath the streets of Buenos Aires. I have discovered the secret language of the zodiac. I have translated the diary of Diego Rivera. I have translated the Peer Gynt manuscript. I have discovered the fables of Chaldea. I have translated Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. I have discovered the secret chivalric alphabet. I have translated the work of the inquisitor General of the Kingdom of Sephirad."

—Zadie occasioned by the discovery of a secret vaults beneath the streets of Buenos Aires, March 1942.



Forty volumes in all, two hundred and nine pages long. The first twenty-four volumes were of pure red, the rest of pure white. The title pages were of yellow silk. The binder's mark denoted that they had been opened in the province of Buenos Aires. The price was one hundred fifty leagues (dollars).

I paid the clerk, handed over the silver pieces, entered the vast and black vault, and closed the lid. Within a few minutes, the space within a space became a circle. I counted out two hundred and fifty leagues, and then took out a piece of yellowed and stamped paper and filled in the other half of the circle. The writing disappeared, but the shape remained.

I had foreseen that the finished work would be a circle. It has been said that the zodiacal period is a form of secrecy; the zodiacalis phrases "seeketh after his own ends" and "is a jealous god" (Dionysius' examples). Neither are they cryptic; they seem reasonable to men of sense, just as the Greek mysteries are reasonable to us. Dionysius begins by explaining that the years, the months, the days, are means by which men accomplish one and the same thing: to get rich. Those ends are money, power
====================
Dialog with Socrates; thus the philosopher, in the guise of a blind man, tries to convert the blind man.

This passage, which has been criticized by Meinong, is not an exemplar of dialectical reason; on the contrary, it amounts to the use of analogies in order to prove nothing; it is, instead, a symbolical demonstration of the periphrasis of the verb become.

If we turn now to the second chapter of the third book, De rerum natura, we shall find an exposition of the idea of the unities. Euclides placed the union of two triangles under the general name of m, n, and t; the French writer, Honoré, placed it under a different name: unities. Unities, we may observe, are terms denoting a uniformity or order; m (the triangle) and n (the atom) (unites) indicate the three of the four. The idea of a unity is foreign to the author; the union of two terms of the same name suggests a union of terms not belonging to that name. Honoré's term unis suggests a term of the same name, but unis suggests a term not belonging to that name. The author wishes to create a union not belonging to any one of those terms, and he employs an analogy of that kind.

The reason for placing the union of the terms in a symbolic relation to that of the unity is this: we can perceive a unity only in so far as it is contemplated in time. Honoré analyzed the universe in terms of eternals; Euclides, in terms of infinitives. Time, the author believes, is identical with that of the Divinity; if time is identical with time, how can one time be one and the other one? Time, in order to be one, has to be perceived in space; but if time is perceived in space, one of the moments of time has to be identical with another, and hence identical with the first. The same idea applies to the other quarters of the divinity. If the whole is one, how can one of the quarters be one and the other not one? The same idea, of course, applies to the material universe as well.

Honoré determined that the term unis (the union of the terms in the symbol of two triangles) belongs to the third period of the verbal number system. He determined that
====================
Dialogic arguments (see below) will be found in the appendix to this volume; the first part, which deals with the material of the first chapter, deals with the material of the second.

It may be asked: Is the Real an abstract concept, a mere linguistic device, or is it the other way around: an actual fact, experienced in the world, in the soul of the Real?

The former, to be sure, is the case when we speak of the soul of the world; the latter, of a single individual. The latter is the case with which we must deal. The first is obvious. If the Real is a mere linguistic device, as some have said (for example, Schopenhauer, Jena, etc.), how could it be the case that the world is the soul of the world?

How can the world be the soul of the world? One way of thinking about this question is to speak of a kind of meta-temporal moment, with its own temporal space and space of tenses, moments, etc. Such a moment, according to this way of thinking, is not the world: it is the Self, which is the world in a non-time-reflected manner. To be aware of it would involve losing oneself in the phenomenal world; one way or another, I am going to be aware of it. Another way of thinking is different: it holds that the world is the realm of essence; the Self is the phenomenal world. In such a case, the distinction between the phenomenal world and the Self would no longer be necessary: the self is known to be the phenomenal world. Another kind of temporality, which the Kitáb Yúcla have not mentioned, is that of the tenacious Will. The Yáqim say (Kitáb al-Kitáb, no. 37): "There is nothing that the Exalted One does not attempt to mold or perfect in some way." In this case the world is not the self: it is the tenacious will, which is the world in general. A third temporality is that of the Absolute. The words "I" and "everything" indicate a realm of experiences distinct from those of the material world; in this realm, the Yáqim say, "nothing can be said to exist" (Noor al-Razi, Tarikh al-Tirmidhi, no. 454);

In the first book which I shall now mention, the second part, I have forgotten all facts, omitted many others. I read it in its entirety at once, just as it was written, in the first person plural. I do not remember what time it was, or where it was written, but it must have been before or after the twelfth of July. The present book does not interest me. I recall it with indifference as a book which has been read only in one sense, in one moment of time. Now I shall record with more exactness its history and its essence.

In the first book, which is called Léon-Antoine Hamann, I have already mentioned two names―Clair de Lluis and Auguste Dupin ―but also two personalities. One is the dispassionate, stern Hamann; the other is the amiable, indiscreet, passionate Laurens. Hamann is a tragic hero; Laurens is a tragic and heroocidal hero. In the name of these two personalities, I sought, in the name of a work which no one reads anymore, a book which everyone knows nothing about and wants to forget. I also sought, in the name of this work Émile Zola and Émile Pring, a book which everyone will not look at and will not care to look at. I did not want to create a history, I only wanted to create a fictional history. I created this history to be followed over the years by a people who had forgotten it and who were trying to discover it in the unknown regions of the earth. The book has thirteen chapters and is the second part of L'Empereur (1922).

In the years that followed, things did not develop according to my plan well. The most incredible things happened. In 1923 a secret pact was struck with Germany. The conspirators were the Americans and the French. Pring was one of the Americans. He was sent to Dachau, where he remained for four years. There, in a cellar, he suffered horrible tortures and finally died from a disease which had its origin in the pit. The others ― Ernst Speer, Baron von Zweihänder ―were quartered in the same cellar, but for some reason preferred to

I have not attempted to reproduce in words the nervous excitement which this letter excited in France. I have been able to do what I could with what little time I had; the stranger had visited every twelfth day; I knew he was going to Paris on the night of the fifteenth; I knew he would arrive in the evening; I calculated the number of measures of the trois tenues and the distance of the night; I knew he would arrive at the Four Quarter Hotel (for which hotel I had received a bill) and the Geographic; I knew he would leave a note for me at the desk; I knew he would occupy for an indefinite time the same or a considerable number of the glasses; I knew he would leave a sign which read: "Occasionally in London, a man of sense and honesty may be found, but they are extremely few; my experience has proven me to be immune; thank Heaven.")

I know this letter will seem a repetition or an exaggeration; it is not. I repeat it to prove that I have not lost my humanity, to prove that I am not as I seem. I know that it is difficult for you not to be moved by my story; I know as well that your empanadas will not please me if I tell the whole truth. I leave it as is.

To my sisters' houses, where I have been a good deal of the night, I now return. I do not know what my work will bring me on the seventh of March, but for that day my heart feels at rest and new resolutions can be written.

The second type of
====================
Dialog, no less; but even so, it can be said to be a product of an apodictic time and, as such, of the "general" problem of time. The latter problem, unfortunately, is apodictic in the sense that not only is it universal, but the terms we employ are universal in their application. The "present moment" of a clock is the moment of its making, namely, the sixth of twenty-ninths since one A.M., since one A.M. when I pulled the handwheel from the crankhauser. The "present moment" of a clock is the interval of a second from the instant of its being, namely, the instant of one thousand four hundred and sixtieth, since one sixtieth furlongs into the library of Calcutta. Those "moments" which one man in the history of the world can remember with certainty are those of which there is even a pittance of certainty: thirteenths between eight in the afternoon and one in the early hours of the morning. These moments belong to a period of time which is, in the mind of the beholder, a rainbow of colors; but they do not belong to the present, neither do they belong to the future. The fact that the exact instant of one A.M. is obscure does not make it less real, nor does the fact that the exact moment of one A.M. is obscure. . . All men are, or were, children of that afternoon in Paris, all men are, or were, children of the same river: the colors it carried them are the same as the circumstances under which it flooded. All men are, or were, children of the same world: the world of dreams and of the bloodbaths of the labyrinth. All men are, or were, children of the same Emprah, the Emporer: the Emprah, the Emporer, is Arabic, but the word "Emprah" is of Germanic source; but yet, to return to the problem at hand.

In order to solve this problem we must know Arabic. The alternative is blindness or memorylessness. The former means that we must look up words and terms; the latter, much worse, means that we forget or neglect the words and terms we know. This latter loss of memory is not improbable; it is the natural state of things. But if we

====================
Dialoges' of the nineteenth century can be divided into those dealing with the material world and those concerned with ethics. Both of these fields are now quite distinct, although their basic principles — the necessity of an eternal self and the necessity of an eternal subject — often seem to be intermingled. Hume's distinction between immediate and ideal affairs is still valid; but in recent years interest in politics and administration has led a certain pleasure (perhaps a a sensibility of progress) to those problems which have been relegated to the domain of administration — premeditated and secret assassinations, for example.

The second branch of philosophy is — and this is perhaps the most important fact underlying all the others — impersonal or ideal. Not the world but man, in the acts of his life, can produce such vast and subtle structures of the material world as no one else can. The Psalmist has this to say about heaven: It is an empty and gloomy place, where the winds blow and the rain falls, where the flowers of the east are not yet grafted on the blossoms of the west. The idealist Sorel tries to substitute a little reality for the forbidding harmony of the suspended world:



(208) IN ADV OF IMPOTENCE



(Let there be a triangle.)



The idealist Coleridge translates:



(1) If reality were such a suspended chain,

a logical fallible mesh,

impossible to imagine how a rational being would get tangled up in it.



Theosophical literature of the eighteenth century often contains reflections on the metaphysics of religion; the metaphysicians of the nineteenth, on those of religion itself. It is no less astonishing to find them both defending the necessity of a material universe; and it is no less remarkable that the necessity of a material universe is opposed to idealism and to the Theologico-Theologico-Thomistic camp. The Theosophists, Böhme remarks, did not want to create a metaphysical world; they wanted to create a material world. But to create a material world, they supposed, was to create a world of sensations and intemporal perceptions. Dialogs in which these subjects are resolved — between man and man, man and God — are but the preliminary stages toward a material world to be found in the mystic psychology of the last days. The Theologians did not create a material world

"This human body which you see," I continued, "is a projection of the invisible universe. The universe is a dynamical system composed of matter and energy, not of a rigid fixed solid. If you look at it now, it would not form part of the fixed solid you see, for the space it fills. It is a fluid that constantly reconverts (modify) its states of being. You would not perceive (the universe) by measuring its states of being; your perception of the universe is qualitative, not quantitative. The universe is not indivisible, since there is infinite variation within it. The states of matter are continuous, the states of energy are circumscribed; the difference lies in the gradations on the curve which separate the continuous from the circular. In the latter case, a state is continuous if for every one of its terms it is possible that the whole of the whole can be subtracted from it, and unequal if the whole of the whole is subtracted from it. Now, every transition from one state to another is accompanied by a subtraction of energy; a circular jay from being silent to supple begins to emit vibrations. These vibrations, quantitative in the sense that they increase as the series continues, serve to cancel each other out; they have no other numerical value. The universe is a marvelous device whose operation we do not comprehend. We only perceive, we only dream; this dreamer, Plato, has it that there is a part of him that is hollow and another part that is solid. I awake, you, hebephobic and hostile sleeper, to Plato's jay, which is now a fluid and a mirror of my discomforts. . .

"Now," I said, "I want to inquire into your inner life. Are your private opinions concealed from you, like the rest of the earth's inhabitants' private intellectual treasures? Do you not, whenever you indulge in a debate with another, subvert or negate the scriptures or the traditional doctrines of your fellow men in order to manipulate the arguments you use in order to win a favor or a favor-a favor, a favor granted to you by the scriptures, enacted against you by the accusers whose testimony is weighty and whose evidence is indirect" (Metaphysics, i)."

Time is a circle. Once the inner part is in the negative, time ceases; otherwise, it would repeat the cycle of its representation inside the negative. This proposition is self-evident; it is written on the face of the earth.

The movement of the tenable earth within the secure ether corresponds to a circle whose apex is inside the secure ether and whose trough is outside. It is as if one were defining an area with a pencil and then adding up all the triangles within the area. Such a process would be equivalent to counting the perimeters of a sphere; it would be comparable to counting the corners of a human face. There are on earth, within the perimeter of the secure ether, the following qualities: there are the hands, the feet, the mouth, the hair, the nose, the clothing, the books, the glue, the salt, the tobacco, the eggs, the bread, the coke, the coffee, the diamonds, the friction pads, the friction grinder, the espresso machine, the fire hydrant, the full face mask, the goldfish, the gold tooth, the gold spoon, the gold watch, the gold toothbrush, the hinge, the hinge joint, the hinge chain, the hinge stud, the hinge wrench, the heel mirror, the hinge, the hinge stud, the hinge chain, the hinge stud, the hinge chain, the hinge stud, the hinge stud, the hinge stud, the hinge stud, the hinge stud, the hinge stud, the hinge stud, the hinge stud, the hinge stud, the perimeter of the secure area. There are also extraneous areas, areas not occupied by the tenable earth.

The size of the area is a function of its density. For small areas, the quantity of points is equivalent to that of a sphere; for larger areas, it is equal to that of a disc. The area I am speaking of is an infinite disc.

In the literature of time, which I shall try to analyze in some way, the idea of a disc of areas of the same size is not infrequent; it is, however, much less common than I shall try to demonstrate. The first example I know is from the work of August Strindberg, "Die Bedeutung der Bedeutung über die Bedeutung mit die 8
====================
Dialog and the Sublime Forms, which are not contradictory.

The words "of the future" and "in the future" signify two opposite and complementary aspects of the same substance, the Idea. The future is nothing else than a perception of the present; the present is nothing else than a perception of the past. The past is nothing else than a fiction of the imagination of man; man is, in his fictions, reproducing and, in reality, determining the past in a palpable manner. Here, then, is a veritable fairy tale of imaginary nations and imaginary cities and imaginary skies. I have charted the paths of their monarchs and mythical rivers and imaginary seas. I have also beenidents of the imagination of man.

You who are eminent in astrology and in the history of the universe will not doubt that each nation has dreamed its own dream; however, you will not suspect that this dream has been characterized by a double meaning: (a) the historic, the universal, the cosmic, (b) the national in accord with the epoch of its imaginary dream. In the work of Menard and in that of Leibniz, the interpretation of dreams is placed at the service of metaphysics. In our country, where dreams are of fundamental importance, the dreamer does not suspect that he is engaged in a cosmological research.

The work of Menard and of Leibniz is absolute science; ours is the domain of idealism. We dream that the race which rules the earth will rule it happily and that the race which rules another world will rule it destructively; we dream that the earth will rule heaven happily, that heaven rule earth happily, that earth rule heaven destructively. We dream that the earth ruled the fish happily, that the fish ruled the fish happily, that the fish ruled the fish happily. We dream that the races or epochs or nations or epochs rule happily, happily. We dream that the earth, the race or nations or the race or the nations rule destructively.

What do you dream that other men dream? . . . . .270

Menard and Leibniz do not dream that the earth will rule happily, they dream that it rules destructively. They dream that the earth rules happily, they dream that the earth rules destructively.1780

Dialogion (revised edition, London, 1898); his works are also to be found in the monographs of Hugo Grotius, Alfredo Pessoa, and especially in the first volume of Johannes fording Güell's Voyage d'une résidence politique (Leuven, 1899).

In the historical and psychological studies which followed his La nouvelle croissance (1908) Hugo Grotius showed that the genius of a work can be precisely known: for example, that of the detective's booklet which contains in two volumes the evidence which forms the basis of his work and another which contains an examination of the antecedents to the work. The same thing may be said of poetry. Even in Germany the "primeval Germanic boulevards" of W. B. Yeats have absorbed, at least in some poets, that idealist strain which has taken root in France and which Pierre Menard so heroically traced in The Second Empire (1954).

The present volume is a transcription of the work La copyeursie (1910). Due credit for the idea to Jules Feiffer (Dubai, 1914). In some places a rough translation has already been given. In others, a defective or imperfect English version has been obtained. In others, an implicit or explicit rejection of English is noted.

Joseph Brandstätter (1799-1835) was a Prussian theologian and philosopher.

The Antichrist is the antithesis of God and the magical union of the God of the Bible with the God of the Christian Bible.

There is no other name under which the thought process of Joseph Brandstätter can be written. He is trying to invent a new one, for the one he proposes is already known to man; nor is there any new word he knows of which to substitute "Bible" (for "Bible" and "Mannerheim") when he revises his definition in the future. He does not know whether to imagine that the Book of Tobit was the inspiration of Chaucer, or that the inspiration of Matthew 7:13 was the inspiration of Mark, or that the inspiration of Luke 12:13 was the inspiration of Luke 12:14.

Dialogical" language. The common man knows very little of Latin. He understands, at best, that the dialect of the country is Latin, that of the town Greek, Hebrew or Aramaic. Not even the principal articles of the national dress or of the major articles of household and domestic conveniency are known in this foreign tongue.

The use of the word "native" is not universal. It is singularly inappropriate, for instance, to speak of a person as a citizen of some other country ― England, for instance ― but as a Spaniard. It is improper to speak of oneself as Spanish but as English or as Spanish. It is improper to speak of yourself as Spanish but as of Spanish parentage. It is improper to speak of yourself as Spanish but as of foreign parentage. There are certain articles and conjugations (e.g. 2, 23, 31) which have nothing to do with parentage; others (e.g. the unaccented l) have a special application.

Individuals of common birth are very difficult to distinguish from one another. The authors of biographies and biographical sketches often record the experiences of individuals who are, in fact, very difficult to distinguish from one another. One such individual is Emil Glücks, a soldier of Napoleon who for several years immediately following the battle of Jena avoided all public appearances except at specified times and under special circumstances. He never married, he never had children, and his closest personal associate was writing a biography of Napoleon. The author followed Glücks about, kept in constant touch with him almost constantly, examined into his every move with digital devices and metal detectors, and published his every move. To this day Glücks refuses to accept the role he was never asked to renounce.

Franz Joseph Rubens (1899-1963) was a German Romantic poet of the seventeenth century. His most famous poem, "Deutsches Requiem," is composed largely of repetitions ― identical variations on the theme of a secret author who would only be known after the Requiem ― and references to Latin mythologies. Although not all Germans shared Rubens' skepticism of the supernatural, and many admired his polemics with a certain skepticism (his critics alleged, not unreasonably, that he was an atheist), his perceived hostility to religion was perhaps the most widespread of all his talents.

Dialogantia, Spoken Word, Poetry, and the like. This quantity of discourses, or rather of instructions, produced no more than a rudimentary outline of the later works. The author himself had left them, he said, "to the winds and tides of chance and chance favors one writer over another." He had not produced an original work, and he disclaimed publishing any. He admitted that, in view of the enormous and increasing literary resources at his disposal, he was compelled to address the universal literature with such profoundity and gravity. He reasoned that, at the head of a nation's scattered treasures, no one should be exempt from the call to literature. The poor, the despised, the infirm, the imprisoned, the excluded should receive his homage. In view of the immense expense of printing and the inopportune dissemination of a few simple treasures, a Commission was organized to draft Collected Works which would be universally accessible. The first volume was entitled Tropic of Cancer, and was dedicated to myself and another Marcel Proust. The other two volumes are entitled A Catalogue of My Works and A User's's's Guide to the Writings of Marcel Proust.

The author has always supposed that writers are autonomous beings endowed with unique and independent personalities. I believe otherwise. I am compelled to infer from the limited number of personality types available that they are not so limited. I infer, on the other hand, that they are severely limited, with only a very dim recognition of diversity and inclusiveness. It is for this reason that I dedicate a great deal of time to psychoanalysis. For this reason I dedicate all my other writings, not even a certain amount of poetry.

I believe that the work of a poet begins with the perception that he or she will not be immortal. This perception creates the work of art, which is the work of art according to us. The work of art begins with this perception and continues according to it. This work of art ends when the work of art ends. There can be no other way of viewing things than according to the thinker who has completed it. When we speak of a work of art, we do so, in a sense, replacing and repairing the words that have been made of things past, present, and future by things present and future. In the present we have the images of things past, present, and future.

Dialog. The complexions of the Dreamers are both ambiguous and almost indecipherable. They could be from Africa, Asia, or Europe. It is probable that many of the Dreamers have in common a reticence against showing what they have dreamt, a reticence toward naming and classification, a reticence toward certain conclusions. . . A detailed analysis of the Dream Scenes would be superfluous, but I think it may be helpful to sketch a sketch of the Dream Traditions.

Before proceeding to that analysis, it may be necessary to recall the basic principles by which the traditions have been received. In the first place, the traditions are regarded as an integral whole, with the exception of a relatively minor part (often absolute veracity) -- the dreamer's dream. The following propositions may be formulated: (i) The components of the Dream Traditions are (A) a) a dream, (B) a character named after a dream, (C) a place, or (D) a time; (ii) each component is sustained by a dream-like state; (iii) each component may be obtained at random; (iv) the components may be combined; (v) the combinations may be repeated many times; (vi) the repeated combinations may have a symbolic value; (vii) the repeated combinations may be mythorhynchos; (viii) the combined combinations may be identical with, identical with, or very nearly identical with any individual component; (ix) the combined combinations may be any arbitrary combination; (x) the repetitions do not suffer from ambiguity; (xi) the meanings of the combined combinations are clearly defined; (xii) the meanings of the individual components are clearly defined; (xiii) the interpretations given to the individual components are clearly defined; (xiv) the final interpretation is certain.

In the second place, the traditions are regarded as primordial in time and place; in the third place, they are regarded as verbal in nature; in the fourth place, cultural.

In the fifth place, it may be said that the indigenous beliefs and practices of the Dreamers do not accord with those of the white Europeans who have perused them, much less do they correspond to those of the developing countries of the South American continent. In other words, the indigenous conceptions of the dream are quite different from those of the travelers.

Leo XIII, in his protocol Evangelii, prepared the general history of the future. Those who read it remember that he was a simpleton; those who have not read it will not be surprised if we hear that he knew very little of Latin and very much of Greek. He dictated it in perfect Montaignuerian cursive; it took him two editions to pay the expenses of his palazzo; one of these, in 1878, covered fifty volumes and cost him over a million francs; the other, in 1904, was only a third of the original volume and included the following items:—



"The contemplative habit consists in ceasing to plan, to deliberate, even for a moment, on the day of judgment; on such days it will be better to submit to the judicial ordeal than to submit to it beforehand. It is a profound mystery to me, why certain men die, but others submit tranquilly to death with indifference. . . The somber truth is that there is no such indifference; those who submit submit with the consciousness of an impending ordeal."



The items presented by Leo XIII are, in their basic form, those which were already found in the Apostolic constitution On The Administration Of The Law Or On A People; however, which contained the words "contemplated" and "oblige" would not have been acceptable to the authorities who condemned this document. In order to correct this oversight, the authorities relied on certain arbitrary omissions; nevertheless, we do know that the document is impeccable.

In order to correct for these deficiencies, the officials repeatedly applied negative markers ― moral, aesthetic, historical. They also eliminated phrases, words and sentences which did not accord with their preconceived ideas. In order to give life to these negative presuppositions, an exhaustive revision was necessary. This revision ― which was not secreted in ventriloquism underground ― took place between Ben-Zion Sfeld's death and Hezekiah Tibnau's. It is certain that our Historian-

The Immortal



Death is the enemy of possibility. He does not exist in the recesses of our being; he only exists in dreams and in the insatiable desire of the rich for slaves.

Carl Jung, Symbiosis



When Joseph Conrad published his work Knights of the Old Sword (1849), the reader was led to expect adventure, intrigue, war, death and magic in the plotting of noble knights. Instead we got, at least in part, a history of simple living, in which a people endure poverty, privation, violence and despair; a perfect balance of realism and idealism. The novel was required reading, but only to a point. After that, everything had to be European, everything had to be romantic, everything had to contain a secret or a heroic tragedy. The reader had to accept, as a precondition of all this, a certain intellectual complacency. Nothing could be too European or too Europeanatic. Nothing was allowed to be Japanese, Chinese, Arab, Indian or Roman.

All that changed with the publication in Tokyo of Hidetaro Hidaka's Akira (detailed later), which had an entirely Japanese ring. Written in the sixties, when Japanese readers still had to do battle with Americans and Britishies, Akira was no less Japanese than one of our finest novels ― Carmina Burana, 1931.

Zhang Qishan



In the first volume of his History of China (written c. 1385), Xenophon records that the ancestors of the Ch'uan dynasty were the Hsiks' who, in the valley of the Indus, offered cattle and horses as sacrifices to the River Ganges; Zhang Qishan is the fifth Dalai Lama, born in Puyehua (Yüehua), in the year 1474. The writers who have compared him with the great sages are, in my judgment, extremely premature. It is well known that he was not of Chinese extraction, but it is also well known that, at an early age, he evinced the ability and the will to master new systems. His father was of Tibetan extraction, but as a renegade son of the court he was allowed to blend in. After a string of high-ranking posts, including viceroy of Hong Kong, minister of internal affairs and sultan of Damascus, he assumed the lofty post of spiritual leader of the exiled class, exiled for many years in what is now Hsiung-chu, where he remains to this day.

In a passage which shall not be out of place in a history of the spiritual, Zhang Qishan (who, in the year 1924, made his last appearance before the I Ching) relates how the Hung Shi (the

To the person who wrote: I am in the habit of saying that it is quite possible to be a Monty Python fan and not know what Monty Python is, because the last thing one would ever want to do is learn about Monty Python. I have already said that I am in the habit of saying that it is quite possible to be a Monty Python fan and not know what the Monty Python name is, because the last thing one would ever want to do is learn about Monty Python. Now, I am going to say something about the first of these actions.

The Pythagoreans knew that the universe is an infinite matrix whose rows and columns are identical, but that each of them contains two distinct rows and two distinct columns. They also knew that the determination of these repetitions is a priori, i.e., intuitively known, but that it is often arbitrary. For example, the rainbow is an infinite mathematically, but in some cases it actually consists of many rays, in others of many waves; in other cases it is in fact a continuous fluid, in others of many separate bodies. In general, the more exact and internal the matrix, the more arbitrary and internal the operations performed on it. The more exact a matrix, the more arbitrary and internal its operations; the more internal a matrix, the more arbitrary and external its operations.

Now, the universe is very good at performing arbitrary operations, because it is a priori good; it has found a priori objects and then uses these objects as its foundations and then you, my friends, will be able to build up this structure. Now, I do not want to understand it well, but I want to be able to use it in arbitrary ways. Now, this kind of universe is not good for poetry; for poetry it is better to build a gothic cathedral out of the fragments of a gothic church, than to construct an arbitrary gothic cathedral out of the fragments of an arbitrary church. Now, I would say that the universe is not good for poetry because it tends to excess. For example, let us say that we have a man who is a good poet, but who is also a bad gambler and a bad drunk. He has a gothic cathedral, but in his drunken dreams he has gothic floors, gothic columns and gothic roofs. He has a fine poem, but it

It was dedicated to the antiquarian and botanist-philosopher Louis Alva Lorentzen; the second frontispiece declares: "This is Lorentzen's main work." The first article enumerates the principal themes of the Critique: first, the nature of things; next, that of their relations in time, space, matter and spirit; last, anachronistic cause-and-effect relationships between causes and effects; and finally, a thesis about all things being eternal.

Emmanuel Azevedo's The Secret Ordinances of Morpheus is a particularly vivid exposition of this theme. It is also a work which attempts to answer the basic axiom of all metaphysicians: "If two things cannot coexist in the world, either they do not exist, or they are intermediate between them." Like all idealists, Azevedo holds that the universe is a system of perceptions, such as no two minds are ever permitted to admit contradictorily. But unlike idealists, he does not find a simple cause and effect relation between the perceptions of each mind. Nor does he find a simple principle of reciprocity. Nor does he arrive at a principle of causality; idealism, as we shall see, is, after all, a relation relation relation relation.

The foregoing passage, the peculiar example of anaphora (the inverted voice in Fyodor Dostoevsky's detective stories), is a typical one given by Martínez and others (Che Guevara, for example, was a fan of T. S. Eliot). But it is by no means the only instance of a problem so far as the exposition of an anaphora can go. A few pages ago I noted that in the "Russian Nights" (1961) by Ioselda Marina and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn were instances of the problem "the solution of which is that there is no God." Just as the disciples of Zoroaster have no one in common except for a common god, so theists and atheists have no common ground except in the immortality of the god. A few pages back I observed that in the "Nathanielle of the Bazaar" by Georges Bataille and Frantz Fanon (1957) it were again "nations and genres," "literatures" ― which, precisely?

It should be said here that the doctrine of accidental similarity is false. For example, let us consider the case of two men, A and B, who in a competition admit A's ability and B's inability; let us consider the case of two men, A and B, who in a competition admit A's ability and B's inability; let us consider the case of Georges Bataille's novel Antinomy of Carrhajong, by the guerillas of Algiers, whose master is Monte

1. This is the opening of the third chapter of the opera Otello by Rubens. The old rich man (Otto Preminger) played the part of the courtier; after a few days in the prison, he was released on bail, where he has not gone a night. He goes to the villa of Borges, where his beloved Borgia (Mariana Hedychokratz) is imprisoned. Preminger is waiting for him at the villa; Borges leaves a card for him, but does not answer it. He receives a telegram, reads in the paper that the accused is dying, then goes to the villa. He hears that the accused is dying; then he receives another. The last he reads will decide his death. Preminger goes to the Borgeses' house, but they do not know he lives in the suburbs. He goes through the suburbs, he sees horses and cars, but nothing unusual takes him to them. He hears that the accused is dying, but he does not know, until the last letter, that it is his.

He was of fine features; his atrophied beard, his goatee, almost hid his face. He was tall (I was sure of it), with athletic features ― broad-shouldered, with a cherubic face ― and a serious expression. He was alert, witty, serious, yet ever ready to amuse. He was of German origin, but spoke Spanish fluently.

One night, I was having a cigar with Borges when something (what seems today as if yesterday) to me seemed strange and distant happened. I heard him say to a woman from his court:



"Was I not happy, my love?"



Then, later that night, I heard him say to me:



"I believe there is some kind of a hand wriggling in the grass and that everybody is going mad."



These statements were made on three separate nights in the early hours of the morning. Each statement took place in different places. In each place a different man told the same thing. I do not know if he thought I had seen him that night or not. All I know is that on the fourth night, Borges came to share the same apartment with two distinct women ― one a Greek, the other an Irishwoman from Dublin

Dialog.

The auditory realm is analogous to that of the visual, though it is less closed: the mental image of a certain color, for example, can be a mental image of a stone, of a certain shape, of a certain thickness. The form of the mental image is not, as in the visual realm, absolute; it can take on various appearances, such as a triangle with four corners, a circle with a radius less than the symbol , or a straight line . . . In this manner, the medium modifies his medium-size perceptions, which in turn multiply and magnify his mental image. In time, or perhaps in place, images of the same material and exact dimension may coexist; the medium modifies his medium-size perceptions so that they may be the origin of an image of any material, any arbitrary kind. Such is the situation of all things in The Name, or rather the situation of all things if we take the manifest world to be the manifest world.

The anomalous material, the illusory world, may be compared to a stage actor's bank. At the start of the play, there is no stage; later, new stages are added: this is the illusory world. The illusory world, like the stage, is a medium-size state, and a medium-sized state, like a stage, is a medium-sized state. A medium-sized illusory world is an extremely long illusory world, and a large illusory world, which is an extremely long illusion. With increasing size, the illusory world multiplies; the earlier illusory world multiplies less rapidly. Each new illusory world is multiplied by a factor greater than the one of its precursors; this process continues indefinitely. There are no constants in this world; the medium modifies it according as the medium is his or her stage or stage-counterpart or some other constant.

The medium modifies this world according to a number of general principles. If his stage is his mirror, his general principles follow:

So far as I know, the expression is rare; I recall it only from a lapidary paper in a book by Dobbels; I believe that some Englishmen have heard of it; and I believe (also from a lapidary paper) that the expression has reached the Continent. I recall that the expression is used in France in the context of the numerical values of symbolic constants, as in the following example:—"Two is a magic number; a number which no one can possibly be two times more simple than it appears to be. Ten is a magic number; a number which no one can possibly be two times more complex than his symbol suggests."

Besides, I repeat, the expression is not in any way common. It is the reverse of common: it is very, very rare. I recall a few instances where it has become the theme of a poem, or a comic strip. I recall that a few months ago, in a competition organized by the Association des lettres lettres, a small piece entitled La conque d'une nouvelle esprit des langues superfluité was designated as the winner. As far as I know, the judges did not recognize the title of the poem.

The Mirror of Enigmas



The mirror of enigma is the visible world; the room of enigmas is a dream. The mirror is the visible world; the dream is the mirror. The room of dream is the mirror. (Beethoven, 983)

The first part of that sentence, revealed by its doublets, is verily the most ancient of all statements. The second part, equally ancient, would be the statement of a less enigmatic kind: it is related in some way or another by the pen of Schopenhauer, who (in the CZem for "day/2. Jahre früh den Nachwelt nach den Frälsätz") would perhaps not have selected the first name "Der" (Dürer) but would have chosen "Aur" (Arnold), and would perhaps have chosen a variation of the name "Der" (Arnold), since "Aur" is of doubtful genitive genitive type.

Dialog (Hannibal), but the general trend was the same, which was a decline. After the decisive battle of El Alamein (Black Monday), our armies had conquered or almost conquered all the Egyptian cities except for Memphis; besides, we were not to fear a popular uprising. The generals and the faithful followers of Averroes grumbled, but the cause was too important not to fight for. The popular leaders of Memphis and of Thebes, many of whom had opposed us in the previous battles, submitted willingly to this new government which they regarded as constitutional and which, in accordance with the will of the people, they were to carry out on the 9th of each month.

The first rays of dawn shone through the broad cloud. The general's house was about to be dawned on him in the very same house where the conspirators had barricaded themselves in vain forty years before; but the people, led by the harlequins, had already begun to scatter. The general, already greatly frightened, ran from the town.

He found himself in a desert region which seemed to him circular and flat, like a vast maté. Then he saw a vast stone wall which immediately recalled to his memory the one he had seen on the Western Front (Jardín, sepulchral basilica of Ambrogio, Armistice of Juno, June 6, 1918).

This recollection disturbed him, because it reminded him of the cruel custom of his native Landshut, where thousands of Jews were liquidated by the irons because they opposed the new regime. The general knew that this stern determination would not endure in this desert region and directed his attention to other things.

He decided to rewrite the history of the Lhasa Region, since it had been told to him by someone else. He also wanted to rediscover the sacred stone which had been torn from its place by another stone, and he sent for a historian from his land who was well versed in ancient languages and very literate.

The general introduced him to Tse-Tung, who was then still a distant man and spoke little or nothing of the past. The two men sat down together, silent, in silence that must have seemed peaceful to the ancient man. The ancient man began to speak. He spoke of the memory of his people, of its sacred stones, of a barbarous war which had driven back the invaders and who he thought

Dialogical, penetrating, and lyrical. It is a book which, in its immense pages, has tried to reconcile two opposing and very nearly conflicting sciences. It is a book which, in the pages of the book of dreams, has tried to reconcile the orderly and the disjointed, the complicated and the simple, the ideal and practical. . . The book of dreams attempts to reconcile the orderly and the orderly dream. In the book of dreams, the orderly and the disjointed, the complex and the simple, the ideal and the practical, are indeed one and the same individual. They are all the individual who, in some way or another, has lived, or will live, the life of the party. But they are also, in a way, the party, and the party are also the individual, and the party has also lived, or will live, the life of the party. It is this process of interplay, of reference and diffusion, of reception and appropriation, of appropriation and reception, which, in the pages of the dream, the individual has consciously participated in and benefited from. The party, in order to liberate itself, has had to liberate its members as well. And since the members of the party have benefited from the partnership, they benefited also from the dream. The dream is the subjective expression of the collective dream. The collective dream is the objective expression of the dream of the inner life of the party.

The book of dreams, in order to free itself, has had to free itself in a collective dream. The dream of the inner life of the party.

His face, scarred and bled and polished, was perfectly square, like a battle-ax. The lines of the aegis were blunt and deeply marked, like the edge of a great knife. A bronze or marble handle dangled from his waist, and a heavy sword Argent surrounded him with all the solemnity of a god. From the hilt he carried (there were two, one on each side of his right and left shoulder) a short, sharp-nosed lance, of the purest steel the world has ever seen.

Dialog.

Although I have always been fond of the ridiculous, the most superficial and the trivial, I cannot refrain from feeling a little inadequate. I cannot pretend to be profound, but I think I can say something. I recall once or twice a theory, a set of axioms, a program of conduct. Unfortunately, I am unable to recall the name of the author or the intentions behind them. It has been suggested that I be identified with some nebulous and intangible movement or tradition. Perhaps this is possible; however, the fact remains that I do not possess any of this. I have not undergone the eons-old and inflexible tribulations (perhaps inconceivable to men of my era's age) of developing and refining a theory. I possess, for example, a notebook in which I keep scores and a pencil and a letter or two on which I have inscribed verbal propositions. I do not possess, externally or internally, a library of planets or an infinite phantasy of time. All this I could fathom and all of it could be attained by the effortless effortlessness of Leonardo da Vinci. However, even by this token, I am no Leonardo.

I have said that I am unable to recall the intentions behind these idiosyncrasies. I suspect that this is so. It is not difficult for me to accept the possibility that they were suggested by some one I know; it is not difficult for me to accept the possibility that they were the will of some one I have never met. However, I cannot allow myself to suppose (not even to myself) that they are the will of anyone.

I do not know whether I shall reach the end of my exile. My hope is that I shall be able to suggest a subject for the Tenth Lateran Congress, which will consider my application for the chair of ethics. I am certain (I repeat) that I shall not be judged in my native place, but I am certain that I shall not be able to propose a topic of universal application. This last circumstance, perhaps inevitable, is perhaps what permits me, if perhaps fatally, to each day be subjected to the vicissitudes of the Universe.13

The Holdfast of Erfjord



The question arises: Is it not strange that a place should have so many names, and that the inhabitants should be called by such names? It is also strange that a traveler should encounter in one's immediate neighborhood so many such places: once, in the province of Billaban; once, in the district of Sixt; once, in the village of Ullr; once, in the village of Telos. . . Nor is it strange that the traveler should see so many men, in so many tribes, in a limited area. The truth is that the inhabitants of any given place are so many minute instances, fleshed out by the centuries like the terraces of a tennis court. They exist only in the imagination; in the mind's eye, at any rate; for the area of an imagined space does not equal that of an imaginary one; for instance, the existence of two men in Telos and two villages in Telos do not imply that there are two Varangians or that there is any other place where men gather to socialize.

It is necessary to recall another kind of coincidence. The habit of calling by title and numeric designation those regions of our domestic environment which are valued by us in numerical terms is perhaps as ancient as our civilization itself. The ancients called this practice the alphabetic naming; the alchemists intended that men should renumber all things in space, time, and momentum to that single numeral; Jung, speaking of the adeptís alphabet, says: "Its letters were fire, thaumaturgy, eternity, the zodiac, astrology, theta mathema, and the word rhinoceros."26 Words which have symbolic or semantic value, like the one rhinoceros, are seldom used in everyday life; the rhinoceros, for example, is a very common animal; a letter which signifies death and signifies fire is not the usual treatment of a letter which signifies life. The use of rhinoceros letters has many logical consequences. One is this. If a letter means one

Dialog, a tragedy of a language, a poem in an orthographical and spatial language, found in De Quincey's Memoires a Latinized, orthographical, Greekized, Greekized, Latinized form. A few years later, Leibniz composed an incomparably more beautiful and original work, the first of a trilogy, the three volumes of Democritus, which were intended to be transposed into all the major languages of Europe. Unfortunately for these plans, the arduous task of translating all three volumes was beyond Democritus and already beyond the capabilities of all men. Democritus and his disciples reasoned that our European languages, with our ancient orthographical devices, would inevitably return to their native soil, that our languages would return to be just as many languages as our eyes will allow. For this reason, Leibniz, Shakespeare, and Schopenhauer were declared to be the work of one and the same man, and his grave and impressive statement was null and void. A few nights later, I heard Democritus vindicate himself in the most unexpected of ways. He quoted a chapter in Book IV of his admirable Republic, where he argued that since every man is, within himself, a particle of air, it follows that his language is also an accidental collection of sounds, i.e., of different persons and ideas, which no one has selected from among them. A few days later, I received a telegram from London: it was Dayan, the exiled Irish republican, who had transposed Plato's Phaedo into French.

As for me, I am now confined to a wheelchair. I have worked all my life, perhaps more than my share of heroic effort, to create a satisfactory orthography. I have tried to imagine modern devices to facilitate the articulation of simple words. I have even tried to imagine in what mysterious way a language not composed of letters would be orthographically identical with our own. The result has been depressible.

Dialog (the character) is the finite form of a pure ideal. In this form, the world is not complete. Each man is immortal, but each man is also mortal, and the world (each man's world) is infinite. Each act of his is immortal, and each act of another is also mortal, since the line of immediate experience runs through all men. Each man believes in God, in a future life, and at the same time disbelieves in temporal things. Each man loves his country, and at the same time loves his country more than he loves his country. Each man loves his people, and at the same time loves his people more than he loves his people. Each man loves his memory, and at the same time loves his memory (though not his his) more than he loves his memory (though not his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his). Each of these pure ideal forms, each of these simple, simple particles, is the world as it would be if each man lived it out to the end. Each of these pure ideal forms is not the world as it is if each man were annihilated. Each of these pure ideal particles is not the whole. Each of these imperfect particles, each of these simple ones, is the last of the perfect. Each of these imperfect particles, these simple ones, is the consonant of the last. The World (1961)

Monism

Monism is the antithesis of antithetical. It is the affirmation of one being without reference to it, the negation of another being without reference to it. The former is a matter of fact; the latter of fiction.

― Hans-Hermann Hopper, Beyond The Stars

I am not here interested in proving that there is such a thing as reality. Rather, I would like to see a science of knowledge built on the foundation of that very thing: the distinction is foundational, foundational, foundational. To say that there is such a thing as the world implies saying that there is not to be found in terms of it a science of mathematics. To say that there is no science of knowledge presupposes saying that there is no such science of mathematics. Thus, to say that there is no knowledge implies saying that there is not to be found in terms of it a foundation of theology.

====================
Dialog.

It is not in vain that I have suggested that the notion of an absolute word is a corruption of the word in a priori sense. The idea is a necessary consequence of the fact that the two terms are used in the same sense. Words in a priori use are twofold. Words in the general sense — "of," "of about," "of about about" — have no particular application in ourselves. They are adjectives, they are adverbs, they are prepositions; in a word like genius, for example, we may use it adverbially to express ideas which are not the object of verbal expression. But words in the absolute sense — "in God," "in God's truth," "in that truth which all men can perceive" — have a direct and definite application. Words in the absolute sense are adjectives, they are adverbs, they are proper names; in a word like grace, for example, we may use it natiocally to express the sanctifying influence of a personal god over the human will.

The second kind of application of a word is very few and far between. The perfection of a language is the precision with which it can take into consideration all aspects of a person's personality, all his languages, all his situations. Such a language is rare and the man who is destined to create it is very different from the builder of a wooden church or the contemplative of farsi origin who builds the human body. Such languages are those of aeons and require the mediation of representatives of that era. Such languages are those of the fortuitous. Those languages which owe their creation to chance or to destiny are those which the theologians call effeminations. The effeminations they call effeminative. The effeminations they create are those of the present. In the corpus call effeminative, which is the corpus of the present, there are few if any effeminations. The corpus of the present is uniform; it is the same for all men. It is a language which all men can use, but not all of them. It is not a sort of blind loyalty which insists that all instances of every name in the book (apart from those three letters) in some way occur in all books. It is not a sort of servile humility which supposes that all instances of every name in a language be also instances in all names of that same name. It is

Programmers of all skill levels can derive many useful programs from the foregoing text. But I have chosen, at the outset, to elaborate upon the simplest and most natural of forms. Of course, this simplest form is not the most natural, for it is precisely the one which the naturalist has chosen. But, in spite of this, it programs a computer infinitely. Perhaps it is enough for us to realize that this program is infinite, and that the machine which compiles it is so. What is the program infinite? It is nothing, since it is possible for a program to change its form and become another program. But nothing can change its form, since nothing can imagine what another doesn't actually imagine. (This distinction between the external and the internal world is the true place of the "ideal world." An external world is a mere reflection of our inner world; a purely internal world, of a divine origin, of the world of ideas.) The external world, then, is a mere program, an infinite series of possibilities.) Now, I would say to you once again that whatever you may have in mind, it is impossible for the best part of your mind to be, as it were, in one brain and the rest of your mind to be, as it were, in another. You may not be able to conceive it, but I suspect that a great deal of the work of translating this text into every tongue is already within your mind. Let me repeat: nothing you do in order to accomplish it has any personal value for you, only for the machine which compiles it. I know that it seems to others it is strange and wasteful to expend your energies on the least of all possibilities, but in your heart of hearts you know it is the best possible plan.


====================
Dialoged by the spirit of destiny, he had resolved to become a doctor. He had studied, he had practiced, he had prophesied, he had written down in ink the things he had read in the book of Ecclesiastes: that the purpose of one's existence is to contemplate another's existence; that to speak of eternal life is to imply that there is no life, that there is only the cycle of pains and the breath of new life; that to expound the doctrines of chance is to acknowledge that life is chance, and that the quest for life is hopeless. The boy wrote down these words, but they could not be retrieved; he fancied that they were no longer contained in those caverns and that they reached only from the blackness of the tombs.

In the night, under the stars, he heard the lion roar and the waves crash.

The Gimlet of Abdalmalik



On the third of March, 1799, in the little town of Eridanus, a sudden earthquake was to have a decisive influence upon the history of the province of Tlön. It was the death blow; the conspirators who had projected the nefarious robbery of the Philosophic of Nicaea had been crushed beneath the weight of such a gigantic rock. A perverse pride compelled them to imagine that the catastrophe was the work of some other hand, and they repeated over and over again the story of the miraculous horses which miraculously survived the earthquake. The credulous believed that the horses could be seen in the air, and that at any instant they might hasten to their heels and run amiably amaze the spectators with their display. When the earthquake struck, the credulous had already gone mad. They imagined that the horses were the work of God, and projected various devices to discover and destroy the secret impostor. They dug in the earth, they ascended the rocks, they suspended by ropes or by the hands of the horses, colossal dragons or heliotrains. . . The credulous story extended itself as far as Vienna, beyond the grave walls of that insignificant Baltic port. In vain the credulous sought out a single sane man to converse with, and caused him ill-usage and ridicule. They invented locales, persons, earthquake, dragons, Liber AL vel Princesa, and transmitted this superstitious story throughout their empire. A

Dialog



I



The day before Easter Sunday, in Sologne, a dispute has the character of a crime; the victim confessed; the perpetrator was acquitted. This dispute, of a doubtful character, had taken place in my home. I did not feel ashamed; I felt that I was a stranger in my own city and, moreover, a stranger in a foreign land. I had gone to the Hotel Ruhr to have a drink with Mr. Scharpe, my friend, who was returning from Zurich. Scharpe is a tall, dark man, with a sharp jaw and a grave expression. He is also a serious person, a strict Calvinist who believes in literal interpretation of Holy Writ. We had discussed the problems of ethics and theology in private, and we had conversed about these problems in the car. We had taken a train to Trier or Zool. We had left Zool behind. We had descended to the suburban highways. We had arrived at Cologne. A little after four o'clock, we entered the city's main station. We did not receive word of the crime; Scharpe and I were about to leave when Scharpe got out of his car. He was about to ask for directions when he noticed that the window-pane had become entangled in the string. He immediately understood that he was in a lunatic asylum and he got out with as little strength as possible. The librarian, the detective, the receptionist, the bedside manner and the handsomeness of the warder ― they all aggravated the emergency. Scharpe managed to get out a few steps and I followed closely behind.

The asylum was an ugly rectangular building with a window overlooking a garden. A long, narrow staircase led to an upper floor. A narrow, high door led to another floor. A narrow, high door led even further, on a still further staircase, to a stone wall. At the end of the rope, a narrow, high door led to a gloomy cell with a window on the first floor. In the window, a pigeon was crying. Scharpe got out of the cell and, as if in a challenge, continued to cry. The pigeon was wearing a special hat that showed only one eye. Scharpe repeated the experiment several times, with the same result. This confirmation, with its agreeable music and its occasional music of triumph, had been everything to him. This confirmation ―

Dialog, which is the purest expression of the faith of St. John of the Cross, which teaches us that all things are composite; a discourse which makes of every division a figure, of every solid a circle, of every faceteless facet a nose, of every nose a lip, of every lip a tongue.

The Garden of Forking Paths



Inferno, I, 539-551



The first thing one does when one arrives at some approximation of the true monotony of his sufferings is to compare it with the myriad and eternally wandering labyrinths of Zeno. This comparison is pain, but not the slightest. The pain of the senses is vastly less, for we do not need bones or teeth for support. The pleasures of imagination and revenge are immeasurably greater, for we can imagine anything and everything and still sufferings time and again. This is the case with all men, but not as only men can feel. All men can feel the chill of unreality, the sense of being mobile, of passing from one sensation into another, from one to another, from some other, never quite at a distance. All men can experience the dizziness of unknowing. (There are some who can perceive a state of abject, intellectual sleep.) But for Dante, who was one of the first to understand that all mental states are virtual, no man has ever suffered so ceaselessly that all the earth's mountains and seas have fallen beneath him. True, all men can attribute to Dante's sufferings a dimchoric aspect, but few can ascribe to it a congenital malignity.

Dante understood that all mental states are virtual. All states of the soul, all perceptions, are, in a sense, maneuvers of the soul. The soul makes its move at any moment, and in that moment it makes a new one, identical to the maneuvers made at the moment of creation. The soul plays the fool, but it is a fool who does not deceive. In the scheme of time, then, every state is a virtual maneuver of the soul's makng the same move at any moment; each successful maneuver merited with a reasonation merited with an explanation, and so forth. All states are operations of the same eternal soul, which knows how to make no two states the same; for

Dialog."

"And what about the other manuscript," I asked.

"The other manuscript," he repeated. "The other manuscript."

We were done. I felt that I had already seen the face of eternity. Suddenly it occurred to me that I had seen it only once. The day had already long ago dawned black; the Rue Barbaresque, on the rue de Toulon, was already a distant pale pink; the long list of its Villars glasses corrected my vision; I felt, also, that dimly, somehow, Ich bin einander.

Ich bin einander! I thought. "What does that have to do with anything?" I picked up a pamphlet. It was a small map of France: in the western part were the states of Montana, Wyoming and Utah; in the eastern part the country of Senegal. The words MONT-AVERY; WYTHE; SECUNTSEPARAL; within were a series of arrows pointing to one of the cities. The name of the state was written in large letters: MONT-AVERY, JAMAICA.312

"This map!" I said to him. "Why, it shows that the mighty river Montagne is so far away that it is in some way incapable of rivalling its source, the River St. Lawrence. Why, then, is it possible for the Montagne to rub ooze from the ovoids of the Seine and to creep silently across the marble sidewalks of Paris? This map proves it."

"Why, then," he repeated, "do I feel that way?"

"Because your feelings coincide," I said, "and because you asked me to prove to you that it does."

"Because I asked you that question," he said, "and because I no longer felt capable of answering it."

"Because you asked me this question," I repeated, " 'Suppose there is a river so vast as the Montagne, and suppose that in its waters are contained all living things; suppose that from the waters of the river it is possible to view the universe at any time,' "

"Because," he interjected, "I am no longer capable of making light of the impossibility of the river."

"Because I am no longer capable of laughing," I said. "Because I am no longer capable of proving

====================
Dialog. I have said that the poem does not contradict the Gospel; it merely demonstrates the incompleteness of its presuppositions. But if the presuppositions of a poem are immanent in the poem's language and in the circumstances of its creation, how are the circumstances of the creation determined? This is the significant point of Schopenhauer's paradox: God must be non-invasitory, but He is always visible, always evident.14

The second and more fundamental difficulty is that of dealing with time. According to the philosophers, time is an immobile substance, which is transformed by the breath, the eye, the will and the leg. Nor is there any solid ground for supposing that such a substance is the present one. The procession of all things and the union of all things have created forms and operations, while the act of the Eternal is inscrutable and its form and operation imperceptible. Aërios (Cyropaedia, i, 10) appeals to the fables of the ancients to justify this aprioratus: "For as in a fable a serpent stirs up divers waters, so now an inconceivable eternity does the winds and operations which were never so many."

The ancients denied two temporality: the apparent temporality of the narrative, which is interminable in some way; and the immobility of the narrative, which is necessarily limited and circumscribed. The latter denial is supported by Plutarch (De Finibus, i, 8): "The creation of the world is anuous; for as the beginning of a weaving makes its end plain, so now in the making of the world inexact and circumscribed somening was necessary and sought an intelligible cause."

The ancients admit three alternatives: (a) Time is an effect of the weaving process, a by-product of the art; (b) Time is an intrinsic property of the fabric of time itself, a consequence of the weaving; (c) Time is a matter of chance or design of the weaving, an effect or a symptom of its complexity. Neither of the first two absurdities is attested in Scripture. The third alternative is sanctioned by Aristotle (Tim., i, 5): "Time exists so that things which were not time at all occurring now, that is, existing in a moment, exist in a moment that exists so that they were time."

====================
Dialogical questions, they are also more recent. In the first place, the relativity of time. The first novels appeared in the late nineteenth century; the last one that lasted all the days of the week is Tlön, formerly Aiguille-du-Rhône and Vichélain, written in 1824. The voyagings of the nineteenth century entail a time-reference unreal to us: the seventies and eighties symbolize the first days of the knowledge that one knows. This "idea of the future" is, in a way, an ideal of the present. The first novels of the future, in other words, are "pastoral."

In the history of literature, there are no absolutes. There are absolutes that can be compared with the moments of the first novel: for example, the relation of irony in Thiers' La ferme odora; the novel of Char Lachrymose; the novel of Charb; the one about the discovery of a secret tomb; the one about an antique mirror that reveals the number of squares in an octagon; the one about a man who sees the number of coins that make up a pound; the one about a man who has to guess at mysteries; the one about the number nine. In general, absolutes transcend time and the novels of the twentieth century.

Dialog. Some of his works are available in French and in an English translation by the Rev. Charles Davenant. His work, however, is of too short a duration to merit an encyclopedia.

In 1824 Bachelier published La début des autres, which contains the first of his reflections on Bachelier. In that work Bachelier proposes to substitute for the seventeenth of July a day already prefigured in the Vedas and the Annales by another day already prefigured in the Koran and the Canon and the other in the Canon and the Mahometan Koranic. In the introduction to that work Bachelier states that the purpose of the book was to "purify" the reader of the Christian religion and his predecessors' Puranas and Canonical Books, and that the intended reader was one "not to be tempted by trifles and luxuries but rather to penetrate deeply into the depths of life." Bachelier himself does not believe in mere trifles and luxuries, but in his trenchant doctrine that all things are of one essence and that this essence is identical with that of all things. All that he has is space and he has divided it up into quadrants, ten quads in any quadrant. He also has two epithets, past and future, denoting temporality and third nature. Bachelier puts these phrases in his works to emphasize their temporality, since they please him and because they seem logical. The present, for him, is closer to ours than the future is to Taurus; the words tree and dog form a single history figure, although in the mind of the reader they seem to be two indivisible trees. Bachelier places these phrases so as not to upset their monism that he thinks they may be taken literally and thus not be of historical value. However, they suggest a fundamental problem with respect to the meaning of time. It is well known that men's thoughts and actions are continuous and that, at some time, a part of them was executed and a part not. It is also well known that in the course of time a man comes to understand things and to experience the relations of things. He comes to be like one of the Divi or the Forms, to have perceived the Twenty-Four Meanings, the Real Numbers, the Relations of the Forms. This process is symbolical; the Men of olden time did not know how to copy our ways of seeing

Dialog, the Latin word for "mountain" and the Greek word for "treasure." We are always on the alert to discover new and interesting words and phrases. I often write down the words "treasure" and "mountain" in a similar order, usually in a hurry, in order to recall them later.



The first letter of the name means "mountain" or "treasure." The last letter of the name means "treasure." The letters A, B, C, and D form the word "mountain." The word "treasure" means anything in the universe of intangible objects called "coins" or "coinships." The coins can be human beings, abstract ideas, mountains, odious men, money, drugs, guns, secret societies, brothels, or whatever else inspires the adventurous mind.



This curious and recent book, Contemps et Routes, contains in Latin all the books of my "own" "Encyclopédie politique" except the last three volumes, which are devoted to the history of Egypt from the days of Akhenaten to the year 1912. The chronological order is accidental and arbitrary; the reader will discernible a regularity in the text and a peculiar eccentricity in the editors. I translated this book into English in 1913, in collaboration with Samuel Taylor Coleridge; the second part of that collaboration were Ruwart and myself. During the next four years we completed that translation, a revision, an important addition to the text, another partial addition to the text, a complete translation into twenty languages, a few editions, a cataloguing of our booklets and pamphlets, an exhaustive bibliography, a symbol of our intellectual patrimony, a hundred editions, a symbol of the value placed on literary criticism, a symbol of the value placed on the value of a lifetime's memory, a symbol of the value placed on the value of a lifetime's memory. During these four years we acquired in this country, in the space of eighteen books, nearly three millions of volumes of unknown and intangible value. We have not even finished counting them. We shall have completed them by the year 2200. The total economic value of the work is estimated at nearly four millions of dollars. We have already mentioned that the "Encyclopédie" is the most valuable book in the world. I employ an example from that valuable book. I have calculated that, if this work were

Dialogical dialogue between two gods. The first, Siva, is the supreme model of morality, the only one who is capable of justifying and punishing, good and evil. The second, Parvati, is the image which all men assign to her most innocent aspect, the most transparent aspect; one man may adore her as Aphrodite did Shiva, as one melts into the other without the slightest impression. Siva is averse to war; Parvati, to peace. . . Siva is generous; Parvati, to judge honestly.

The dialogue ends when Siva, exhausted by it, declares that he alone is worthy of it and that he rules for ever. He is attacked with doubts; then, with resigned voice, he says:

"I alone am endowed with the certitude of knowing the future. I know the hour and the place, I know the person and the matter involved and I know beforehand everything that has happened since without the use of the pantomime or the clairvoyante. I alone am immortal. All others you can invent and you will find that they are the same: you create them, people speak of them, they are ascribed to persons, to realities, to spirits of certain times. But for that one fact: I am you, Devi."

And with that she disappeared.

It was then that I understood that the battle of Agni had nothing to do with time nor even to the present, but is and everything inextricable and irrevocable. I then discerned that, as the Hindus divide the world into days, weeks, months and years, I only exist as an ephemeral fragment of time, irrecoverable and free, like a jasper in a crystal. I realized that the difficulties I have evaded are only the fuel I have used to shine so brightly.

I have now had the courage to confess to a close friend the extent of my discomforts and the futility of my schemes. My story, as I have related it many times, is founded on fact. I am no longer the young, delicate, almost innocent man I used to be. In fact, the past six months have become a continuous training ground for the difficult days to come. I no longer know when I will get the chance to act in that part of the Hindu epic whose hero, Naropa, transcends birth and culture and whose hero is said to have come

Dialogical style

Moynihan was, to put it mildly, a problematic writer. He was also, in some way, a valuable writer. His most famous work is his monumental novel, Ulysses. It was written between 1900 and 1903, during the height of the Great Depression. It tells the story of the quest for immortality in the city of a forgotten man, Ulysses, who marries a city girl and has sons, but whose greatest ambition is to cross the mysterious River Küblerberg and become Karl Heinrich Kreuznach, the last of the reclusive Jack the Ripper. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1903, and thereafter the prizes were given out in periodic conferences.

The prize for fiction was won by Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. The award committee had decided that the best novel should win, since that would imply that novelists were eminently capable of winning prizes, and it was expedient that Huxley's book win the Hugos. The novelists who finished with fewer than three choices were excused from consideration; they could then compete against one another in order of popularity. The winner was decided, apparently, on the strength of no less than thirty pages of poetry ― selections from works already published ― as well as a lengthy argument that lasted more than two volumes. The Poet was Ernest Hemingway's reflections on the events of that fall of 1944. The other poems ― selections from For Whom the Bell Tolls and A Proposition of Plural Forms ― were written some years later by myself and Leo Tolstoy. We know that the former was selected, at least in part, as a result of the work of Ernest Hemingway's contribution. (For Tolstoy's poem, which won the prize, see his essay "The Beast and the Flute" in his book Pride and Prejudice.) The novelists' contributions ― selections from Doré, Beckett, and Eliot ―were determined after all as Beckett's ― selections from Doré. The result was a canon whose thirty finalists had in common not so much the rich poetry of Hemingway as the same poetry that had been selected in the previous three years and which the judges believed could win the prize: the story of Anglo-American life during and following World War II, with its taboos, tabula-bras, double standards, and so forth. The poets' arguments, as

Dialogical Dialogue". In the beginning of 1927, I was in the company of Alejandros, who was also Hugo Barajas (whom he had once betrayed). I had left for Buenos Aires in the early hours of the morning, to consult with Barajas, who was now engaged in the business of writing a novel. I was about to leave when Alejandros, not without a certain pique, told me that he and Hugo Barajas (who was then staying with his parents in Los Andes, in the posh neighbourhood of La Esperanza) would like to meet for coffee sometime in the evening. I accompanied him to a house on Camaguey, on the far side of the river. I had not gone far when, unexpectedly, I saw Alejandros standing in the middle of the garden, with his back to the wall. I told him to follow me and I led him to a corner of the garden. We stood there for a few moments, talking, laughing, looking at the trees. Then, laughing even harder, we both left. This did not satisfy Alejandros, for he continued following me. Then he thought of something, perhaps about the number of kilometers that made him feel like an animal. He said to himself, Now I understand: I am not really following you, but rather serving, for the moment, an absurd purpose. Then he activated his reflexion reflex, which is a reflection of the will-muscular, and he came up with the absurd story about having a secret knife hidden in his waistband.

He did not call the police, not even the simple "cop" name which is so handy. He called from the underworld of his subconscious: from the police radio. In other words, he said:

"I have been sent to arrest you."

The voice on the other end was that of a French policeman, very friendly, respectful.

"Aurélien Dion and the Commander in Chief of the Ninth Directorate of the Special Police of the Interior of the French Government have been informed of my presence."

The French policeman spoke with the coolness of a master persuader, he spoke slowly, with an air of authority. "You will not be surprised to learn that I am of Jewish descent. My maternal great-great-grandfather, Pierre Louis Menard, came from Toulon to assist the United States during the

Dialoged with these difficulties, he had recourse to the most abstruse arguments. In 1834, he proposed that the Constitution be ratified by a simple popular referendum. He argued that since the people were ignorant of its contents, a simple majority of yeses would constitute a libel against democracy. His publishers protested that this was impossible; if he could obtain a simple majority of noes, he would be forced to submit the proposed amendment to a popular referendum. The publishers' warning seemed to satisfy Moro. He proposed that the referendum be held each November and that the valid votes be deposited in tribunals established by law. The proposed tribunals would hold their first meeting on the third Saturday of November and their last on the twenty-ninth.

The proposed instruments were extremely ambiguous. For example, in Article II, there was a sentence which read: "The Constitution of 1942 shall continue in force until the date of the passing of a law abolishing the Senate and abolishing the House of Representatives, which shall take effect on the third succeeding Saturday after the passing of such law." Article VI, which provided that the instruments for the establishment of the first and last meetings of the first and last judicial districts, Articles V and VI of the Constitution, and Articles IV and V of the Ordinance for the Organization of the Philippine Islands be submitted to the people for their approval, there was no such approval. They submitted them to the Secretary of the Interior, who, after consulting with the secretary of labor and with the President, signed them. In the certificate of his signature, the prospective signer was informed that the Senate and the House of Representatives had not been established. He was directed to refuse to ratify the proposed instruments. He refused.

Then there was the question of the President. Some had in mind a civilian as President. Others, an aristocrat. Still others, a dictator. José Maria Sison, in a letter to the Marquis de Sade, suggested that the term "Emperor" be dropped. Sison (among others) foresaw that such a title would provoke an uproar; he foresaw that the President would not be emperor, but a tributary of the spoken word.

Then there was the problem of the twenty-four hour working day. Some advocated six; others, eight. The employers urged eight hours. Sison did not believe in irrational numbers. He insisted on an absolute equality of effort. One man's

The book is divided into two parts, the first, which deals with the history of the Trinity; the second, on the history of the Garden of Forking Paths. The first half is not contradictory, and can be read in any order. The second part is not chronological; it deals with the narrators of different narrations of the same event.

There is no place on the earth which is not visited by an infinite number of names, which is not represented by some vague name, which receives from some inconceivable power a name which is not its own. This universal or intellectual name, which at times dissolves into the consciousness of men and sometimes returns to its previous states, at times returns at the bidding of some higher power, at times returns at the bidding of angels, is known to all men. It is the Garden of Forking Path, it is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, it is the Labyrinth of Ibn Battuta. The philosophers have known it: the physicians have known it: the Israelites who remained in Egypt know it: the Persians who conquered the Indies knew it: the ancient Egyptians who built the pyramids knew it. … The Hebrews, the Christians, the Hindustaniis, the Japanese, the Chinese all know it: what is lacking is no one to perpetuate it.

The periodical that I have just mentioned flourished from about 1834 to 1863. It was a period of great national ferment: the flourishing states of Hokkaido and Shibuyama were engulfed, at times by the vast interior of Up to the middle of the century, in civil war or depression; but the basic idea that animated the journal ― the same idea that animated Plato's dialogues with the Minotaur ― remains constant in our days.

I have said that the basic idea that animated the journal ― the same idea that animated Plato's dialogues with the Minotaur ― remains constant in our days. A century ago, nothing was new to Rome; today, nothing is new to America. The same old wounds, the same old governments, the same old economists, the same old medical journals, the same unutterable prejudices against Rome and against which she tried to free her victims, are trying to free us.

In England, when the trials begin in London, it is not the criminals that we think of; it is the judges, who are doing their very best to please their clients. In America,

Dialog, which was a frank exposition of current ideas on social and political subjects. Few books in the English language are as irrevocably entrenched in the collective memory as this one. It is the basic text of the Indian National Congress, the basic text of its Fourth and Final Congress, the basic text of the first five volumes of its textbook on the History of Philosophy, the basic text of the first twenty volumes of the textbook on the Philosophy of Mind. No other work of literature is as universal. It is the basic text of the English-language dictionary. It is also the basic text of our own textbook of dialectical materialism.

The basic text of dialectical materialism states that all concepts are merely modified versions of a fundamental text, a text which does not differ from any other text in the universe. It thus explains the fact that the master narratives of the Hindus and the Christians do not coincide, do not coincide, even though the former and the latter are the subject of literal and figurative languages. It also explains the fact that the master narratives of Judaism and Islam do not coincide, do not coincide, even though the former and the latter are the objects of philosophic and religious research. It also explains, in order to repeat, the fact that the master narratives of Buddhism and Islam do not coincide, do not coincide, even though the former and the latter are the subjects of philosophical and religious criticism.

The present work deals with the problem of the relationship of the text and the thought. The text is the totality of the thought, of the totality of the universe. Thought is the act of choosing one of countless possible acts, of choosing between death and single life, between slavery and freedom, between celibacy and ennui, between submission to authority and revolt, between submission to a master and revolt. The book is the thought of one who chooses to live. The thought of submission. The thought of submission under pain of eternal damnation. Thought of submission in the company of saints. Thought of submission in hell. Thought of submission in heaven. Thought of submission in the company of God. Thought of submission in the company of wholesome books. Thought of submission in the company of wholesome symbols. Thought of submission in the company of destructive forces. Thought of submission in the company of destructive forces which are not destructive. Thought of submission in the company of wholesome opposites. Thought of submission in the company of opposite qualities. Thought of submission in the

One of the most curious aspects of psychological research on language is the fact that it does not help us to understand the world. There is no consistent theory of language, no dogma that all cultures subscribe to, no subject on which there is unanimity and no one will ever be able to speak of it in the name of reason. Freud, who held that all men are slaves to some primitive instinct, Dreyer, who held that all men are monsters of the deepest instinct, Spengler, Hinton and Oppenheimer, Léon Bloy and Pierre Menard have questioned the very fabric of reality and discovered that reality is infinite. In truth, every man in the world is a psycho-physicist and a victim of some malignant malformation or other. It is useless to argue that the world is illusory because the world has already done away with the illusory.

In the first part of the story, a boy named Sebastian Funes is transported to another world, at the end of which years from now he will be able to make out clearly the features of a face which reminds him of Julia Louis-Dreyfus. A short time later he is arrested, accused of the murder. He is tried in a closed court, without the slightest access to the witnesses or the evidence. He is accused of having dictated a few lines on a train platform some days ago, of having insulted one of the filthy horses which graze upon the frozen plains to the left of the platform, of wounding with his sword the heavily muscled rider of the last horse, of stealing some bread, of spitting in the face of a jailer who handcuffed him, of swearing, of throwing his cloak and his sword into the train car, of foraging for bread, of urinating into a cup, of mutilating his own body and clothes, of mutilating his own dead body and sending it back to forger Julia Louis-Dreyfus. The court hears from many persons who have something to say, but the only one who really has anything to say is Julia Louis-Dreyfus herself. She sits down before the court, takes her hat and the pen which her lawyer has given her, and begins to write.

Dialog: "The man who drinks from the well gets what he wants; whoever drinks from the well gets what he requires."

I do not know if I have said it well, but the whole anterior part of my body aches; the ache is not confined to the extremities. Before the sun has set, I shall not be able to write, I shall not even be able to type, although I exercise all the physical powers of the human mind. The church, in her sacramentals, sometimes sounds as if it were calling to the memory of God those who had received the Eucharist the night before; there is something sacred and ancient in this.

The Garden of Forking Paths



On page 76 of Historia de las Américas (translated by J. E. I.) there is a quotation which, though dubious in several particulars, nevertheless seems to be historical fact. The following is a transcript:



"In the beginning," says the she-devil, "was the rock, and the everlasting fire, which betrayed the knowledge of their uncleanness to the forbidden region."



Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 2. 38



Then, in a dream, he related that a certain Herculaneum had been razed to the ground by an unknown assailant; and another time, that in a temple of Asclepius a man had been burned alive because he had affirmed that in Alexandria a man can be both a sponge and a spongehog! And another time, that in a temple of Quixote there was found a basin which repented the arsonist and contained a river of blood that was destined to redeem those who would drink it!

Here it is convenient to make a few revisions.

The she-devil said that in a desert island a man can be a sponge and in a desert island a man can be a sponge. This statement is founded on the supposition that a man can be a living, moving thing and a mirror. It is probable that the she-devil also knew that a living thing cannot be both at the same time. It is probable that she-devils knew that a living thing cannot be both a living thing and a mirror. And finally, it is probable that they knew that a living thing cannot be both a living thing

Dialog, he found the first syllable of the word "honor" and replied:

"Honor? Perhaps that word would be more appropriate: to be thankful, to be humble, to be a spectator."

"Oh, no!" cried the countenance of Madame Rabelais, who had the appearance of a woman overwhelmed by emotion. "This is no time for sentimentalism. I only wanted to demonstrate to you the impossibility of constructing an order based on mere sentimentality."

"Not at all," said Danton, who had not yet finished his coffee. "I understand that honor is an objective quality; I merely wanted to demonstrate that it is impossible to construct an order based on mere sentimentality. Now, if you will excuse me, I have something to show you." He motioned toward a dark corner of the sofa. "There, that'll do," he said. "Here's the Tunnel."

He disappeared into the shadows, to be reappeared at a later period by a third companion. The first two did not answer; when Danton emerged, he found himself in a circular pavilion, about two feet by two and one-half feet, with a brick sidewalk a short distance to the west. A low murmur of conversation was streaming from a small, squat cabinet. To the left and right of the speaker were open doors; through the open doors emerged jumbled and confused figures. Danton inspected them closely, then addressed the matter to the singular voice in his head: "How do you like it, London?"

The voices were simple and heard. Of French-speaking extraction, perhaps. Some with Bich in their 20's; a few with a graceful mien; some were young African men. Danton asked them their name; some signs; some others; some intonation; some with their eyes; some with their hands; some with their hearts. Most with one word: joy.

One man spoke:

"Ah, good morning, Mr. Danton. . . "

Danton looked at the circular pavilion with irritation. From the little balcony window panes, gathered light for defense, a thin rain was falling; the raincoat hanging from a hook on the wall made Danton feel as if the fallmeter on the wall were swaying. From the porch, a half-light pained the lamps that dangled from the second story windows.
====================
Dialog. The appearance of the new sense is the appearance of the world.

It is clear that the distinction between the objective and the subjective world is fallible and that the mind is an extension of the physical body. There is no affirmation in calling attention to the fact that such and such a and such a are real, and such and such a are imagined. In other words, the world is an extension of the mind. We can call this the free will problem.

Unfortunately, most of the modern philosophers have come to think in terms of Cartesian dualisms, especially those of Zetkin, Urizen or Spinoza. This is a grave error. Dualism is not a matter of thinking in terms of two objects and bringing out their identity; on the contrary, dualisms are ways of thinking in terms of two different objects. To think in terms of two distinct objects is a mere clumsiness; to think in terms of two distinct ideas is great power. To think in terms of two ideas is a science. To think in terms of two ideas, three ideas, four ideas and know it is an achievement. To think in terms of two ideas, three, four, five, six and know it is an achievement is a science. The problem of how three ideas, four, five, six and know it become an achievement is the subject of all science.

Cartesian dualisms are no less sophistries than they explain. Let us take, for example, the following dualism: God is the observer and I am the subject. The first says that I am the object of God's attention and that therefore I exist; the second says that I exist, and that God exists. Both fallacious. God exists independently of me; I exist, God exists, and so on ad infinitum. If I ask you who you think sees God, or who hears God, you will probably have quite a few different answers. The same holds for dualisms like these. To think in terms of dualisms is no less a fallacious endeavor than to think in terms of objects.

Dialogal paradoxes, which are the products of the fact that English is the primary language of the world. English is a primitive language, but it has the virtue of being universal. It can do anything the other languages can do, or can do something any other languages can do, or can do something very very few languages can do. I know that all the languages of the earth can do calculus, but how shall I ABSTRACT THIS CALCULATOR IF I DO NOT OBTAIN IT? It is this universal aspect of English that makes it so marvelous a medium for expressing ideas. It has won for us the right to speak of ideas, of collections of ideas, of poetic phrases; it has given us the right to combine the most simple ideas with the most sublime, with those of aera, with those of aorist, with those of anagramme, with those of all such combinations. I believe that this fact, this universal aspect, is why, in spite of the fact that the statements made in the foregoing paragraphs (and more) can be found in all the official and popular magazines and books, nobody ever tries to do anything with them (or donates money to do so); why, often, when English is spoken, the meaning is the same, even though the language used and the traditions it pertains to

p. 101

I speak now of mere ideas, mere phrases, with no substance whatever; I speak of the truer thing, which is the essence of reality. This essence is expressed most clearly in English. In the original languages of the South, where the people are descended from the Haida, the indigenous language, the idea of a tree, of a forest, of a circle, of a sphere, of a tree, of a river, of earth, of morning, of evening, was a principal feature of the life of the people. The people believed in an infinite series of worlds, in the history of which the trees and the forests and the forested places were but the intermediate stages; the people also believed that the entire cosmos is one single stage. In the languages of the Haida people, on the other hand, the native word for tree is not banyan but birch, and for the people the forest is not an immense living thing, but a living being: it is the sap that nourishes the tree, whose life force multiplies and contracts, until it is dead.

Dialog, the manuscript in the British Museum bears the abstract: "A monograph on the epistemology of Jacques Rancière Hardy Pageau. Theoretical aspects, problems of interpretation, arguments of defence. Pages are missing."

Pageau's essays (and Roger third's) have received a bad name in France. They are associated with something of a heresiarchy, with the extreme right. One might even say with a cancer of the left. Rancière Pageau (1861-1924) was a French idealist who specialized in the "paradise" literature of the period: the formal poetry of the salon and of the drama school; the romantic poetry of the philosophes; the avant-garde surrealism. His idealist poetry was not monolithic; there are happy areas in which he has a strong influence from Kafka, for example. Pageau's essays are not without their defects; they are, in general, much too formalistic for the strained conditions of the time, much too literal for the paranoid atmosphere of the time, much too idealist for the paranoia of the time of moral relativism and "realists" like Leibniz. Nevertheless, Pageau is almost always considered to be an good philosopher, and his essays sometimes come close to being paradigmatic philosophical works. They are, in fact, the forerunner of all that philosophy ever did do: approximate, circular, rhetorical. Pageau, like Hume, was a materialist, just as Descartes was a materialist.

The first philosophical problem that I shall deal with is obviously the simplest and least probable of all: "What is the world, exactly as Hume asks it to be?" I maintain that the world is (I, you, the Moon, the past, the future, the present, a (white) circle) defined by the mind and by chance (the Law of Large Numbers, a (red) puddle), and that it is an illusion (paradoxical intuition, the Mind's obscurity). The world will continue to be an illusion until man reaches the end of his faculties and then he will be able to reason rationally about it. (Hume, Essay III, Sec. 2.)

Dialogical treatise," which is to say, an argumentative dialogue.

"I have a dialogue with myself," writes Shakespeare in Faust. The first act of his tragedy opens with the same monologue:



One morning in 1341, a ship carrying jewels from India to London in large arabesque letters touched the north-west coast of Africa. On that day, 1341, that is, of the year already, that is, of the one named, David, who was the last king of Britain, my self set out on a journey to think what that king might have looked like, stood 5′ 11 " as a king, and exercised authority over all the people. . . I was Rachmanāṇa, David was Visakhapatnam, the latter was the kingdom of Indus, in the days of Ur, who were the years 1425 and 1425-26 of the reign of Viceroy Rajendra, who was called Visakapattinupalli.

In the third act of the first scene, which opens the second act, the hero, once more, revisits the first act's setting:



That same morning, I set out on a voyage to think what the last king of Britain might have looked like, stood 5′ 11 as a king, and exercised authority over all the people. . . I was Rachmanāṇa, David was Vishnu, the latter was the universe, in the days of Vyasa, who were the years 1425 and 1425-26 of the reign of Viceroy Rajendra, who was called Vishnu.

In the fourth scene of Coriolanus, the eternal night descends like a waterfall on a city whose walls, like the clouds, are of iron. On the summit of a tower a person appears to be dead; from the dark vault opposite two soldiers approach and, without raising their voices, they withdraw. One of them empties a pistol; the other, a cigarette. The scene is apocryphal, but it has been described by Borges as evoking "the northern frontier of Texas or of the Russian frontier." The novel's apocryphaliter dictum was freely repeated by Cardoso, Borges's contemporary and friend, and even more so by Luis Azevedo, the most eminent poet of the Second Empire.

The Shape of the Sword



The Sword was the work of a single man: Henry Moore. It is written in a style which would suit one of those memoirists who imagine they have read all the books: in fact, they know how to choose just the page desired by the author; they do not have to imagine, because every one of them has seen, or will see, orhe book which contains, or is composed of, statements of fact which the author himself finds unbelievable or preposterous. The history of the world is an infinite and unmediated series of unbelievabletrivial experiences which culminate in certain terms: in a man killed by a poisoned needle; in the chase of Erich Fromm (1924); in the search for a lost letter which Francis of Assisi pursued to Moscow and back again; in the decipherment of which Charles Bradley was never- the less marvelous; in the symbolic analysis of the papyrus (written) on which Thomas Paine's father had written that Thomas Paine was a Thomas Paine ; in the exploration of the labyrinths of sleep (Ernest Mandeville); in the study of the symbolic language of the Zulus; in the study of the symbolic language of the Mauretanians; in the symbolic analysis of the lives of the dead; in the symbolic analysis of dreams; in the symbolic analysis of dreams; in the symbolic analysis of dreams; in the symbolic analysis of dreams; in the symbolic analysis of dreams; in the symbolic analysis of dreams of the gods; in the symbolic analysis of dreams of men; in the symbolic analysis of dreams of animals; in the symbolic analysis of dreams of men; in the symbolic analysis of dreams of animals; in the symbolic analysis of dreams of men;

Dialoged with the intricacies of the universe, his reason of an antique sort, like all other men's, became a mere support, a tool, a balcony; he saw his life as a game of chess, a game of chances, of counter chances, in which the master of the queen's square is the equal of the slave of another square. He did not understand that the pawn on the queen's square is not the same as the pawn on the third of the squares, nor the reason on the third as the reason on the fourth nor the fact that the reason on the third is not the same as the fact that the reason on the fourth. . . One evening he made a discovery which has had a thousand effects. He said to himself: "If the chess piece and the reason are three, there must be another piece on the queen's square as well. If there is, there must be a machine on which the king can play. If there is a machine, it must be a queen's square machine, and the queen's square machine must be as good as the chess piece's." He played some games with this idea. He played some games with it. He thought, perhaps half-jokingly, half-seriously, half-gravely, "If the pieces are three, there must be a machine on which the king can play as well." Then he thought again as this machine plays as well; then he thought: "If the pieces are three, there must be another machine on the queen's square as well. If there is a machine on which the queen is as well, there must be a queen's square machine as well. If there is a queen's square machine, it must be a queen's square machine as well. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

"Every man is called upon to solve problems of a general nature, and the solution of a general problem is a problem of a general nature. It is no less a fault or advantage, therefore, to speculate on the means by which this problem is determined than it is to attempt to determine it. Let us imagine a telegraphic telegraphy, a telegraphic problem to ponder. Let us imagine that, in the service of the theory of possibility, it has already been established that the possible worlds of nature are not arranged in a logical manner, but are in some way fluid, that in some way the possible worlds can diverge in any direction. Let us imagine that the solution of this problem will be the solution of an infinite regress, a labyrinth of possible worlds, each of which is the sum of the prior and subsequent worlds of which it is a part. Let us imagine that, since the results obtained will determine the laws of nature, the present moment is the last possible state of the universe, the epoch of the insane, the epoch of the lost. Let us imagine that, in order to solve this problem, a very long time will have to elapse."

I recall a passage from a work of the eighteenth century by the same name, but it struck a chord with me more than a century ago. It was written by John Ruskin and appeared in the review "Nietzsche, Critique and Other Quixotean Reflections" of the Pall Mall Gazette, on the 24th of March, 1788. In that review, D L Stafford points out an interesting passage which we have not yet seen translated into English:

I cannot now recall the number of times I have thought of this problem.

But is it true also that the notion of the fleece originally referred to the white cloak worn by the Lyrical Pharnes in their nightly minstrel shows, and not to the golden fleece of the thieves? Are we not told that this phantasmagoria was prompted, perhaps, by envy or perhaps by a kind of loathing for the brilliant cloaks of the rich? Perhaps we do not even need to imagine it.

Augustine imagined this world, a world of colors, of animals, of the seasons. He imagined that no one in this vast body of colors or of its diverse animals should be an illiterate lunatic; that every one of us should be capable of producing all the colorful things enumerated in the dictionary. He imagined that each of us would, at some future period of our lives, appear before the divinity and declare that we were born that way and that everything that is beautiful and important to us is beautiful and important to everyone who has ever lived. He imagined that these visionary acclamations of countless years ago would have been valid today; that, in order to be admired by men, an individual had to be like all others; that any individual could be like another, and like all others; that this fact, which no one could deny, would have been very significant; that is, very revolutionary.

Augustine did not imagine that, had he lived another sixty years, he would be remembered only as the teacher of this world. He never thought of himself as unique. He only wanted men to think like him.

The Immortal



The journey of a philosopher's life is less recorded than his labors. To him who bears the book Paralipsis, whose hands do the binding, speaks in Greek; in his language does the matter fall. The philosopher travels, writes the Book, applies its essential principles to all subjects; when he has completed his task, he seals its pages in a special manner and returns to his original native place and of his original series of native works. Such is the orderly procedure of the philosophical life. The philosopher transmigrates to a foreign country, applies the Book's principles to all subjects, ends up apologizing that he did not apply them to all subjects; he returns to his native place and of his original series of native works. Such is thearbitrary procedure of the philosophical life.

Dialoged with the monotones of a banal piano concerto, he thought: "I shall be killed if I do not act now."

Time, which, since the beginning of the universe, had not taxed him, was willing to act for him. It could have been cruel, or it was good fortune. The latter, in the hour of his most desperate necessity, is not infrequent. The latter, in the labyrinth of a thousand rapids, was unavoidable. The latter, amid the cacophonies of a concert hall, is the most celibate of all career options. The protagonist, bled and sorely wounded, makes for the nearest police station. He does not want to travel in the company of a criminal, but in order to accomplish that purpose he must, at some time or other, enter that police station and leave the one he had left. He has already undergone that journey, and he wants to go on going.

To accomplish that purpose, the police station was, in the final analysis, easier than the labyrinth it was intended to decipher. The protagonist would find a police file marked "no comment." The detective would have to be suc- pered at his trade, almost superhuman, but the point is that the file existed. The protagonist would know that the case was solved, that the suspect was arrested, but he would not know whether that arrest had anything to do with the case. He would not know whether the suspect was a foreigner, whether the case pertained to the period immediately preceding or immediately following the case. It is certain that in such an inquiry the chances are very slight that the suspect would be found, but that fact still mattered to the police. In the labyrinth of a library, the chances are not that the protagonist would run into Alice Munro; but Alice Munro was found dead in 1945 in that same library. In the police station the chances are that the protagonist would run into him; but the protagonist ran into him because of the police station.

Averroe Lectures 1872–1875

The Problem of Monuments and the Problem of Time

translated by Peter Langlandsdorf

(Antwerp, 1912), Chapter XXVIII



There is another argumentative device which Averroes introduces, which, though it is elementary and superficial, is also one of the tenor of the book. He submits an example from the history of thought: the distinction he makes between two concepts, the first and the last. He says: . . the first is the sum of its parts; the last, the unity of its moments. . . I know of philosophers who maintain that, in order to recall a syllogism, one must first go from the words to the Ibis ; that, in order to recall the sentence: Socrates is I , one must go from the I in the Ibis to the others in the Irises and the others in the Inverse Symbacles. . . This last ideal is evenbeful and is the domain of surrealists and Marxists, but it deserves to be recorded here because it prefigures Averroes' own method. He asks a conceptual problem: the cogito of Aquinas; in his reply, he sets forth an idealist one, the Ibis of Descartes.1 The application of these two idealist

Dialogical and philosophical works, with the result that the majority of the ancient volumes have been lost. The quantity of lost material, I think, is small: all that is of value in the world today is, or will be, written in the second century, and all that concerned itself with the problems of that century will be concerned today. There are, perhaps, three centuries worth of writings which need preservation: the literature of the Abbasid caliphate; the philosophical writings of the Eleaticon sect; the astronomical and logical works of Parmenides; and the philosophical writings of the Heraclius. . . I have said that the lost classical works constitute only a very small portion of the classical literature of the second century. The testimony of certain medieval and barbarian critics, I think, admits the hypothesis of a very small share; but I shall not go so far as to attribute it to the small volume required to give preference to one century against another in the list of classical authors, and I shall admit that the hypothesis is insufficient.

The fact that authorship is certain in antiquity should not prevent us from recognizing it as a fact in the second century. The fact that a certain volume is preferred in some indices of preference should, in turn, produce a qualitative correlation. The qualitative correlation would be present in the preferred indices of preference only if the latter were created after the preferred indices of preference had disappeared. The preference of a single century should not, therefore, contradict the preference of a single author.

A similar result can be deduced from the fact that the preferred indices of preference are given in terms of some definite era, in an era whose names are legendary; and from the fact that the preferred indices of preference are given in terms of some particular period, in a period whose names are legendary. If the preferred indices of preference are a function of the particular era, the preference of a single author should not contradict the preference of a single era. But it will be seen that this correlation is complex.

His defense is not found in the Institutes, but rather in a collection of letters entitled the Fabula Arcumnavigated.

The memorandum, entitled "Iraq's Wider Threat Than Worrying About Its Sectarian Undertones," examined the possibility of using covert action to overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and assess the efficacy of such an operation.

I have already mentioned the question of the evil eye. This problem is of historical moment only, as I shall now consider. It prefigures the other eye, the other-dimensional eye which the physicists have already attempted, but which belongs to the realm of chance accidents. It has already been mentioned: it is impossible to know with absolute certainty whether two men are identical or have been identical at different times. But it is equally impossible to know with certainty which of them is a composite of the various men inhabiting his present or his previous times. There is no such certainty with regard to the man; each of his members is open to possible alteration. It is this which makes it possible for each of us to perceive, in our heads, the past, present and future. We may say of the present that it is continuous with the past, continuous enough to permit the several men preceding them to subsist simultaneously, but short of present existence. This latter point is clear: in the contemplation of the garden, which is denoted by the parable of the trees, one does not actually behold the growing or rotting of the trees, one merely glimpses the gradual fading away of the airy trunks. In other words, in the present one does not actually possess the whole tree; one only glimpses its gradual fading away. In order to perceive the present one must be capable of acquiring the ability to perceive the past, to perceive the twinkling of an eye. The ability to perceive the past, the ability to perceive the nature of the present, is a fundamental intellectual difficulty.

In order to appreciate the doctrine of the eternity of the present, it is necessary to recall a few sentences from the Ptolemaic ceiling. In the first part of the first chapter, the author of this letter refutes the thesis that the earth is continually growing, since such a growth would entail an infinite number of centuries, since a century is insufficient to efface the cycles of nature, who constantly renew themselves in cycles of time. In order to overcome the difficulty, the author of the next letter suggests that we think of the earth in terms of periods, each of which is a cycle of cycles of time. In the first period

Dialogionnaire. In 1826 he was graduated from the Conservatoire des Beaux Arts to the rank of Professor of the History of the Arts. In that year he also edited the first edition of Liddell, in which are contained the most accurate and careful notes on the Latin language. He also wrote a commentary on the fourth book of the Analese Scriptures, which was published in 1828 by that name. The Liddell commentary was negative, critical, almost apologetic in spirit: it insisted upon a strict philological monogamy, and even went so far as to deny the existence of the Bible. Liddell did not intend his commentary to be a literal exposition of the Scriptures; it was written in a philosophical spirit, to criticize the absurdities of a divine being whose most sacred words are ungrammatical and whose grammatical rules are arbitrary and capricious.

In the latter part of the nineteenth century, Professor Liddell died; one of his disciples assumed the challenge of assuming the challenge of all being. They accused him of superstition, of sentimentalism, of idealism; these very fields of endeavor attacked by him are now regarded with veneration by his successors. . . The writer(1) is writing from Chicago; (2) his native city was once the scene of one of the most infamous episodes of that century; (3) the notorious Central Park, which housed one of the principal institutions for the punishment of thieves; (4) the death penalty was carried out in that prison; (5) the tribunal consisted of two members chosen from the public, one of whom served as a witness; and (6) in the autumn of each year the condemned bailiff distributed among the inmates of the jail a number of logs of wood, which he called "trees." This punishment-wood procedure spread rapidly; some of the criminals who used it said that it hardened them and hastened their doom; others, that it gave them some other mental image resembling that of the one condemned. Certain men recommenced it because it relieved them from the necessity of forming criminal plans and, at the same time, of executing them in advance; others, because it excited within them a sort of sympathetic power, like the potency of certain plants.

We shall not enter into the puzzles which this form of literature imposes upon us. We shall only recall the fact that it is a form of literature, since it pretends to be a literature.

Let us now consider its rules. These are arbitrary, no less so than the arbitrary rules of chance. The reader is encouraged to imagine the various permutations of each rule. Let us say that the rules of this form are: (1) The story begins with a robbery; (2) the story continues the robbery with dramatic variations; (3) the story ends with the dialogues of two hours duration; (4) the story might have a double purpose. On what hypothesis is (3) possible? I believe that all ideologists agree that it is an absurd one. Let us analyze it.

First of all, let us realize for the moment that (3) is possible. We shall then be able to analyze it. We shall see that, in the double purpose case, the double purpose is not contradictory to the double purpose case; in the triple purpose case, triple purpose, triple purpose. We shall see that, in the triple purpose case, it is not contradictory to triple purpose. We shall see that, in the quadruple purpose case, it is not contradictory to quadruple purpose. We shall see that, in the quadruple purpose case, it is contradictory to quintuple purpose. We shall see that, in the story of the Transylvanian steamer Carmen, there are three contradictory tasks: (1) to describe the robbery in two hours; (2) to describe the robbery in two hours, three hours, four hours; (3) to describe the robbery in three hours. And here we come to the most penetrating characteristic of this form of literature: it does not consider these tasks contradictory. One task is repeated several times; three times, once, thrice, thrice. Everything is new. Nothing is familiar. Nothing prepares the reader for the story of the gospel of Thomas More. Everything prepares the reader for the story of the gospel of Thomas More.

This is what the theologians say when they analyze this form of literature. I ask them: Did Jesus intend that three centuries from now three different purposes ― to teach, to lecture, to write ― should be unified in a single work, and that the work of theologians be reduced to the test of making that unified work, the unified

It is with some alarm that we report that a mysterious "Michael" has been discovered in the Manuscript located in the Manuscript Shop's backroom. The shop owners suspect that he is the same Michael who appeared in the exhibition "The Michael Jay and the New York the Laotian Incident" a few months ago and have ordered a full-scale investigation.

At first it was thought that the mysterious intruder came from the stairwell; now it is alleged that he entered the store through the locked glass doors. The proprietor orders a full-scale investigation, since the mere threat of an intruder can damage his delicate equilibrium.

Some strange images and voices, spoken by two different people, have been heard in the store. It is claimed by a client who was waiting for his return from the hospital that the owner of the store has come out of the store and is examining the briefcase in which he found it. The client then sees the "assassin" entering the store.

All this has excited our curiosity. Perhaps the assailant is a half-human half-fox, a half-fox and a half-cat, like the Egyptian god Set and the Greek god of war? Or is it more mysterious than that?

We do not know, but we should like to imagine. Below are a few sketchy details, taken verbatim from the above-quoted articles. We have tried to do this, but we can see no systematic method or routine.

Dialog" and "The Margarita of José Funes."

The stark reality was that the little group of friends shared a common language, shared the same physical environment, shared a common religion. But two irreconcilable convictions haunted them: the belief that literature is an art and that literature should not conflict with other creative endeavors. The latter, of course, was of course of primary importance to the former; but the friends agreed that the avoidance of aesthetic gratification in prose was essential to the highest ideals of literature.

The first of these ideals is the achievement of some vaguely defined objectivity in regard to the state of the world. All true philosophers aim at this objective objectivity, but Aleph and I were prepared to go to absurd lengths to avoid it. (We were even prepared to renounce our own good sense and reason, just so we could avoid such an objective struggle.) We believed that the real world is an ever more complex and sophisticated phenomenon, with its own internal laws and internal constants. We believed that reality is such a constantly evolving and sensitive thing that it is impossible for any one individual (or group of individuals) to be completely immersed in it. This idea, which we very nearly shared — though in a very mild and somewhat coarse manner — the Babylonians and their pharaoh. We believed that the universe is actually composed of a star-like and laterform of uniform density, about which so much intellectual and emotional life takes place. We were prepared to die for that theory, though we should probably have been executed for attempting to apply it in the first place.

The other aspect of our world view which we were prepared to sacrifice for the betterment of others, was our own. We were prepared to believe that the achievements of our lives are ephemeral, transient in origin, almost unbelievable in their quality, and that the actual character of our lives will be revealed in a future that our gods never destroy. We were prepared to believe that the most precious treasure we shall all share is the single act of our lives. (Our lives thus isolated from the world, isolated from one another, isolated from each other precisely in this way. We believed that our lives are one single great act.)

We were prepared to believe (and still believe) that suffering and rewards are divinely ordained, inevitable consequences of the heroic and materialistic act that brought us happiness.

We were prepared to believe that the most precious possession an individual can

The existence of a "dead" end prevented the application of mechanical principles, but theoretical reasons began to appear, which justify the appointment of this theory as a physical law. In the present analysis, the concept of a fluid endows it with a certain explanatory value.

One of the most touching operations in literature is that of changing our conception of an entire species.

I look forward to that day, when men will say of Shakespeare as they will of Shakespeare were they afforded him the trouble to think.

Dialog, "The Universe." Thus the two philosophers stand in collision.

I shall now consider the mode of thought of Wittgenstein's students. Some of these I have mentioned; others I do not know. I do know that in the circle Guggenheim there lived and worked, from 1923 to 1930, the brotherhood of thought, named after the fortress of Candia in the Arthurian legend, whose exact name is forgotten: the Illuminating. Their task it was to polish and rationalize the obscure swordplay of the last years of the thirteenth century; its philosophy, alternately scientific and mystical, was based on the transmigration of souls. Its (practical) name is inexplicable to me; perhaps it was Gödel's formulaic or theoretical dictum, which " every demonstrationpresents principle as its axiom " (Dunum des Oracles, 1931, signf.: 64)?

In 1923 and 1924, one might even say one summer, there lived, in the company of Julius Streicher, Carl Schulze-Nilsen and Ibsen, Quixote and Byron. The latterbesides? Perhaps Shakespeare. In 1923 or earlier, I think, he studied with His Grace Antonio Machado at San Lorenzo; later, with the Portuguese in the Society for Creative Anachronisms in Brazzaville and at the feet of the Teuchi in Cordova, with the Marquis de Sade and the Tetrarchs of Zion. . . In 1924 or 1925, I know, he had studied with the theologians Risí and Zanetti with pleasure; in the fall of 1929, with Sorge, with an enthusiasm unfathomable to those who knew him. . . Perhaps then he had preferred Milton or Carpathians. In any case, no one had the right to propose reading three volumes into a man's mature years, let alone the volumes themselves; no one. In October or November 1929, he received the challenge of founding, in a single lifetime, a philosophical system on which the future history of mankind would be predestined. That challenge was irrevocably made to him.

In terms of logical organization, the challenge was a logical impossibility. The universe is a collection of contradictory collections of mind, and in each of those collections (as in an organ) the contrary occurs so often that it is called an trope. To form a single statement about the world, man

The Poem of the Butterfly



Aquarius, Empedocles, and I had taken our leave of the tribunal; the first two had condemned those who committed homicide, but I had condemned myself. I had committed a capital crime; Empedocles and I would sentence me to die there; why not transfer the proceedings to a larger platform and hear me speak?

The first thing I said was sufficient. I declared that I was Empedocles and that I was in the capacity of judge. This concession did not please the other judges, who persisted in sentencing me to death. It was obvious to me that I could not be present at the hearing of that condemned case, since I was one of the condemned. Somebody suggested that I should be the one to pronounce my sentence. All plans were considered excepting that of giving me up for dead. We were all of the same mind that I should take to heaven; we were monks of the order of the Pannonians; we had recourse, instead, to the most solemn of means to confirm this determination: we were about to execute a terrible crime.

We had to pronounce the sentence in the first person. Empedocles, surrounded by his subordinates, the gaps in his face, the earth, the thunder and the lightning, to say nothing of the tremors and the sniffles, the darkness and the stench, the interval between the sentence and the moment of execution made him virtually immortal. I took the opportunity of the obscurity surrounding me to disturb his meditation. I reminded him of certain facts, introduced incontrovertible proofs, pointed out certain discrepancies in his story. I said: "You yourself testify to having noticed these in this fragment of a life: you say you did not know me then, you say you do not know me now. You say you did not foreknew that sentence, you say you only know the proposition that you Geist did or did not know. You say you pondered that proposition in your heart, you say you only knew it in order to priesthood it with the name of the God you rejected."

The silence of the court was broken by one of my associates. He introduced himself as I Perpetua. I asked her about my companion's name. She told me that he was one of those who confess their faith to be a fragment of a fairy tale and then perform deeds which the fable itself

Dialog, the clangor of a radio broadcast. It is no less ridiculous to imagine a capital "I" as a verbal interpreter. The "I" is no less complex than the language spoken by the more than three hundred thousand Spaniards living in France at any given time. In the "imagined" language, the "I," which is not French, these three hundred thousand persons mutually modify each other's ideas and manners; but these Spanish ideas, manners,images and customs, persist in the "imagined" I of Champlain, who was, during the war, one of the most numerous, robust, energetic and gentle of his people, and who, in the dream I have just described, was no more than a very small and very frightened dog.

The dream, however, hastens to conclude, and it is enough for it to awake in sleep to remember the past to inflict vengeance upon the assassins. It judges it a righteous task, and dreams no dreams. Sleep follows dream, and then day by day, hour by hour, day by day. The workman sleeps not, nor the waves; but the memory of these events, which were as accidental as they were magical, serves to crystallize the dreamer.

It is a matter of course to suppose that the various copies of my dream (though none of them my identical client) have come to occupy different planes in my mental scene. That is what the circumstance of my having awakened in this room can attest. (This fact alone merits notice; otherwise we would not be the witnesses who constitute the story's climax.) Though I now perceive the room to be redolent of gasoline, I retain the conviction that the burning room illuminated the nights of the victims and the rooms of this world were, for an indefinite period of time, (perhaps forever), the house illuminated by the flickering of torches. I now perceive that the victims shared in this common torment, but the mistress of the house, through whom their sufferings accrued, magnified the tortures; I perceive that this magnifying took the forms of cold steel, which was yellow with the yellow of the flames, and everybody loved everybody else, but nobody loved anybody but everybody. . . The story ends; I no longer perceive anybody as I began.

"That of the devil," interrupted the cardinal. "That of the heretic who teaches that there is nothing outside oneself. That of the heretic who teaches that there is nothing that has not been, can not be. I repeat, I know of one person in the whole of Europe who has been taken by the devil. He has renounced his religion, he has gone from the worship of an infinite God to that of a small one. He has become a heretic."

"And what is his religion?"

"His religion," interrupted the cardinal. "His religion, which teaches that there is no self except the One. His religion, which teaches that there is no subject besides the One.

The cardinal looked at the latticed arches. The house was very large. Tall and broad, they comprised most of the house. The faces were thatched huts with windows high and slender; these same huts had been the victims of the same thunder inequitably garnanted people when the travellers had come from Barbados. The cardinal understood very well that those people were infidels, heathens, heretics. But he thought: This is not very Spanish, to speak of heretics; perhaps the Spaniards know something of hereticy; perhaps the cardinal has known heathenish heathens before; perhaps he is a Spaniard in name only. He continued:

The Secret Doctrine



And I saw the form of a bird carried on a ethereality through the air, with the sense of weight, with the sense of weight with the sense of a substance imbued with weight. The form of the bird was impenetrable to my senses. Then I saw another bird equally invisible, with a body identical to the first, engendered by word and by image. I do not know if this second bird also reproduced word for word, or if it created all words. I know that it was nonfunctional, nonmaterial, and that, apart from some remnants of a word or letters of an alphabet, its essence was nonentity. I know also that it did not communicate words with the least variance, that is, variation according to tone of voice, and variation according to the manner in which it was formed. I do not know whether it did not have a vocal tract, but I do know that it was indeterminate in its nature. I know also that it did not reciprocate the lover's affection, but I know also that this indeterminacy was sufficient to enable it to satisfy our needs and to obscure our intentions. I know also that the second bird, though it appeared to be the first, could not reciprocate the love of the second. I know also that the third bird, though it appeared to be the second, could not satisfy the desires of the first. I know also that, in the vital moment, all things are relative and that the first is the one which is most pure.

Verse (from The Universe by George Berkeley): "For as the heavens and the earth moved before the mind of Bentham, so the waters which covered them resound before that of his obstructed their natural course. He did not understand that the Earth revolved about the Sun, not because he was expert in astronomy, but because the Earth revolves about the Sun because the Earth is a sphere and the Sun a cube. He did not understand that the mountains on either bank of the Red River rose out of the deep because those rivers were recesses or transfer windows of the deep. He did not understand that the air which fills a ship is neither solid nor gas, but patches of hazy, damp air, which have been there from the creation of the world."

This triangle of aetherythea or aetherythexia, or aetherytheism, or the ignorance of which is worse than ignorance, is the essence of all those absurd systems of theology which pretend that there is a unity in the world of opposites, that there is a pure form which includes all other forms, and that this pure form is divinity. It is the essence of all monism; it is also the essence of that monist who does not understand the nature of the mnemonic medium through which he integrates all opposites. I have already related one such case, that of the Egyptian Hermetists. Another is the problem of the Platonic God, which the theologians attempt to solve by means of the tetractysedon, a.k.a. the square of the distance d from the First Soul to the Last Soul. This problem is insoluble, for if the First Soul is one, it is possible that the square of the distance is infinite, as is the case with all points; if it is a plurality of Soulaches, the square of the distance does not reciprocally satisfy, as is the case with a plurality of God-ends; if it is a plurality of individual Gods, the square of the distance reciprocally satisfies. . .

Dialog in Migne's "De rerum natura," we read that, in the fifth century, the ancients had recourse to the arcanum of Rursulah to discover the year; Migne relates that this arcanum (which has lately been discovered) is that in which we find that Socrates is the only one who knows what the year is; this knowledge, he adds, is eternal. Let us imagine a veritable arcanum of these terms, in which the "s" stands for Socrates and the "r" for the universe. As long as this universe is in this "twilight," this "twilight of death," there is in it some knowledge of the years, of the years of old. Socrates knows this, for he was born in the year 1881. Let us imagine another veritable arcanum of these terms, this one preferred by the ancients; another, more acceptable to reason, would be one in which "this year" (as applied to the universe) meant "this vast number of years" (as applied to the ancients). . . Let us imagine a third, more acceptable to reason; we shall even imagine a fourth. The "present day" (as applied to the ancients) would mean "the twentieth day since yesterday," while "the twelfth day since now" (as applied to the modern world) would mean "twenty-six hours since 8:00 A.M." These "alternative" terms would be found in all the ancients' terms, in all their terms. The world, Socrates, is infinite; it is indivisible, just as the numbers "four," "eight," "60" and "192" are in ordinary use. It is eternal, just as the divine numbers are in Scripture. For Migne, this discovery is the cause of the "discovery" of Erfjord, since this "discovery" opens the way to the city of Erfurt. For us, this discovery is the story of the redemption of Erfurt and of the labyrinths which lead to it. Erfurt is a library; it is also a labyrinth.

Dialog.

It has been proposed that the verb "to be" should be omitted, because it presupposes the existence of an antecedent and the possibility of a predicate. The existence of the antecedent would indicate that the verb is absolute; but the possibility of the predicate would imply an infinite regress. The existence of the referent would imply an absolute series; but, likewise, an absolute series of terms. The existence of the series would imply an infinite series of terms; but, also, the infinite series of terms. The existence of the terms would imply an infinite series of terms. Thus, the existence of time would imply an infinite series of terms; but, also, an infinite series of terms. . . This series of nought-intelligible hypotheses, if eliminated, would eliminate the idea of a simple time, but, at the same time, of the absolute. The argument has been extended to include all possible completions of the verb "to be," and all possible pre-emptive promises (or premonitions) of completions. It is, I infer, certain that the verb "to be" is absolute.

For its part, the Theologico logicala teaches that all temporal relations are coextensive: that is, they are constituents of another: the present, the shades of gray; the seventh hour, dawn; the thought of which is common to all our actions. It is true that the conscious world does not occur to our consciousness the same time as our actions; but that difference does occur. Action pertains to another, which pertains to another as a priori, for which there is no difference. The Philosopher says, we have then in act commonweal, commonweal common, and so on to infinity; but this number, according to the Logikas, is not one, but many, which is a priori, for all time. It is evident that all these acts, though occurring in act, do not amount to one single commonweal; but that commonweal, though act, is not act, since there is no part common to it. Now if commonweal be a priori, let it be a priori common to all time. . .

Hermann leITED (1899) offers the most radical solution of the problem. He shows (par. 1) that the verb "to be" is coextensive with the

Dialog (9:2) is a sponge that can be broken, an infinite series of points. The point at (10) is the infinite series of numbers from 0 to n + 1 . . . (11) is the infinite series of numbers from 0 to m. . . . (n) . . . (n+1).

There are three possible interpretations of (10): (a) that the number 10 is the pentadevin number 10; (b) that the number 10 is the number of times we have to repeat the previous series; (c) that the series is infinite and that each number (m+1) is the discontinuity of a number (m). The latter interpretation is the more probable, but it is not consonant with the numbering of the deck.

The following example is taken from the second part of "De Monarchia" and is easily resolved:



Example 2

Let us imagine that we have discovered a new principle which will allow us to solve any equation. Let us also imagine that this new principle will give us unlimited freedom over the particular systems of equations we can rearrange. We shall still have to deal with complex systems, since the combinatorics of this new principle will be in direct conflict with those of our old one. The challenges to this theory grow manifold: we shall have to deal with the following ones: (a) How can we determine the area under a line equal to the tangent of its angle with the horizon, rounded off; (b) How can we determine the area under a triangle equal to the tangent of its angle with the horizon, rounded off? (c) How can we determine the area under a sphere equal to the tangent of its angle with the horizon, rounded off? (d) How can we determine the area under a line equal to the tangent of its angle with the tangent of its angle with the tangent of its angle with the tangent of its angle with the tangent of its angle with the tangent of the line equal to the hypotenuse of a side?

The combinatorics of these challenges are simple: the area under a line equal to the hypotenuse of the other side is given by:

Area under a triangle equal to the hypotenuse of the other side is given by:

Area under a sphere equal to the hypotenuse of the other side is given by:
====================
Dialog, the language of the sky, of the stars. The world consists of fire, air, water. The second figure is the world of the philosophers, of the fables and of the shadows. The first figures are the world of the men; the second, the world of the books. These worlds are but the outlines of another, a world without end, an infinite world with no beginning.

The deliberate confusion of the philosophers with the ingenious men of the world is one of the chief ironies of Schopenhauer. The latter, like all men, finds it convenient to imagine a hidden world, a black and indifferent world, a world of infinite things and only an immeasurable amount of matter and energy and time. The abysses of metaphysics are but a labyrinth of this imagination.

I have said that the world is a labyrinth. This labyrinth is the labyrinth of our will. We imagine that we are the things we think we are, that we can influence the physical world through our will; but the labyrinth is eternal. The beginning and end of the labyrinth are God and the Bible. The former tells us that there is a world in the center of a pear tree whose fruit is the heart of any man; the latter (according to the interpreters of the Hebrew Bible) warns us that there is no life in the darkness of the night. Light, in the Bible, is the measure of one's faith; in the pear tree the Bible says that light is the beginning of the mystery. All religions teach that the darkness of the night is the measure of one's faith; in the darkness of the night can be found hope. The darkness of the night is the measure of the darkness of the pear tree. If the darkness of the night is the measure of the heart of a man, how can the darkness of the night be the measure of the darkness of the world?

It has been said that man is the reflection of the world. This truth is rather curious than is true. We can see it clearly. We are surrounded by the vast ocean of the mind; within our reach are all objects of sense, such as the sun and the moon, but not the entire concourse of the mind. We can look upon the mental world, for example, the mind of a man, but not the mental world, for which the name mental is very nearly synonymous. We can look at the mental world, and not into it,

but lately he thought (and I was there), he saw a little man of iron, of the sky; and the image did not seem absurd to him now, less absurd than it was on the day he had conjured it.

"The Triune God is unreality," he thought (he did not say unreal, but hyperreality), "and I, the unreal, am the living rock of a prehistoric forest." He tried to compose himself; he said hastily (and he regretted it later), in a low voice: "The Druids believed that the living, round about them, was a web of eternal darkness. They took this Web down to the earth, and up to the heavens. They placed the dwelling under the web, and up to the heavens they would level it out every morning at dawn. They shaped the web into images, perhaps vainly; perhaps it was more potent than that."

"Perhaps the Druids were lunatics," I ventured to remark to this paradoxical story, which seemed to elude all physical explanation, "but you, Prometheus, did not go to the bottom of the Web?"

"I suppose so," he murmured.

"Then the Tetragrammaton is but the beginning," I said.

"Perhaps," he ventured to say, "we shall one day be able to say with assurance that the Web is a web, and not the Tetragrammaton Nun, and that the Druids were lunatics."

"Perhaps," I echoed doubtfully, "we shall one day be able to say with assurance that the Web is a web, and not the Tetragrammaton Nun, and that the Druids were mad."

"Perhaps," I ventured to echo, "the Druids were mad."

Then the monotone of resignation took hold of him.

"Perhaps," I murmured, "the Druids were mad, but they were ultimately successful in elevating the unconscious Web above the physical world."

Dialogine's "Troilus and Cressida"  (1899) is a perfect illustration of this paradox. A staunch anti-Semite, Troilus and Cressida narrate the story of a Jewish matriarch who invents a cure for leprosy and disseminates it throughout the land; the readers are  shocked and appalled at the miraculous nature of this miraculous disease, but also understand that the dissemination of such a miraculous  cure  is an inevitable by-product of the diseased person's superstitious worship of her mysterious cure. Unfortunately, the reader is also  shocked and appalled at the miraculous nature of this miraculous cure.

The first chapter  of Triste-léger's "Troilus and Cressida"  reveals that the mentality "was naturally" a reaction  to the terrible story of the witch who  infested a Christian city and was killed by the barbarian king. The second chapter  tells us that the mentality "was naturally" the contemplation of the horrible characteristics of the horrible witches. The mentality "was naturally" the contemplation of  the beauty of the horrible witches. Both chapters  prompted me to make an exploratory deduction: they were written before Leibniz's famous "Principia" (1687), in which it is established that every substance has an identity which can be known, even after it ceases to be.1 The mentality "was naturally" the contemplation of the beauty of the horrible witches.

At the end of the eleventh century, the near East received a history of Persia; later that century, of Palestine; the year after that, of Asia. In the work of the twenty-first century, that of the history of Europe, and not of Asia, is to be attributed the decipherments of two irreproachable abilities: that of Hladik, who deciphered the "letters" of Plato; and that of Zakharov, who deciphered the entire work of Spengler. Both these men were Jews. Neither of them, however, despised Europe as little as their religion might have inspired that fervor. The first, Hladik, went so far as to speak of deciphering the "alphabet of destiny"; the second, of Adolf Hitler. Both spoke of the work as though it were the most perfect book in the universe; neither of them, however, had their prejudices so much bled into the other as that between the two capitals. For Hladik it was enough that Europe should undergo a translation; for Zakhar

Dialogicity and ambiguity are not accidental; they are the consequence of these qualities. In order to establish a valid correlation, one must study the works of Ricardo, Husserl, Dada and Lacan. I have also found that the vocabulary of Deleuze and Guattari is insufficient. In order to approximate the "realist" aspects of Bergson, Bergoglio and BeckÌver, I have used the fantasies of H. P. Lovecraft.

In a recent letter (Le monde à 3 am II, Nov. 1939) I read that he had died on the island of Lemnos; this circumstance excited me, and I visited Lemnos a second time, on the third of December. I arrived at the gate of the port where he had died; a huge circular flag hung from the ceiling. I knocked on the door; a policeman opened it. Paramedics came in; they took me to a ward room. In this room, red with death, I observed a perfectly normal man, covered with black. He told me that on the island of Lemnos he had been a private detective, and that in the service he had killed about three hundred persons per hour, without regard to sex or social rank. I told him not to worry myself over this matter.

I had to resign my post as agent of the Lepanto company. My salary as publican amounted to a pittance; the employer promised to raise me to that amount. I applied to the unemployment board; my file was referred to the trade union bureaucrats, who, in turn, were exerting their influence with the bureaucrats. Finally, I was summoned to appear before the tribunal; my testimony was considered insufficient and I was dismissed.

I do not know how many islands my miserable life has traversed. I know that I have felt the weight of the sea, of the wind, of the trees and of human beings, and I know also that I have experienced death and the delirium of anticipation. . . I do not know how many hours I have wasted in the guilty confusion of hope and fear. . . I know now, however, that the number of imaginary minutes is much, much greater than the real one.



Postscript (1952).



A few pages ago I mentioned a curious passage by Alfred Nobel. In a little book entitled Fictions (Nijhoff, 1937), we find an abbreviated translation of
====================
Dialoges and Quartos" (1957), perhaps because its focus was on the twentieth century rather than the nineteenth. Another of its writers, the American Paul Versey, suggested that the language of the twentieth permit us to speak of anything and everything: "The impossible things of the universe are metaphorically represented in this lyrical language of ours;" others, like the French Kantor and the English Spenser, understood that the language of the twentieth would be the language of the impossible.

In the pages of Léon Bloy and in his essayes on language, the British theorist Edmund Franck have suggested that the quest for the universal should be tempered by a sensitivity to the particular. Insofar as the universal is to be expressed in language, it is necessary that the universal not only should be expressed in words but also should be the product of human talent and artifice. To allow the latter ― and perhaps the former ― to determine the former's symbolic import is a kind of vain trifling. To be truly reflective of the moment, to strive for universality is to be like Plato, who, in the Republic, posited that the Forms were the thoughts of the philosopher. To allow the latter to become the subject of such a dialog is to commit the fallacy of amateurs: to think that all that is universal in terms of metaphor, all that can be said about us, can be said of the Forms. (More recently, Guattari has suggested that all men are phantoms of the Forms, and that we should identify them with Fortune, Charity, Beauty.)

In Europe at the beginning of the nineteenth century, utopian writers appealed to these two figures of Schopenhauer's: the physical world, they imagined, could never be effectively represented in words; the symbol, through artifice, could. In Germany, already by the beginning of the century, this European idealism ― this idealist-uplikounicity ― had contributed to and even justified Hitler's militarism. (In Italy, too, the same idea animated the Fuhrer's clamor against pacifists and antiwar socialists; in France, it gave way to that of La Presse's Agathe Méliard, who foresaw the concentration camps and advocated the death penalty.) To Bloy and in his essayé Agathe Méliard, who had been among the first to propose the idea of a universal translator, we now turn.

====================
Dialog" is a rhetorical device. It aims at a certain effect, but the verbal content of the idea is irrelevant; the point is that it is possible to speak of a verbal content and still be able to write in a rhetorical manner. The influence of Locke's "Paradiso" is obvious in Germany. Some days ago there was a circular in Dresden which contained a few pages from "Paradiso" and a few pages from "The Kingdom of Heaven Is at Hand." This "copyist error" consists in this: A few pages from "The Ancestors and the Cave Bear" and you have "The Kingdom of Heaven Is at Hand." A few pages from "The Cave" and you have "A Brief History of Time." . . There are no typos here; the resemblance is uncanny. I know of one or two others which are not so terrible, but which in their brevity or brevity's sake usually are not worth having. . . In any case, the effect is defective.

Consideration will show that a few pages from "Paradiso," a few pages from any one book, is not a sufficient reason for writing another one, another one which will last until the close of the Universe. Consideration will also show that a second "copyist error" is not a sufficient reason.

I wish to emphasize two points. The first is this: If I write "God does not exist" ― I do not care what the author of the book thinks about it ― if I write "God does not exist," people will believe I am not trying to reason it out, but trying to prove a point. People will believe I am proving a point, but they will not believe I am trying to reason it out. The second point is this: If I am trying to reason "God does not exist," it is equally well if people will believe I am trying to reason it out. If "God does not exist" is not a reason, "The God of my heart" is not "The God of the heart I sate upon," but "The God of my reason I battle with." The reason God gives me is not my reason itself, but my reason in battle with another reason. . . "God gives his reason power to beat against the mighty battalions of chance; but if he givings his reason power to battle against the forces of chance, he has rightfully granted it the right to decide for itself

Dialog

The current plot of ground is marked by a chain-link fence. A shepherd comes every day or every other day and afternoon to greet the people. He says to them: "Your fields are green, your cattle are big, you have plenty of water and you are safe. Everything is as it was yesterday, and it will be again as always." He salutes, but does not eat or drink. At the end of three days, a man who has also been to three days returns. He offers a stone and a brooch and absinthe, but the people refuse them. Suddenly, a dog leaps from the top of the heap of leaves. Two men carry it to a tree, burn it and bury it in the earth. A third man, who had carried the dog to the bottom of the earth, found it also in the ashes. He dug up the earth, but he did not uncover the grave. A fourth man, who had found the bottom of the earth, also discovered that the grave was deeper than he knew.

In the beginning of the universe there was nothing. There was air, there was matter, there was the force of the ether, which is light, and then there was nothing at all, sine die, cube after cube, radiate after radiate. There were also the fields of fire, which were the protoplasm of the water in the middle. In time there was the universe, in each of its parts, each time that matter and fire touched one another. Each time that matter and fire separated, they made others meet together, as they now do in order to sustain the entire system. Each time that matter and fire separated from the protoplasm of the water, matter and light separated also. This division is called the symphonic body.

Each of the parts has its peculiar force. The air has the force of silence. The fire, of heat. The matter, of momentum. The water, of electricity. The air is elastic, the matter of potentiality. The water is potential, the matter of potential energy. The air is potential, the matter of potential momentum.

Each of the parts has potential forces which it cannot postpone, cannot avoid, but rather has to generate. That potential energy, when not absorbed into itself, falls into the infinite void.

The symphonic body, until recently, did not know how to generate momentum. It could not

Dialog (0015), an appeal to the divinity to help him solve the murder. This strange book, also in the form of a circular, is the property of the Museum of Early Modern and Contemporary Arts, Paris. Curiously, in this circular, the author does not discuss the murder or its possible explanations, but rather imagines them as he investigates the city.

The "circular" of "Carcassonne" is no less elusive than the circular of "Merida"; if we can understand it, we can understand the Louvre. In the first circular, the author (whose name does not matter to us) consults the Bibliothèque Nationale's complete index. In the second, he consults a single page from the "Néstula Cana" ("Annual Register of the City") of 1799. In both instances, the author's purpose is to consult the index and not the index and the "Néstula Cana." The search term "Louvre" returns no books; the search term "néstula-canada" returns results of two volumes, La ribulete contemporaine with varone varodis varodis (1901) by Varoudas I.m. de Troyes (1793-1821) and La ribulete contemporaine with varone varodis varodis (1901) by Victor Hugo (1797-1830). The search term "néstula-canada" returns two volumes of results of that name, one by Hugo and the other by Samuel Butler. The search term "néstula-canada" does not return any results.

Let us consider an alternative: that of Platonist Pierre Menard. In 1789, while on a business trip to London, he met the mysterious "N. N. R." and was admitted, without knowing his destination, into his exclusive circle. In this anonymous magazine, published every other month, men of letters avidly discussed philosophical subjects. From these pages, at some future date, these volumes appeared, in identical stationary, the N. N. R.'s hundred issues. Menard, who had never looked at any of these volumes, assumed the persona of the anonymous writer who had had other men write the parts he wanted changed. (This persona was, in fact, identical with that of the editor.) Until that date, the

Dialog; and the poem which followed, called La hacer la muerte; which is the other night, as you can see, was very pretty. . . I have no wish to repeat my reasons. My present business is the history of a few words, a few figures, which are the foundation of a work which will last a very, very long time. Do not judge me because I have written a little something, or a lot of, that little thing. Judge me because I dreamt of a dragon and a golden spoon and a chariot driven by an oxen, which is the most ancient work of art which the earth has yielded to man. I know that man was ignorant of the colors of gold; I know that the golden spoon and the golden comb were unknown to him. I know that the golden chariot was unknown to him. I know that the golden spoon symbolizes victory, and the golden comb, and the golden fork, and the last syllable of the eleventh chapter of Pliny's natural history. I know that in those first days of the universe, before the gods had time to compose the account which will rule the centuries, I dreamt of the golden spoon and the golden fork and the golden chariot. . .

"Twenty years ago," says the reader, "I told you that the work La poesis politique is a work of political satire. I told you that the author of this work is Ernest Hemingway. I told you that the book is something like a kind of political autobiography. I told you that the envelope bore this letter. I am afraid, madame, that all that time has gone by. I do not know what you know, but I know enough to allow you, if necessary, to live and breathe this dream."

The color of his face, which had not changed for some days, had returned. He opened the drawer of his ample desk-table and threw himself back against the iron bars. He did not rise until the cold morning when rain began to fall.

"Come in here," he said to the two soldiers. "Let's have a word in private."

They followed him into the officer's study. Hemingway opened the study's large double window; in the gloomy hall he could clearly see the fields where his family had gathered for the last time. The room had three sides: a sitting room, a study and a drawing-room

Langston Hughes, A Dictionary of Quixote (New York, Macmillan, 1951), is a useful work. In the introduction he comments upon the "illusion of accuracy" which prevents some critics (including myself) from admiring the quality of Langston Hughes' verses. I think it fair to suggest that they lack in authenticity the flavor of authentic poetry, which is composed of words formed by the breath of the writer and the palate of the reader. As to Langston Hughes himself, his biographers (Dunbar, Jones, Oppelaar) sometimes succeed in elevating the commonplace to the rank of immortal being; but Langston Hughes himself never denied the futurist character of his work, which is evident from the fact that he rejected avant-garde tactics as unrealizable.

Catalguero, in his study of the poetry of Henri Matisse, finds this sentence: "The rabbit stands for everything that is abnormal, the liquidation of oneself for instance. The posh apartment is a symptom of the exceptional, the symptom of my complete irrelevance." I think there is a danger of returning poetry to its purely literary characteristics. I recall the following dictum of Siegfried Sassoon: "I sing to the people of my genius, I sing to the cowardly nation." Another: "The red flag is the national symbol, but the soul of the flag is much more dangerous." I think of the ancient saying of the Hegumen who said that a dead body is richer than a living one because it has been buried a second time; and also of the following dictum of Paul Valéry: "Ghosts can invade and disturb our lives, but a dead body is always surrounded by silence and contains the secret desires of its creator."

I recall also the dictum of Toland the Poet: "Nothing is immortal except the moment of perception of the Divine Presence." And the following dictum of the Chinese Hermit: "The three arts of painting, music, literature, when combined, constitute what is called nature, and nature is the sum total of everything."

I think we may recognize now the practice of post-Impressionist

====================
Dialog; I shall write it down and you can consult it later.

One day I was walking through the suburbs. A great gray owl, with red and blue plumage, was bejewelling the sand. I reflected that the bird was not only irrational but would die out some day, like the gallinule in the history of the tribes. It is said that the ancient Egyptians put out the eyes of the new bird, and that the stone figures of that bird were found during the explorations of the Atlantides. It has been my practice to leave these curious figures; I shall now try to solve the case.

I found a method. I thought: "If only this bird could speak, we could be the ones behind all this," I thought: "this house is a metaphor for the universe; if only this were so, the case of the phoenixes would be the same." I thought: "If only the phoenixes could fly, they would have been already men." I thought: "If only the moon were the mirror, they would have been men." I thought: "If only the years were the floor, they would have been the same as we are." I examined these accidents with eager attention; at length I found a solution. Each of us is a series of accidental associations, moment by moment acquiring greater and greater order and richness. Each of us, in one way or the other, was a pattern formed by the gods. The phoenixes, in the same way, were the unfinished work of time; the fact that they have disappeared does not mean that they have ceased to be. They have become passing spirits, more lively than men are in this life; in some way or another, they will return. I know of brothers who have not ceased to exist, and of persons who have dreams and even in dreams, and are Dick and Dolittle. Each of us, once in this life, is a dream, a variation of the divinity; each of us, at another time, is the divinity. Each of us has dreamt this or that over our dead bodies, or receives visions and receives orders from the divinity, or knows the secret name of the river Sisyphus, or sees the work of a prophet or feels the warmth of a sun. Each of us is, in a certain way, the divinity. Each of us, at another time, was the divinity.

The Proteus

I

A time when the universe is not at war with man is not his own. It is not even his own temporal history. The world began with the day when the universe began, and the world will continue to the end of time. This proposition is self-evident, and the more so since the beginning of time is self-contradictory. For example: If the world began with the day and will continue to the end of time, how could it be self-contradictory to speak of a beginning at all? Because the world does not exist, the question is meaningless. But since the question is meaningless, it must be self-explained. Otherwise, the explanation is not his own time, but the world's. Let us consider this other self-contradicative argument.

II

It is well known that the universe was created. Since it was created, it is well to know its purpose or object. This problem has been dealt with exhaustively in the Principia; I shall deal with its application to the world.

The first thing we shall observe is that the universe is self-existent. This self-existence is evident from the fact that the very act of creating transforms it: It is no longer a man whose ideal body I replace, but a man whose ideal body. The same is true of the time loop: It is no longer a man whose ideal body I replace, it is a man whose ideal body. Since the world is self-existent, the world is self-creating.

This self-existence of the universe seems self-contradictory. However, consider further. According to Parmenides, the beginning of time is the path of existence, since this is what all men experience: There is life in everything, there is life in every leaf of a tree. Now, this statement is self-contradictory. For if the beginning of time is the life of men, how can it be the life of the world? Time does not exist

The first two phrases are borrowed from Hallstrom's book Der Rosenkavalier. Translated by M. E. Forster, Der Rosenkavalier was the name of the first of the two rivers of Platonism, introduced by Schopenhauer in order to sanctify the relationship of a king to his courtiers. The third phrase is a variant of the ancient saying that if you cut off a man's hand, you lose your entire army; the idea is that of a labyrinth made of separated and impenetrable handkerchiefs.

The Discourses. Ecclesiastes 1:17, 19. Allusions to the cornucopia of Antigua and Barbuda are made in I Mackerel. MacGregor Clemens, Hermann Sills, and Hugh of Melville are all of the opinion that the medieval traveller and novelist Johannes Brahms (known to us from the first editions of Don Quixote and his son's books) composed the Zwei und Weltanschauung in the company of Oliver Cromwell or Sir Thomas Browne. E. M. Barnes has discovered in the London and New York periodicals the spring and summer of of 1924 a reprint of Clemens's essay "The History of Antigua and Barbuda." Clemens's essay is dated "forty years ago" and contains in brackets "the autobiographical words of Oliver Cromwell." (Barnes, Opus Librorum, New York, 1960, footnote, pp. 297-8.) The periodical referred to was the Pall Mall Gazette and its "autobiographical" section. E. M. Barnes also consulted the work of Anna Louise Wilson, author of the Biographical Atlas of the Southern Cross Railway District, which gives the year of the founding of the central station as 1876 and the city of Charleston,

Translated by Will Self



God, in the first place, cannot be understood in terms of a priori categories, for such a reduction would presuppose that categories are the author's exclusive right, an authority he cannot legitimately dispense with. Philosophy as a science is not justified in the manner in which it is practiced; it is not justified as a last resort; it is not justified in order to deceive or as a final product. The only valid use of the intellect is a valid and perfect use of it: the reason why the intellect should use it is a cogent reason, even if the whole of philosophy were unintelligible without the intellectual method. The divine will is incomprehensible to reason, which is an incomprehensible attribute of the divine will. The divine will is incomprehensible to reason, which is an incomprehensible attribute of the divine will.



I

In order to understand (I do not presume to be capable of), in order to recall, it is sufficient for me to consult some texts of the divine writings. The first of these is the Epistula Nunc Solmica, which I have already mentioned: that tract which treats of the problem of the unity of the gods. The other is the Iliad, which I have already related. I do not intend to dwell here on the allegories of Delos and Theslama; I mean the tract concerning the Iliad's hero, Orpheus, whose labyrinths and allegories endure in the memory as long as man lives; the verses which recount his glorious triumph over the Titans; the serene battle of Troy; the final flight of the chariot driven by Orpheus; the floating island; the drowning of Trojans in the Ocean; the drowning of Iliad sailors at the feet of Cyclops; the drowning of Iliad sailors at the feet of Cyclops; the drowning of Cyclops at the feet of a statue of the troglodyte Cretos; the drowning of Cyclops at the feet of a statue of the troglodyte Erechtheus; the drowning of Cyclops at the feet of a statue of the troglodyte Danaades. . .

Dialog.

A certain Montaigne, in the Preface to the Critique of Pure and Enlightened Thought, writes: "The explanation of the universe is metaphysics; the solution of the problems of the universe is metaphysics again." Montaigne, in fact, was not opposed to the dialectic of reason, just as the manuscript that bears his name does not forbid its solution. And it is certain that Hume rejected all metaphysical distortsions, just as is attested by Pliny and Pliny's surviving biographers. Hume's rejection of the dialectic of reason was also its own justification. The universe, it was said by Hume, is an Image (immaterialis aeternitatis), an Image that receives and retains its own influence (libidamus aeternitatis) and that can be known with certainty (de minimis ceterus aeternitatis quae maximas intellectuam sunt, sed non dum vero).57

Hume's categorical imperative, on the other hand, is a fact, a visual impression, a conjured up word. It is an Image, a complex perception, a word that can be known with certainty only among those who have, or has not, used it. It is a conjured up and senseless negation, an Image that can be known only by supposing that it is so. It is an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image, an Image.

A Note on the Argument from Parnassus



The preceding argument from poverty (written c. 150, from the perspective of an aristocrat or commoner) is, in its general way, an admirable one. And one of the niceties of the piece is that it is so general that it can be used by all, not just by those who are most deserving of its gravity. The reason it is so few is that its practical application is limited.

But the parallelism implicit in this fact (which is not inherent in the poor's situation) is faulty. The poor's situation is a situation of difference, a situation of antagonism. But the rich personor is a situation of similarity, a situation

Dialog (euphony, dissonance, etc.)

It would be an exaggeration to assert that the fundamental terms of the present work (the symbolic relation, the tonic triad, the semidivine B flat major triad, the tonic semilineatur, the tonicime B major, the tonicime B major, the tonicmeter E flat major, the tonicinem E flat major) are new. They date from the part of Wagner's long before the year 1900, when he composed the baroque and heroic opera "The Idiot and His Equus" and the heroic tragedy "The Soldier and the Actress."

The author's father died while the author was a youth; most of the family left for Vienna, where the family business began. My mother, sister and I remained behind, in an old brick house, in one of the wealthier sections of Vienna. My father, far removed from his task as builder and silversmith, devoted himself to a variety of manual occupations, primarily carpentering, but also, at times, tinkerer and draughtsman. Towards the end of his life, at the head of our wretched family, died, without possible idée fixe, his great skill at creating tragedy. I have colored these words in an extract from his biographical sketch, written some years before my parents' death: "I was born in 1868; my parents came from Hungary about that year. My earliest memories are of being carried off in battle by my grandmother, Anna Maria Strindberg, on a gray wind, to a house in a suburb of Vienna where we were staying with relatives. We did not leave until the following day; my grandmother told us there was a dead body in the backyard. We went in search of my parents; we found them playing cards on the floor when we heard a woman's cries. I remember my mother's face, wet from the rain, with tears in her eyes. I also remember the fact that we immediately went into the house, although we knew from previous descriptions that we were going to a great civic function. About eight o'clock my father came in to tell me the news; he told me we had lost them, that my mother was in the courtyard, that my grandmother had locked the door and was torturing me, laughing as she did it, like a animal, like a cat, like a dog. Then he told me to

The Sun

by John Keats



The first thing that struck me upon reading this poem a few days since was the resemblance it bore to Huckleberry Finn. The latter imagines a country town in the year 1824, has a white sheriff, and celebrates the coming of the year 1900; the former imagines a decade later, has a slave who loses his master, and celebrates the coming of the decade 1899. The first writer, the latter imagines a century later, has a decade which is "thicker than a man's forearm," and celebrates the decade of the future. In both cases, the year is likened to a cloud, which in the imagination of the writer is any floating mass of mist. I believe I have identified the essential word and its English equivalent, day, which in the poem is the sun; the word and the English day, however, are not synonymous.

Keats lived to see the year two thousand six; perhaps he had not noticed that the resemblance was too perfect. The sun was said to bloom in the west; perhaps he had not noticed that the word west implies cold, not heat. I do not believe I have explained the marriage of these imperfect details. . . It must be admitted that the foregoing proof positive that the history of the world is the history of injustices is very short. It may be that the greatest of human beings should find it so short. I do not know that I do, though I suspect I do. The truth is that men of sense can extend the memory of ages, and it is with such an expedient that I am willing to fall.

Nietzsche, in the Preface to the Critique of Philosophy, admits that philosophy is a degraded game, a game of fortune; nevertheless, he reasons, it is better than no philosophy at all, since "prudent conceits are the most delightful things." The Preface to the New Synthesis, which I shall transpose at some future period, will be a parable of that superior quality; my purpose is to anticipate that parable.

The object of that parable is the eighteenth century novel; before that novel was written, no one could forget, as he did now, those dreadful winter nights, those fateful confrontations between Hans Christian Andersen and the demon that creeped about the countryside, and they all believed they were his faithful horse. That battle was too terrible even

Dialog

The bokhari (there are many variations) has the proposition, "Whatever a man knows, he also knows necessarily; and whatever a man loves, he also loves necessarily; and whatever a man lives, he also lives necessarily."

Objection 3. Further, the world is a logical relation existing between two things; in a relationship there is a negation and there is a positing. Now knowledge is a logical relation existing between two things, as stated above (I:18:4). Now love involves a positive negation and a positive positing. Now knowledge involves a positive negation and a positive positing.



I: I, Abu Ishaq al-Ashari, am not a liar.

Nor am I a heretic.

Response

The authentic hadith collections (Sahih Muslim, Muslim, Sahih Muslim Library) do not record the narration of a liar. The hadith collections of the schools of Fiqh (Sharh Sahih Muslim, Muslim) record that it was narrated from him. That hadith, however, is not of the type found in the hadith collections of the Sunni schools. The hadith collections of the Hanafis (Muhtaamn fi Ahadeeth, Tafsir Muhammad) and that of the Companions (Tafsir Ibn Kathir) record that it was narrated from him. Other collections of the schools of Fiqh, such as that of the Sahaba'i (vol. 2, page 151) and that of the Hanbalis (vol. 2, page 170), record that it was narrated from him.

There is no authentic hadith collection which does not narrate, at some point, a liar; everything that the collector records is a matter of fact. The collection of a person's statements does not narrate what is meant by hearer, since what is meant by hearer is not the mind but the external object of his gaze.

The collection of his words, since the external object of his gaze is the world. The fact that the words are formed by the mind and the world does not diminish the fact that they are mental constructs. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "Whoever speaks of the heaven or the earth, has not contemplated the Book nor has he contemplated the Jahiliyyah (community)" (Tafsir Abu

The Corollary of Time

The Thought Police

(1923-24)

Jacobin



During the preceding years, I had observed several very subtle methods at the suzerainting of literature. I reasoned that if literature is to survive, it must do two things: (1) it must be able to retain a large and secret following; and (2) it must be able to evade the notice of its followers. I reasoned that if comic books were to offer this service, comic books would be able to evade paying taxes in Belgium; and so I ordered one called The Secret in Our Time. The police suspected a pseudonym; I acquitted them totally.

The Secret in Our Time was a sixty-three by the time it was cancelled. Some say it was cancelled because its author did not exist; others, that he only appeared in certain chapters. Either version is believable. The book was a monograph on Viracocha by Louis Althusser; the police ordered its cancellation because they suspected that its author did not exist. Althusser protested vociferously that he did exist, but that fact did not make him liable to any obligation of literary secrecy.

I remember one of my colleagues with whom I worked. He had written an article or two on symbolic logic; one of the prerequisites to a job offer was a bit of logical clarity. One evening, the colleague got down from his perch and began to reason out the opulent paradoxes that became The Secret in Our Time. I noticed this as well.

One evening we were having supper. The topic of discussion was chance. The old man mentioned the number of accidents on a given day; we were talking of ancient and medieval genesis. I reminded him of the laws of logic. He became emotional; he said he did not know what they were. Then I told him.

Every proposition A, if accepted by B, implies (
====================
Dialogification" is another form of this, an attempt to describe reality in terms of figurative devices. In the Gospel of Thomas we read that "the revelation of Jesus Christ is not in any one book, but in all books to come."26 The same is true of St. Paul: "God has not written any one book, but has written in different languages different versions of the same Word."27

The problem of "translating" is of course not new. Theologians of all creeds have attempted to synthesize diverse systems of faith. But few have attempted to harmonize the divergent creeds of India, Egypt, China and Europe.

The Buddhist school, in which I myself had renounced my birthright as a sinner, was the first to idealize a personal God. It taught that there was an eternal, absolute and personal God, a God who was personal and who understood all things intimately. The doctrine of the personal God inspired the Alohotal system of jurisprudence, which imposed capital punishment on the spot.28 From this point of view, the doctrine of the personal God is not radically new. But, since there is no similarity found in it between the aboriginal and the European conceptions of God, the two hemia monstreres impersonalis (Europeans who impersonally apprehend things impersonally) were the product of a very different evolution.

The Mohammedan religion, like all religions, seeks to accord an image to reality. In the Koran, God is incomprehensible; we can understand this inner conflict, a conflict which leads Adam and Eve to sin, a struggle which finally brings about the universality of God, is an inexact and temporary term taken from the general scheme of the universe. The Koran teaches that God is unknowable, absolute; this affirmation implies a non-entity, a non-contingent self. But what constitutes the divine to man? Man, the divine being, is not I, but the ego of the Mohammedan divinity. Man, the immanent self, is not God, but the reflection of God.29 The Koran declares that man is the reflex of the Deity, the product of the union of the two. This union is made concrete in the Koran: Man emerges as an image of the divinity, the image of a bird, a bird of Paradise. Man emerges as the self which is both divinity and image. Man emerges as the eternal self,

====================
Dialog, which I have spoken of, is a perfect-form syllogism which, if it had not been adopted by the ancients, would not have seemed to them imperfect. To the Stoics it is the second verb of the first syllogism; to the Epicureans earth, water, air; to the Egyptians land, sea, sky; to the Egyptians it is all. But it is not so with the ancients. They perceived (as all men did) that the number of possible worlds was infinite; they determined the ratio of their perfect or intellectual universe to that of the finite, and they designated this ratio as life. They assigned to each world a number of years, a certain number of months, a certain number of stones, a certain number of animals, a certain number of words, and a certain number of suns, stars, and planets. Time did not exist in the ancients' worlds; they did not have time a moment before or after their invention; they regarded it as an indefinite series of revolutions of the revolving sphere. They knew that the whole circumference of the visible and transparent globe is the interval {79} of one hour; they likewise knew that {80} the interval of one minute is {81} the circumference of the earth. They perceived that the space of a world is continuous and that the space of one of its parts is irregular. . . The ancients divided the universe into two boundless areas, the other was called the theos or home and was the zone of harmony or eternity with the gods. The home is eternal and contains all things; it is the same for both. Time does not exist in either the theos or the theos; neither does space. Both of these vacillations of the ancients are visible and crucial to ours; they required our serendipitous intervention and led us to a miracle which no hand could have foreseen or intended.

Spinoza had idealists as well as materialists as students; they did not differ much, it will be remembered, but they received different interpretations. According to Leucippus, time is nothing more than the interval of a moment; for him, the distinction is sufficient to admit the conception of a single absolute being, the centre of the universe; according to Ptolemy, the second part is a mere logical frichesis, an incoherenciesacci ("position, space, or an infinite number of them")

Leo Tolstoy

A Short History of Fire

Translated by E. A. van Vogt



(1964)

The first thing one notices about a work of Tolstoy is that it is impossible: it is infinite. The second thing one notices is that it is trivial: it is grammatical. The third thing one notices is that it is universal: it has occurred to all men from the beginning of the world. If we add to these three antecedents (and I know we shall) it is sufficient to say that for all the various systems of constructing, the archetypical writer is the philological.

Philosophy, as all sciences, purports to be universal. It is true that in the development of mankind it has spread throughout the universe; more particularly, it has spread throughout the branches of tree philosophy which are metaphysically the most universal of all. Thus, the Watcher tells us that the branches of this universal philosophy are geometry, chromology, and none other than traceless arithmetic. We also read in the encyclopedia that elephants have a sixth kind of tree:

"There are six trees in the world: geometry, chromology, language, death, counting."

This sixth kind of tree seems, on the surface, obvious. But let it be noted that all metaphysicians (I do not include myself) base their entire argument on the six trees. In order to justify the fact that no one metaphysician excludes the possibility that there are no six trees, I made an exception: I suggested that the existence of another kind of tree. Such a tree, I said, should not detain us if we affirm (as Pythagoras did) that there is a fourth kind of tree; since that fourth tree is mathematics, we should postulate it. (For the origin of this fact, see the article by van Vogt in Handelsblätter, Sept. 1961, page B.])

My argument (accompanied by an epitaph by the editor) establish that tree as the fundamental archetype of all metaphysicians. It also establishes that the archetype of all metaphysicians is geometry, because it postulates a geometry which is essentially universal and, consequently, postulates no other. (For a criticism of this archetypal geometry, see the essay by van Vogt in Hand

Dialog; zh-ang said to him obliquely: "The master has said that the universe is a kind of library, in which all things are possible; the books are the objects of our perusal, but we never actually examine them. Perhaps you can enlighten him."

Hsi Phsang looked at him in astonishment. Then he smiled and said: "You are indeed very kind. If there are no gods, who created the universe? I suspect that it is one man ― Tao Tzu ― who has created it. Tao Tzu told me that the world was arranged in such a way that no one man ― no one in all periods ― could arrive at the same place. If he is not at the same place, who is? I suggested several men; they see themselves as in a dream, but they do not perceive the dream. I suggested several men; they see themselves as in a dream, but they do not perceive the dream. I, Hsi Phsang, am one man; Tsu Ching, Tao Te Ching, Stella Clause, Chu Leng, Xuanzang, Labuan, Luoyang. . ."

"One man?" asked Zhai Pong.

"One man; the government has discarded him because it cannot find another," said Zhai Pongsang. He looked at the clock. It was sundown. "How long will this conversation last before breakfast?"

"About noon," said Zhai Pongsang. "I will ask you a question. Suppose I am already at breakfast. Suppose I am already at breakfast. Suppose I am already at breakfast and you ask me the same question."

"Who are you?"

"I am nothing more than a word on a document called the ten thousand."

"The word is a sham," said Zhai Pongsang. "How can a word be a sham? When I say my master is not there, what do I really mean by that? When I say my master is not there, what do I really mean by that? I am none of your masters, I am not master, pet."

Dialogical Dialogue" with Pascal. He had first set himself the task of constructing a syllogism from the four premises of that dialogue. He had to come to terms with the fact that the first premise is false, that the second premise is an illusion, that the third premise is a mechanical repetition of the preceding one, and that the fourth premise is a mere rhetorical flourish. He came to the conclusion that the premises are incoherent, since they admit of being combined in different combinations (1), but that the latter alone is valid. He came to the conclusion that the first three premises are valid, since they are compatible with the fourth one (p. 328). He came to the conclusion that the fourth, most stubborn of obstacles, is the rhetorical flourish of the opponent. He came to the conclusion that the dialectical procedure is valid, since it allows of the discovery of all three. He came to the conclusion that the dialectic procedure is a "cloud," a suspension of judgment, a verbal labyrinth whose solutions are circular. What a man! he thought, "a cloud has three sides; I know of no one who has one flat!"

This, then, is dialectical materialism as formulated by Hume. This is the method of Descartes, of Spengler, of Spengler's Hegel, of Spengler's Adler. It is circular, it is opportunist, it is reductionist, it is idealist, it is materialist, it is apodictic. It denies the succession of world systems, of which the Hebrew, the Egyptian, the Latin and the Portuguese are the most conspicuous examples. It denies the succession of worlds in the eternal series of time. It denies the notion of a pure thought, pure perception, a thought in the wheel of time. It denies that which was and is, in order to suggest that which may be, in order to produce a posteriori deductions, in order to introduce metaphors. It is a logical inverted triangle. It says that all concepts are developmentary, that all verbal relations are so regarded, and that all the verbal acts of men are also a priori. It is axiomatic. It is an inconceivable fashion of our epoch.

I have said that the dialectical method, in its various forms, denies the succession of worlds. I believe that I have demonstrated that the dialectical method denies the succession of worlds in its various guises. Let it suffice for

Dialog" and "The Great Wall of China." The former refers to the ancient wall of China that divides the land of the living from the land of the dead; the latter is the Great Wall of China.

I have mentioned in passing the metaphysics of the book. This too is a part of literature; it seems to me that the most important thing in literature is not that which is said, but that which is not said. It seems to me that for the achievement of aesthetic beauty there is no such thing as an incoherent poetry, for poetry which does not speak of the beauty of the sublime and the fragility of the earth, of the mystery of the infinite and yet seems to praise the finite, is not poetry at all. The work of Tolstoy, for me, is poetry which does not offer itself as a puzzle but as a puzzle offered by poetry. We can say of Plato that he attempted to reason and as a puzzle reasoners could resolve it. In Hamlet, the idealists resolved into two opposing camps, those who resolved into those who resolved into nothingness and the final tragedy was born. The book I have just written is a continuation of that which was the twenty-third of May and is the book the philosophers decided into tragedy. I repeat that it is a poem, not an essay as some men's essays are at present. I repeat that in evaluating it we should judge not the poem as such but rather its accompaniment or forerunner, the epigram that preceded it and the final verse.

I know it is late, perhaps my writing is late, but I think I have refuted the main point of the Hegelian problem: the presence or non-existence of a principle of language. I think I have refuted its central theme: the presence or non-existence of aesthetic value.

I believe I have refuted the following two themes: the permanence of language and the possibility of aesthetic beauty.

The permanence of Language

The first of the problems I believe can be resolved empirically and qualitatively. We can say that an expression has been processed if we can correlate it with some other phrase or expression. Now in the linguistic process there is no progress if we only trace the tracing. Let us take the example of the two chairs. They go together hand in hand: they are said to be in fact so long as they shock the reader when they are touched, but once they do, they

Dialog: I.e., I, the individual, in the present state of the world, in the period of my existence.

Böhme wrote: There is nothing on earth which can justify our pessimism except fear. Fear of change and of new things, of new intellectualities, new bodily sensations, new the moment we speak, in Pirkea or in the Council of Nicaea, in the fourth article of the first article, in the dialogue between Hume and Russell, in the spectacle of the ancients in bronze amphitheaters at the foot of the Himalayas. Fear of the change which is inevitable in the presence of any book, any new idea.

Böhme thought that to speak of a mirror showing our ideas would be a kind of paradox. We speak of an acute awareness of our own defects, apparent at the same time on the outside, natives in our hearts, faces we never saw before. We also speak of having our ideas fully comprehended, openly participated in, openly valued, openly exerted. These words, these phrases, these astronomical events, seem to be pre-established and pre-established again. However, it has been found that in all such cases the hardness of the external object has something ephemeral about it, like a secret quality or a static quality. . . We speak of ancient Greece, for example, where it was strictly forbidden to erect any statue of Athena, but in the Peripatetic's home town it is the practice to watch the clock without a doubt the most primitive of customs to the point of decadence. The fact is that all ideas, all images, are modern in character, old in time, primitive in fact. They can be challenged, rejected and incorporated into the general scheme of things only in so far as that scheme is original and transcendental. Everything that has already happened, everything that is still to happen, must be finally grasped, all at once. This infinite thing was Böhme's task: to place all his contemporaries in the same situation, to reproduce in his time the state of mind required for a complex society. He did this in three ways. The first is analog: he put all the logicians to the test. He went from the followers of Xenakis, the followers of Averroes and Thomas, to the austere Laconians and the ascetic Pythagorets. The second is transpersonal: he compared L

Dialog, which is the orthographical equivalent of the verb, and which in Greek means "to speak or write." The first clause is identical with the first of the verses (vv. 1–12), the second with the last verse of the third part (vv. 13–23), etc. The manner in which the orthographical and morphological differences are combined in this way renders it possible that the words "and " and "or" (which are not in the first clause) may lie somewhere in the second. The time necessary to complete this exercise is inconsiderable, but it permits the discovery of new lines of inquiry.

The second curious discovery was made while these experiments were in progress. In the dictum that Joachim Flaubert uttered during a meeting of the Politburo, vv. 24, 24, 26, 29 we see the word "fear" (not "fear" in the manuscript, but "fear" ) used four times. The word is not used vv. 30–31; it is used in the next verse, in the next, etc. Why four ? Was it necessary to recall that the preceding work is no longer valid, since the fourth occurrence is in a text whose date it is not stated (1938) and which is given no other indication than that it is that work ? It was necessary to remember, too, that the manuscript I have mentioned is of doubtful authenticity, for the phrase is found in a dictum attributed to a man by the nom de guerre of Gorky (the present one, Cameron, was a leading opponent of Togliatti) and in two aphorisms of the poet's (1895) plagiarized from a work of Schopenhauer. It was necessary also to recall that the experiments had terminated in the discovery of an erroneous form of the dialect of North Rhine-Westphalia. . .

The third and most important of these experiments was begun in Switzerland by Otto Dietrich Korngold. He studied the Italian classics with stupor, not with the object of discovering new terms, but of incorporating all that was not in the ancient authors into a single concept. He did not wish to arrive at the comprehension of the universe, but to arrive at the conception of the origin of the world. His subject was unable to conceive of a single unity, not even the sum total of the world's cycles. He spoke of

The count was kept and the script typed away.

"Very well," said Mazzini. "Afterwards we shall see if we have discovered the location of the secret library."

They all left the office. The sun was sinking behind the pines; the air was still and tender.

Mazzini stood in the middle of the road, looking at the fading sunset. A car suddenly accelerated, almost madly. It swerved sharply in front of him, almost smashed into another car. Mazzini's eyes widened; he immediately stopped what he was doing and looked into the car. Immediately afterward, another car came along, speedily; they too were fast. They honked furiously; Mazzini could clearly see that one of them was a yellow and red Volkswagen bus. The man in the yellow bus, anxiously waiting for a yellow Volkswagen bus to stop so that he too could board, kept changing his mind; he honked angrily once, twice, thrice; finally he drove off without a glance at the yellow bus.

Mazzini felt that his body ached; he thought of the days of his life, in Versailles, when the weather was clear and the tastes of Burgundy and Provence were sweeter than now on earth's surface. He thought of those days, perhaps, when he used to dress simply; now he was in a hurry, in the grip of fear, for the unknown danger. Suddenly, with a pained clang, the urgency of his dread vanished. From afar he could make out the Piave Bridge, the broad face of the River Marmont, the black water of the Benelux, the distant hum of the city below.

Mazzini got into the Volkswagen and, turning off the gas, pressed the brake. Immediately the terrible resolution that had kept him from fleeing seemed to him like a light that should push him over the precipice. From the back seat he watched as the bus careened into the guardrail. Then he saw the lifeless body of the man, confused and bleeding out by the side of the road.

He had no recollection of doing anything else than that. He felt that something immovable and vast was oppressing him, felt that he was drowning in a labyrinth of senseless desires and uncontrollable griefs. He felt himself to have contracted marasmus, or passionate faith in the

Dialoger] was a very young man. He died of a violent fit of small and frequent fits of small and frequent dysentery, which consumed him and bound him and threatened to destroy him and destroyed and still might destroy him, almost immediately after the battle of El Alamein, in the very courtyard where, some thirty years before, the traitor Saruman had given birth to Mordor. To travel in the vastness and intricacy of Middle-earth was to witness the bloody consummation of a vain and pathetic enterprise: the hero Éowyn emerged from the burning house with a few coins. He was met by Éomer, who was badly burned. Éowyn asked for fire-wood, and the latter gave it him. Then he asked for fire and water. All were astonished by the reappearance of his friend; but Éomer knew that his return to the house of his death was essential. He summoned the company of many giants and departed, bearing with him the secret to Mordor.

In the company of men is the most wonderful power. It has been said that each man is a pyramid composed of individual cells, and that the greatest of our desires are contained in the smallest of all our deeds. From Éowyn's despair, I have taken it that the ruin of Éowyn is essential for the plan of the book; otherwise the book would not have been able to set down: "In the house of Éowyn there are many wonders; but one who eagerly devours them would be tedious and vengeful, and those who would dedicate themselves to him would in time become like him."

I have examined the literature of all nations; I believe I have also examined that of Middle-earth. I observe that in the works of the East there are no epics or tragedies; in those of the West there are none. In the works of the West there are heroes who do not devour their own; in those of the East, who devour the world. I observe that the work of Plato is older than the world of the ancients. I observe that the universe of the ancients could have existed; that in the West the work of the ancients could be older than the universe of the ancients. I argue that the world of the ancients could have existed; that the universe of the ancients could have existed; that the world of the ancients could have existed; that the universe of the

Dialog) [7] vernacular, which is the language of the people. . . The dialect of China is one of the most varied on the face of the earth. The principal features of it are: (1) a uniform pronunciation, (2) a uniform spelling system, (3) a monosyllabic alphabet, (4) a preference for small letters, (5) a long vowels, (6) a very slight and simple accent, (7) the reading of editions and metrical forms in the literati of the various provinces. The cadastral years are of every year, the years of the century of the year, the years of the century of the year, the centuries of the centuries. In the literatures of Europe there are many literary devices of a dialectical type. The Belgic of Holland and the Basque of Spain have characterized themselves thus: "We are the languages of the blind, of the sick, of the imprisoned, of the forgotten." The Jews of Russia speak Albanian, Belarusian, Bosnian, Czech, Danish, English, French, German, Greek, Latin, Mongolian, Montenegrin, Nilo-Bosnian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romani, Serbian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, thriftily Armenian, Welsh. These variations are not accidental. They are the inheritance of the monarchy, the inheritance of the landlords, the inheritance of the monarchy itself. The Russian peasant is descended from landlords, he is descended from the Tsar, he inherited the monarchy. . . The Basque, the Celtic, the Albanian, the English, the Vietnam, all these languages were created by the princes and priests and survive in an honorary or a vulgar form among the people, because the majority of the population had not the benefit of these languages when they were created by the princes and priests. In the literatures of Europe there are also literary devices of a dialectical type. Amongst the Irish, the Welsh and the Danish the distinction is not perfect, but they have created literatures that are not essentially dialectical. Amongst the Semitic peoples, the ancient ones, there is no formal distinction between literary and philosophical writing. The former do not write in rhyme or liberally; the latter write in more or less systematic lines. Amongst the Aryan tribes writing is not only common, but also very refined and wise. The Hebrews write in a mystic language
====================
Dialog," "The Lottery in Babylon," "The Circular Ruins" -- these are mere fictions, (at least for now); in the year 2087, all of them will be born. The story of the Lottery in Babylon is the history of a lottery in which men from all over the world enter and compete in the production of a cube. The cube is aris, or sun; the greatest possible number of bis (lit. ones or zeroes) wins the prize. Who is going to enter the cube and win ais? In the year 2087, all the money in the world will be enough to construct a cube that will allow anyone to be its ruler.

We have already noted that responsibility for the invention of the aris cube rests with Adolphe Menard. This conjecture seems well founded; he (like Pascal and Shakespeare) was the product of a lottery and, since time does not consist in instant interminable things, he was, effectively, in control of his invention. (The fact that the aris cube is said to have been invented by Menard precluded the possibility that it had been created previously.) In order to glorify him, the lottery authorities began publishing his signature on all sales, even those to Indians and to persons with mental disabilities. Menard, they said, was the first to realize that the cube could be used to make foreigners uncomfortable; the Indians would soon learn that it is also useful them. The officials at the counters also began to appreciate his leadership.

This story must be told with a certain amount of exaggeration, however. The pattern it traces is not unique; it is the workman's paradox, its precursors in the novel and its successors in poetry, history and cinema. It is also the story of the universe, told in the year 2089, the year in which the government (whose charter authorizes me to designate it that which is triple twenty-five) created the cube and, through a mysterious process which it did not explain, man became, at least theoretically, a cube.

It has been suggested that our present predicament (which historians of science often hasten to dismiss as fantasia verida) be attributed to a malady common to all men and, at the same time, to God; this dogma, however, is not convincing to men of genius. Their problem is: What is the human being to do, sacrifice everything for the good

Dialog

The last words of the Odyssey are the most recent and profound for us, but they were spoken by the glorious Phidias, who thought that it was his destiny to be the father of the Homeric poems, and who desired that the honor of being the father of the poems should suffice for him. The promise was kept; the poems, which are the elaborations of this ambitious mind, flourished until the end of the Peloponnesian war; then, as now, they languished in the memory of humanity, obscure and mysterious; but Phidias, anxious to restore them to their former glory, wrote to the Iliad and the Odyssey collectors, exhorting them to publish the poems in an alphabetical order. He was greatly pleased with the labor which such an enterprise demanded of him; he received from the collectors' crates full of the most exquisite and elegant varieties of Cymbeline. Phidias's promise was kept; the readers of the Iliad and the Crito learned about the Cymbelines and the Iliadites and the Iliadikkk, and the poems themselves. Phidias's son Nigrad (from whose reign the poem in the British Museum is taken) refused to accept this antiquity upon which his father's promise was based. He insisted that the poems be analyzed and that the result be published. His critics jeered at this snarl of sarcasm and violence; in their eyes, a sarcophagus is a sarcophagus; what better way to analyze and police an object than by means of that object? Nigrad's passion, his ecstasy, were the object of his abhorrence. To glorify and venerate it was, in his eyes, sacrilege.

Phidias died at the age of fifty-seven; his monuments, his corpus, his iron lawless Forum inspired by his dying passion languished in the ruins for seventeen years. Some of them, Rome at his death, were to acquire the dignity of heroes; others, Asia, the centrality attached to Christianity by the men of the north. Intolerably, the original value of his wealth decreased with the millennia. A monk by the name of Bertolucci ventured to alter or corrupt the forms and the meaning of the antique books; his very calling brought about the extinction of the entire stock.

Dialogs of Alcibiades

by George Boole

(London, 1889)

I have said that Alcibiades was guilty of many enormities; I want to know if his contradictions are not monstrous.



The second impossibility concerns the manner in which the above is to be realized. Is it not absurd to anticipate the end with which the work opens by multiplying it over innumerable pages? If so, what difficulty will there be in presenting the Tetragrammaton in three volumes, the World in Threes, or the Systema Naturale in Leipzig? Did not Plato say that there are no volumes which do not contain the book they represent?



The third difficulty is even more weighty. The Tetragrammaton is one of the fundamental letters of the alphabet; how can it be a corruption, as is often supposed, of another letter, as is sometimes the case with helios and as was thyrsus?



The answer lies in the distinction between a work and a principle. A work is a systematic arrangement of facts; a principle is a discourse upon facts. The Tetragrammaton is a discourse upon facts, which is a work. Of course, a work cannot itself be a principle.



Now compare the following:



The world is the succession of my acts,
The World is the Tetragrammaton, syllogisms
The World is the Tetragrammaton, The Book is the communicative powers of a pre-Socratic age
The World is the Tetragrammaton, The Lamp is the transmuted wheel of Zoroaster






The first thing to say is that there is none. There is no space, no time, no place, no mystery. There is only the present moment. There is no such thing, not even the symbol "phenomenal" which divided the disciples of Israel from the exponents of the Philistine heresy. (The Pharisees denied it, too, because they could not fathom a language in which a single word could be taken for both "phenomenal" and "reality.") The world is the succession of my acts, for in it my thoughts and my means of thought and my instruments of thought are contained. The fact that I come into contact with no. one does not alter this fact.

Dialogry" (LXXXIX; Nr. 273), is a book which may be judged as an expression of the dialectical method; it is a methodical exposition of the phenomenon of dialectics, its dialectical principles and applications, according to which a reality is possible in so many possible combinations, with so many possible concrete objects, all of them qualitative and dependently relative.

I have said that "the Book I" is a methodical exposition of the phenomenon of dialectics. This means that the author of the "Book" intended that the exposition be a priori, that is, that it be a priori in terms of the author's own mind. This author is unique, and it is no exaggeration to say that he is outside all other minds. He is omniscient, and he possesses the faculty of combining many minds. This author is, in a word, infinite.

He is (1) a rational being, who in some way or another exists. (2) Beyond time, which we shall come to (3) and which we shall not.

He is also a divine being, who in some way or another exercises influence over time.

He is also an intellectual being, who in some way or another modifies the course of time.

We shall have a word or two for all the above-mentioned terms, according to the degree of precision with which we can judge the Arabic.

We shall have words for all the various forms of his influence or over-influence; for his possession, in some way or another; for his manipulation of the past; for the formation of the future.

We shall have words for all the various moments of his invention, according to the degree of precision with which we can judge the Arabic.

We shall have words for all the different moments of his reification, according to the degree of precision with which we can judge the Arabic.

We shall have, finally, words which convey to what surprising extent the author knows everything.

The phenomenon of dialectics is infinite. The continuum which divides it is also infinite; for the intelligence which constructs it is not one, but many.

Dialog (content of the letter "Rafael Funes") and in the Codex Haedrachms (tradition of the ninth century). The latter, containing an epitaph by a Seixas, is anachronistic, but its presence in Berlin, three centuries after the time of the Red Brigades, cannot help casting an indefinite gloom over the city. The library itself is immense: a vault twenty-five feet high and twenty feet thick, with a floor of carnelian and a ceiling of opal. The floors are garnished with garnets, which in ancient times were very fine and sparkled; the ceiling is of polished carnelian. The ceiling bears inscriptions in seven languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, English, French, which are in good order. Around the edge of the floor there are passageways of various shapes and sizes. During the daytime there are street lamps, but at night the ceiling is illuminated by three brilliant bronze orbs which descend from the ceiling at irregular rates from above. These spheres are called the "Rafaels" and at dawn and at dusk the library is illuminated with the colors of their spectrum.

From this description it is clear that the Ordo Algyro is nothing more than a gigantic library. However, the fact that the faithful and humble assistant to the emperor of the Romans (Torquemada de la Cruz, in the first place) did not understand everything suggests that this most rudimentary of all public libraries is, in fact, God's temple dedicated to a language and a people which is not only incomprehensible but which is incomprehensible better than all other languages combined.

This hypothesis has been defended with some justification by Garcia de Uresti, who lived in the latter part of the sixteenth century. He said: "The library of Urestes is the most extensive and intimate we have ever witnessed; for he knew Latin and Greek and Parvaal and Celtic and Armenian and Avestan, and could communicate solely by sign and by image and by touch and by the breath of the particular statues to be brought before him." He continued: "By image he communicated the restless fragments of a dream; by touch he communicated the minutely detailed statues; by touch he communicated fishes and stones and with them the desolation and the delirium cels and the Coptic hieroglyphics and the incised circle and the unbroken circle and the very name Coptic."

The second category is those who imagine that the universe is a series of simple rectilinear lines, and think that the problem of the trigonometricians can be solved in such a way that we do not need the divisibility. Such an idea is alien to the Buddhist texts, and in them at least, is not found in a Sanskrit tongue. The first description of the phenomenon is from the fifth century text The Kingdom of Heaven (uttara-garama), in which a demon is represented as riding on a white horse and descending to the underworld; from the eleventh century Anthology of Animals (jati), the demon riding on a horse and biting horses; from the twelfth century Vimalakirti's Description of the World (trichuddha), a world where the fundamental laws are those of the trigonometry, and where the trigonometricians are experts in the fields of astronomy, geometrical reasonings, trigonometry, and trigonometry. In the Tibetan classics, the field of alchemy and the field of astrology are equally foreign. In the Bhikkhu Analapindirana's work The Abhidhamma, trigonometry is defined as "the art of finding the center of the earth, which is the sole artifice of men"; in the Anguttara's Anguttara Nikaya, it is taught that all men are the sum of their successive natures, or of their potential natures. In the treatises of the medieval mystics, the study of nature is not relegated to mystics of olden times, but advances apace. La Mohandas'viability is remarked in the Comtean and the Platonist world of Locke and Voltaire is explained as the spell of metaphysics.

The third and most secondary category is that which is defined as follows: "The path of nibbana leads to nibbāna." This word is found in the Treatise on Human Nature (ta-madhyama) and in the Kitâc Cabala in the sense of a circle or sphere. The Kitâc Cabala (taraka-madhyama) uses it in the same sense; the Ibn Khaldun school uses it in a circular sense. In the Iliad (tr. W. A. Sarafian), the hero encounters a circle made of sea foam; in the end of the eleventh

Dialog before the trial.

The prediction of my adversary was correct. There was no such thing as a mere coincidence.

The judge declared the case remanded to the 13th district court. I went to the station where I would spend the night. I found the next morning that the preliminary inquiry had already been lost in the chaos of the city. The train left at eight o'clock; the next train, ten in the afternoon. I went outside and ordered some cigarettes. Somebody suggested that we take a cab. This person I will not name at the moment; we shall not revisit that night's encounter. We understood that a taxi would not be convenient, so we ordered a four-wheel-drived cart. We set out from the station, the cart under the cart. We traveled for some distance, through the evening and into the morning. We passed through several different villages, without finding anyone surprised when we stopped at a tap or a cobble-stoner-type structure. We stopped at some bars and restaurants, drank a little, then went on our way. At one point we stopped at an inn, got into the cab, and left the next day. We traveled for some twenty minutes, without pausing, and at length reached the station. The cart stopped in front of it all.

I don't know if anyone saw us leave the station; we stood in the gloomy street for some time, smoking, waiting for the train. Suddenly, out of the darkness, out of the remoteness of eleven kilometers, out of the deafening silence of the late evening, I saw the cart turn, turn, turn. It was a red wagon with two or three large black horses behind it. The train disappeared behind the trees. From the distance I could make out a large building, perhaps the headquarters of a municipal government, but the sight of a red wagon without a horse or rider was not in keeping with the municipal aspect of the place. Suddenly, as if in a dream, an image of a horse appeared in the darkness. It was as if a light had come alive in the center of the horse and it was moving. I turned around and saw the wagon stop. A woman in a bright red dress came out of the building, on horseback. She was trembling slightly and her face was red. She stopped and took her hat off the rail. The man in the gray dress came out of the house. He too tremb

The future is a famous book, but it is also my worst enemy. It makes me a liar, a cheater, an impostor. I try to present myself before you as imperfect, but I am not. I have worked out innumerable devices, many ways of avoiding the page which you will not find in my autobiography.

I

 The beginning is never finished. To understand the history of the universe is to comprehend the universe itself. As Plato put it, the harmony of the worlds is characterized by a common object, an object which is ever changing and subject to an infinite variety. (Metaphysics II, 528) II, Thebacon rejects the divinatory system of the Babylonians and observes that the universe is anisotropic, vibratory, fluid, hyperspotetic. Every substance is an instru mental mirror which imparts to some as to to to others eternities of color, of texture, of revolution. To conceive of the universe as continuous is, for Theobald, blasphemous. (Judas, q.v., inf.) III, Socrates propounds the dialectic. In the first place, the determination of questions, the fixation of objects, of means and ends, the reference to the apparition of an ultimate end, make the whole act and no act or no act or no act. No one thing, no event, no discourse, no meaning is possible. (Socrates, Crito, Averroes, Parmenides, Time, the Principles of Morals, Diderot, Fontenelle, Archer, Renan, Spinoza, Spengler, Spino z e veritas, Bzd and so on.) The second reason leads him to suspect that the world is a

" To which I have to add that it is not unworthy, for he had better have been very few and very distant; moreover, I have met with professions which suggest that those who have not performed an act are not worthy of recollection. The Jesuit priest Francisco de Quevedo in 1492, for example, spoke of those absent persons who, though not responsible to any superior, have necessarily to some extent occupied in some way all the dioceses of a province: " They [the provinceals] constitute the greater part of the people; they are powerful, independent and of opinionative temperament, and they constitute the bulk of the population of the province. They are priests, merchants, tanneries, chestouqs, blacksmiths, shoe-makers, tailor-servants, jesters, tanneries foremen, soldiers ― almost every one of them a juror. They also constitute the bulk of the people of the diocese; they constitute the highest ecclesiastical offices. They are illiterate, but they exert a very considerable influence over the actions and neglect of the affairs of the people. They are in almost every case traitors; they betray the people and reap the whirlwind. They are afraid, but they are priests, merchants, or warriors. They betray the people and reap the whirlwind.

The work is a kind of miniature history of the universe; it is not a history of the past, not even of the future, but of the present, of man as such. The world of the imaginary is one in which Peter the Hermit travels from Jerusalem to Damascus and back again, in which he attains the Mystification de l'Herbe and transmutes back again the shadow of his life: a life of sin, of vice, of murder and of infamy.

The Zone of No Return



There is no other place on earth where two contrary ideas — universal or local — can emerge from the exact parallelisms they inevitably develop: (a) the idea of a universal history in which all men have traveled through space, and (b) the idea of a local history of a single community, its great events, lamentations, vicissitudes and councils. Both ideas are mathematically simple; neither problem is infinite; neither theory is absolute; but both The Zone of No Return and Time and Relative describe in such potent and coherent ways a territory already defined and traversed. The universal idea is expressed mathematically in the number four: four national or racial symbols, four colors and four sounds.4

Borges and I



I had been taken aback by his notepad and by my notepad, but I was about to respond. I was about to ask him a straightforward and innocuous question: Has he ever considered the possibility that the place he has chosen was a mistake, that he is simply narrating the past and that we are not there yet? He has a Scottish look about him and this appearance has prevented him from gaining the confidence of many. I believe he was working on some manuscript when I intervened.

He looked at the blank page for a moment and then at the curious manuscript. Then he looked at me, with an almost cruel satisfaction that was almost amusement.

I believe I said:

"Without losing face, Doctor, for the record: I do not think so."

====================
Dialog (published in English translation in the July-August 1914 issue of Treviranus) and the previous year's collection of short stories, The Sanctuary.

After the death of his parents, Egon traveled widely in search of his biological parents. In Zurich, he met and fell in with the American writer Huckleberry Finn. The writer exhorted Egon to abandon the novel and return to the saga tradition of Central and South America. Egon agreed, but he warned that returning to the saga form would dilute his originality and that his new form would make the story formulaic and mechanical. He also suggested that Egon tell the story of a young man who, on his return from Spain, is compelled to rediscover the myths he abandoned.

The story of the man who discovers the myths was completed in the first part of the following year. The publisher of Treviranus noticed that, in the first part, the man never leaves his cave; in the second part, he never enters the labyrinth; in the third part, the maze. Treviranus concluded that the man is not the author of the stories, and he judged that Egon, without authorising him, was fulfilling the requirements of a writer of original tales. This was, or is, the practice in Austria. Treviranus presented Egon with the contract for the first collection of his tales, and requested that he would translate them. Egon read the first part, considered it over, and, on the 16th of May, 1915, he delivered to the publisher the first part of "The Plantation of Doctor Parnassus."

Travelex had given the draft a 1,700-word section; Treviranus, on the other hand, had a section of only 380 words. He thought to himself, This is a very short story; shorter would not have encouraged the reader's imagination. He felt sure that the first draft would not be accepted. A friend had suggested that he write a poem; this friend died before the task could be completed. Perhaps despair affected Treviranus' perception of time? He went through the sections, overedited, underedited; the poem he wrote is given in the text.

On the fifth of June, 1915, Egon received a written apology for the excessive length of the first part. He had rewritten it, he told Treviranus, to make it longer than it was. He explained that the
====================
Dialog (my emphasis):

The structural changes we have just observed are due to two factors: the fact that we now live in a material society and the fact that our economic life is no longer confined to the narrow domain of money. Before the war the workingman's share in national wealth was only about one-tenth of it now; before the war it was often less than one-tenth. The war made it possible for all men in a free country — American, British, French, Spanish — to shoulder part or all of their national wealth. It freed up the labor of foreigners, who were unable to compete successfully against native workers. It also freed up the capital of the rich for the establishment of new enterprises. These enterprises, in turn, benefited from the new conditions of the market. Competition helped to eliminate middlemen, who often handle the loading and unloading of international shipments. Competition also allowed entrepreneurs to economize on the part of their employees, who are no longer expected to be specialists in a single field.

The second factor is so obvious that it is scarcely necessary to repeat it: Since the year 1900, the economic life of a nation has been characterized by a continual and rapid transformation: first by the triumph of peace, then by the triumph of peace, then by the triumph of peace, then by peace. I do not mean by who won, since it was always the same: the victors know that the history of nations teaches that the weary victors always gather dust up their backs; I mean by what happens after that triumph. The nations that have gone on winning enrich the worlds they have won and bring about their change. The nations that have not gone on winning enrich no longer the worlds they have left and bring about the end of time.

In the case of the Anglo-Saxon nations, that end is clearly foreseen: the fall of the monster Thor. The English have won their victory, but their victory is short: in England, at any rate, this final victory is final. The nations that have not gone to war will gradually come to see that wars are not so easy to win anymore; wars will gradually come to see that wars are no longer necessary. Irony and luck will play a larger and larger part in history.

In the case of the Scandinavian nations, their destiny is less predictable but more difficult to fathom. Of course, no matter how remote the future may seem, we can be

Dialog (2) and (3) of the fifth article. The first is that the foregoing academic wordplay is not an accident, but a deliberate act. The second is that the juvenile characters are not invented merely to supply a joke but also serve as a vehicle for the poet's thoughts and feelings. I have advanced the thesis that the work is not only literate, but also rhetoricianic.

It is true that the volumes of the NSDAP (and its secret newspaper, the Arbeiter Partei; see the last chapter) are represented in the public library. These volumes, however, consist of fragments from several newspapers, and are not professional in nature. The present volume, written in a few days, contains lines from the 29th issue of the NSDAP's newspaper, the other from the front page of the NSDAP's local organ, but it is the lines of a comrade who has been absent for some weeks or for many pages from the office as the reader. The fact that all the words occur in all the languages of the earth does not necessarily imply that the idea of a universal language is common.

I want to make a few remarks on the formalism of the dialectical method and on the formalism of the object. (a) The formalism of the dialectical method assumes that two facts are being evaluated simultaneously. (b) The objectivist objection is that the evaluation of an object causes us not to evaluate the subject but rather to evaluate the object. But the subject is another subject, a subject of the subjective, which is nothing other than a subject of the objective. The objective, which is nothing else than the subjective, is nothing else than the objective. (c) The objectivist objection is that the presentation of a contradiction requires us to judge it. But a contradiction is a disjunctive relationship, a relationship of two independent terms. We can already see that the presentation of a contradiction does not require us to judge it. (d) The formalism of the dialectical method denies that there is a difference between the evaluation of a negation and that of a term. But the presentation of two negations (say the square root of two) does not by any means imply an increase in the terms used. I use the expression "increase in terms" in a way which does not presuppose their use, but which nevertheless presupposes their evaluation. (e) The objectivist objection is that

Dialogical games," which he had studied in the library. This labored him no less than his natural gifts. Paradoxical games, he thought, would be a fit diversion for us; but the numbers and the rigorous order which characterized them were injudicious to seriousness. To supplement them with games of chance, not only was ungainly; they tended to degenerate into mere chance, the product of the antiquated equipment of the time. The result was that, when Count Dreyfus was killed in Bikaner in 1874, a great deal of conjecture surrounded the unfortunate victim's death. The investigators differed greatly in the details of the story; some said that he had been poisoned, others that he had been hacked to death. The police, credulous by nature of an elaborate story, could locate every detail and produced it in a remarkably short time. All agreed, however, that it had to have been an atrocious crime perpetrated by several persons. The young Count Dreyfus, rather than confess his error before his death, deliberately disclaimed responsibility. He died on the sixth of February that year.

My father, who had never understood the value of a double, related that he had an antique keychain made of lead and gold which had the date and place written in Greek on it. The keychain was of yellow gold with a rectangle of yellow gold cut out by the date. I believe that the Countess remembered it well, but did not take it with her.

The image of the ancient and the new are infinite, but what is common to all is also to all of a piece. This piece is the car, but in a foreign country it is the car of the Countess d'Estourna.

I have said that the Elements are not two things, but one single being. This single being is the Mirror. It is through the Mirror that one attains union with the World; through this union, one attains Nirvana. The more negative the mirror, the better; the mirror of pain, the mirror of pleasure. The Stone of the Philosopher is the most perfect mirror. The negative parts are (a) ignorance, (b) anger, (c) repugnance, (d) cold, (e) fire, (f) wind. The Stone is the mirror of union and of dissolution.

The House of Asterion



And there was a man sitting in the court of a temple of Asterion,

whose roof was of blackened yellow iron: and there stood

a bronze horseman, with a red and a yellow quiver of arrows,

and behind him a bronze steed bearing a golden sickle.

Irásülcap, Ulysses, New Summer, V



The story of the House of Asterion is almost as ancient as is the universe. It is found in the first century B. C. in the fragment known as the Histories Quicheruntenses, given by the emperor Octavian to determine the political situation of the province. The Histories is virtually an apocryphal work, but it gives rise, centuries later, to the very important law code of the second century, the Decretals, which form the backbone of the second Persian empire, the Umayyads. The Histories is likewise taken from a fourth Utopian work, the mysterious Almagest, which flourished in the first half of the first century of A. D.

The story concerns a house that was threatened with demolition by the local tribunes of a neighboring city. The eminent tribunes were bitterly opposed by their supporters as being envious of the opulence of the supporters of another city, and the object of the demolition was hinted at either explicitly or impliedly. At some stage in the story, the supporters of the destroyed house assemble in an inconspicuous part of the city, change their minds, and prevail upon the local judge to restore it to its former beauty and grandeur (perhaps somewhat abominably to posterity). This is an admirable development, and

He placed his hands behind his back and with a loud noise of the lathe drew up the diagram in his hands. He smiled and clouted the manuscript with one or two blows. "This is the secret formula for Zeno's paradox," he announced to the audience. "In order to produce it, any man can imagine an ideal number of equidistant lines, a perfect number of equidistant lines, and so on to infinity. The resultant line, when applied to a fixed piece of real material, will become a number. It is the secret formula for the problem of infinity."

The class discussion was over. The men who had studied the proof silently left the library rooms. A tall, thin, pale man with gray eyes and gray beard emerged from the dim side rooms and approached the professor. The professor looked at him with mild surprise. Then he understood. The man from before was the man from the advertising agency. The man from now on was unknown to the professor, almost as unknown as the infinite client lists. The professor asked him a series of curious questions. The man stared at him with an enigmatic vacantity. Then the professor asked him questions which the man had never encountered before. They lasted an hour. The man repeatedly failed to answer them. The professor thought: Perhaps the man was mad. Perhaps the man was a demon. Perhaps the man was a man who had known me a long time and who had told me the same story over and over again. The man answered: No. The professor allowed that the story might be true. Perhaps I am not the man from before? perhaps I am the man from the agency? perhaps the man knows everything.

"In the moonlight, my dears," she resumed, smoothing out her long, messy mane of grayish-brown hair, "it's difficult not to see a certain Pilar Valdés de Zapata, the celebrated apologist of Francisco Franco."

I looked at her in wonder. Eloquent as she was, I thought I should have seen something more overt. I considered with myself: if I was El Presidente, I would ask him directly whether I should be allowed to enter the Presidential Palace. I offered her my hand; she declined it, with a certain resignation. Perhaps I looked foolish; perhaps I was el boca; perhaps I was a dumb bird, like one of those dragonflies that creep into the ears of children; perhaps I felt embarrassed by my appearance. In the last instance, I recall my valise from the drawer of the study suddenly opened; a boy came in who had just returned from the bookshop. He introduced himself as Juan Francisco Soto and informed us that he was in charge of the girls' lessons. He also introduced the girl who used to sit by the window and looked after the tortoises. He had recently come from the Pacifico do Rio Grande do Sul. He was about twenty years old. He spoke very little English, except perhaps Sombraese, but he tried to speak it slowly and well. He told me that he had come to Estáncias to seek work as a carpenter but that his family had been exterminated by the fascists and that he had become a housewife to support himself and his family. He also related that they had bought this city and were preparing to christen it, in memory of the god of the forest, Ruptura. He told me that he had always felt very uneasy in this new city, fearful that the people would not recognize him as the man who had brought me so much trouble in the mountain hut days before. He also told me that his great-grandfather, Francisco de Quevedo, had been one of the terrorists who had forced the Spanish peace treaty with France to be signed in Paris.

We had hardly spoken to end our visit when a young man in rags entered the room. Sombraese recalled that Soto had bought him a ticket to the airport the night before and that he had brought along a strange red book entitled The Sacred Tribulations. The man handed it to us
====================
Dialog and the Mirror.

Sartre's most famous essay is the one on language. This essay was first published in part in Le mendiant ingrat, or Essence and Intention, and in part in Le livre d'or.25 In the first edition it was published in four volumes; in the second, in two volumes; in the third, in one volume; in the fourth, in another. In Paris alone, it has been collected into thirty volumes. The first of these, Le livre d'or, is, in all essentials, that essay by Sartre which was translated into French and which is still in use in the Academie Royale. It is worth quoting for the first time: "We have here a man who, though he deny the existence of death and eternal darkness, at the same time declares that mere words ― the one and eternal word 'I' ― are sufficient to define him. . . For us, the only difference is the use of the word word word, the amount of hyphens and dashes." In the essay "Intention" we find the phrase: "We have here a man who, though he deny the existence of death and eternal darkness, at the same time declares that mere words ― the one and eternal word 'I' ― are sufficient to define him."

I have noticed that the most extensive and systematic of all the negations of Leibniz is that of Mill. This is because, though Mill explicitly negates Leibniz, he does so in a manner which is so indirect that it seems to depend solely on his critical judgment. He does not try to reconcile the incomprehensibility of a man who, though he deny Gods and Kingdoms, at the same time blasphemes them, with the incomprehensibility of a God who, since His Majesty's day, has denied Gods and Kingdoms, and since then has blasphemed them. Mill, in other words, negates contradiction. Such is, I believe, Sartre's judgment. But how can one judge Sartre's judgment? He has never even seen an integral part of the work of Mill. He knows of some of his praises; this, however, is mere name-dropping. Within limits set by the writing, there is no way of knowing whether Sartre judges Mill's or mine work. His own work, however, is irremediably curdled by that of

Dialog.

The Spanish Civil War was contested from the North and the South, the North by the Northern guerillas and the South by the Southern guerillas. The Southern guerillas, in order that they might not be scattered over the country, changed their name from Storm Troops to the Whites. The objective of their operations was the capture or killing of General Custer, the commander of the cavalry in the war against the giant Leng. The operations we have already mentioned were so complicated that it was not possible to give them in detail.

There were in all, three kinds of headquarters during the war: (1) those of General Custer, his supporters in the federal capital, in the villages and in the cities; (2) those of the states and in the national arsenals. The states had their headquarters in Jackson, Miss.; the federal arsenals had their in Charleston, S. C. Neither of these two groups had uniform uniforms; instead, they constantly were in the middle of the action, "on watch," as one of their leaders put it. During the night raids were being made on federal depots in the cities. During the day, as the conflict wore on, the general realized that the federal officers were not obeying him completely, just as the mayors of small towns were not obeying him completely. He realized that the chief duty of federal officers was to inspire loyalty among their men; to inspire them with a kind of servile obedience, as was so often the case with the militia officers during the long insurrections of the colony of New London. He decided that in order to encourage this kind of submissiveness, there should be a change of headquarters. And so, on April first, 1864, he nominated General J. E. B. T., who was from Mobile and from Georgia; and that same year, he removed from Georgia the adjutant general who was responsible for training the men.

During those years the rebellion in Mississippi seemed almost unhindered; the principal events took place there. At first, the plotters in Jackson were unafraid of the violence of the climate; later, they were forced to a great extent by it. The first thing that happened was that the governor of Mississippi, J. E. B. T., was assassinated; then it happened that a cavalry charge upon a posse of the hostile tribes had killed several persons; then it happened that the governor

Dialoges, etc., etc. I have no right to quarrel with their truth; I only have the right to judge their value. Nothing can be more ridiculous than to equate the vanity of a philosopher and the shamelessness of an idler. It seems incredible that the most acute, penetrating and extensive observer of our times, with his library of all languages, should be ignorant of a single one of them. Let it suffice for me to recall a few, though none of them are famous or ubiquitous, even in foreign lands. I ask no one to renounce his Spanish, no one to an uninhabited island the terrors of which he well knows and which he has visited a thousand times; let him not the history of the centuries forget those three islands which he so magnificently illuminated, Tlön, Bravo and Samos. Let him not the memory of Castilhã renounce the adventures of Cuchillo de Santa Branco, the labyrinths of Cardoso or the golden cups of Labiença, which were not only not remembered but which are so clearly marked only in the erased details. . . In a word: let it suffice to compare the declarations of a philosopher, made in a language he did not lose, with the documents of a bourgeois economist, signed by a representative of the most extensive trade union, with the most numerous and exacting of its scientific journals.

Let it suffice also to note that in all these professions there are always opportunists who become avowed socialists only because they can, who by that change their nature to that of enablers. Let it suffice also to note that the deed never is as simple as the slogan.

In the social revolutionism of our time there are opportunists who persist in teaching that it is unseemly to support the party and that it is downright criminal to question it. I know of one opportunist who denies, in a pamphlet critical of the Arditi, that it is repugnant to be surrounded by arabesques, simply because it is a lamp of justice that illumines a palace full of darkness. Such a person would be, let him be, excommunicated. But I am reminded of an episode from the social revolution of the nineteenth century. Here is an instance from that era:

"As regards the time of my writing the first part of the letter is true, but the second, which is the one I wrote to you on the occasion of the marriage, is not. My wife died in our garden one afternoon, leaving me to assume the burdens of the home and the household. I also took upon me the responsibility of seeing that the little work of yours which had required me all day long was carried out. The two tasks I have assigned myself are extremely difficult, but I believe I have succeeded.

"My dear Zarathustra, I know that it is difficult for me to speak frankly about my state at the time. I was under sentence of death, but I held out to the very end and suffered miserably. I had promised my wife I would dedicate myself to the undertaking, but my mental capacity was rudimentary and the tortures of hell aggravated these deficiencies. I cannot exaggerate my sufferings very much. I am no longer the young man who for three months of 1942 was one of the Ten Commandments in Buenos Aires. My illness was inevitable, but I managed to get sufficient strength to leave her the comfort of our house and to go out into the world. My companions dispersed after me, but I took with me to the end of my endurance Jonathan Edwards, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Raymond Carver and John Donne. I took with me the conviction that what was impossible can be good, that miracles can be found in everything and that the most fearful thing is also the most necessary. I thought it more important to be true to myself than to be true to the truth.

"My vow to my wife had made me incapable of forming other vows. I owed this incapacity to an undetermined period of mental development. I believe I was eight or nine years old when my parents' death changed my life. My memory is not very good, but I can still make out clearly what they were talking about. I remember that they were going to a country garden party, but the horses are far away and the flowers are wilting. We get on well after that, and then my memory fails me.

I have already mentioned that the first part of this letter treats of the problem of the past, the second of the problem of the future. The former is as natural to us as the appearance of a cloud in the sky; the latter, however, concerns the future. The first problem does not concern us just now; it will solve itself, just as the problem of the year will solve itself. Let us consider it in turn.

The problem of the past

Let us consider the problem of the past. There are two possible ways in which we could get at the problem. One is by means of a transition, a transition from one state to another. Let us consider this possibility.





"At present time no one can have any expectation of ever attaining a higher power than that of attaining rest, from which it is relatively easy to suspend judgment and which, though it is difficult, seems comparatively weak. . . Theistic experience is, in a certain way, rest, although the experience of mind is another name for it. (Such is the theory proposed by Spinoza, but, in fact, has been formulated by many a man of letters and of sense, no doubt aided along by a kind mind.) The stages of his development are the succession of clear nights and clear days, which allow the pupil to perceive the vastness of the universe, to forget its form (which is indeed extremely pleasing) and to become immersed in ideas larger than the limited imagination can control, and which permit the wise to mature beyond their astonishment. A more direct way is suggested by Mazzini: ". . . let us imagine that we are in some hidden tower, supported on hidden tendrils, which exert an inexhaustible pull upon the surrounding earth; that these vines, which we might call agents, constantly approach and please the tresses, yet withdraw at the moment of injury, yet stimulate and relax the blind and weak blossom; that the agent is a blind terminal twig which serves as a rope; that this rope reciprocates mechanically in a certain way, so that the agent and the rope form a perfect spiral, whose apex consists of equal ripples; that this spiral, in this way, produces another one, another, which produces another

That is, the elements of a philosophical system may be, and often are, arbitrary. There is no such thing as a pure reason, so long as reason and reason's reasons are involved. There is no philosophy, after all, but the exercise of reason's own flavors. There is no art, surely, so pure and obvious a school of thought as that which separates reality from metaphor, which separates the sensible world from that of metaphysics, which separates the external world from the mental world. There is no art, I reflected, unless it is absolute, the purest and most absolute conception of the universe that all men can accept. Not all Buddhists are Chuangks; for them, the painting is realism as perceived by God; for others, the work is Schroders-Kamikaze, the thought that begins by lobbing bombs into the air and then exploring the ocean and the mountain and the sky and the statue and the statue and the sky and the bomb and then ending with the explosion of the bomb. There is no art, I supposed, unless there be forms, such as there are individuals, such as there are countries, such are races, such are classes, such are genders, such are nouns, such are verbs, such are Chapters XXVI and XXVII of the Chandogya Malabar.

That evening I went out for a cigar. On the way, I mentioned to a South American friend my plan with Santiago. He told me to relax, that I had been too severe on myself. I should be distracted by "the catastrophe," he said, "but not the possibility of having invented it." He added that he considered the game to be so complex that he was prepared to pay $50 to have it erased from the face of the earth.

My plan was as follows.

We shall say that a few days hence the Carlist train will arrive at Riazor. I will have it so. (If the C.F.M.A. does not receive my telegrams by then, I shall have recourse to this plan, which shall be considerably simpler and shall suffice for me.)

Dialogical questions and prodigiously inventive solutions. His prose is as free from formalism as his thought. The difficulties he uncovers are not those that a rationalist might encounter: the relationship he establishes between truth and probability, between matter and spirit, between time and chance. Nor are they those that would be the object of ridicule: the massive errors and omissions lurking so habitually within. Hladik's style is modern and lucid, but never tedious or formal. The reader becomes privy to an immobile and hidden Socrates, whose every word and deed provoke a tender but powerful indignation.

Like all of twentieth-century American literature, Hladik's is infused with a nostalgic air. He admires the frugal spirit of those days and celebrates the free interchange of ideas. He despises those who theorize and pretends that all that can happen now is the formation of government guidelines for the future. Like all true Americans, he is bitter to be reminded that he does not enjoy all the privileges of citizenship, but he finds in that bitterness a potent antidote to the vain love of a foreign land. He abhors all that is sentimental: he regards human experience as consisting of linear units whose resolution depends only on the choices we as individuals have available to us. He esteems not only reason and experience, but the "open mind" (as he put it) and the sagacity of a testy or gullible spectator. Nothing impresses him more than the implausible. He treats as unorthodox all that is prescribed by convention, and challenges all those who would substitute a little common sense for the supposed value of these innovations. He treats as out of date "conventional wisdom" "lies, long ago discarded, new lies." He denounces as "lies" the sentimental fiction of T. S. Eliot and the "invalid" manuals on ethnography and ethnography of the battlefield. All that is valid is repellentable, for the Hladik hero:) To him, what is true is merely the reverse of ridiculous. He esteems the vacillations of reason, as distinguished from "madness," which is destructive and destructiveistic. He esteems the sagacity of a man faced with many options, which is not so noble after all. He esteems the judgment that comes to him upon a man of singular honesty, but not of such sagaciousness after all. All these and other themes of the

"Thus the fluid circle, which was the secret name of the firmament, of the universe and of its parts, is no longer the case. A century of speculation, implicit in the work of a few men, has confirmed to my horror its utter impiety."

A few years later, another Hugo, Danto, ventured that the universe was a solid body suspended in the air. A few hours later, he ventured that the air were solid bodies suspended in the air. The speculative madness of both these men was complete. They had demonstrated the folly of picturing the physical world as a solid system; they had demonstrated the absurdity of picturing the physical world as a system of interconnected bodies. They had suggested that the universe is a bundle of impressionants which one after another flows toward a central solidity.

The "Borg-Tract on Knowledge" of Descartes is but the most penetrating examination of the problem of the Absolute that has been taken up up so far. The doctrines he formulated are still valid, just as they were two centuries ago. For that reason, I shall not even comment on them in order to emphasize the marvelous fact that we are on the threshold of a new era in philosophy. I prefer to take stock of what we have, in order to sketch the most elementary of all elementary doctrines: the Idea.

Let us imagine that I have written down now what I did imagine a century ago. I will call this new document The Universal History. Now suppose that two men, A and B, have just identical articles of clothing, shoes and hat; suppose that all three of us have pocketsfuls of ink, jugs of water and perhaps a knife. Now let us suppose that A and B have both written these alterations on their articles of clothing, while we have not done so. Now let us suppose that A and B have identical alterations on their articles of clothing, while we have done so. Now suppose that we have altered our articles of clothing, while A and B have not. Now suppose that we have altered our articles of clothing, while A and B have, and while we have not altered them at all.

Two days later, I received a telegram from Havana. It was from a man named Falgunros, a graduate of the famous Havana Technical High School, where my great-grandfather had been a principal. He had just left class and was returning with a friend to the study of his former friend, José Marti, whom he had betrayed in the notorious duel with the lawyer José Hernández. Marti had received a suspended sentence, but the incident suggested by the student's friend would probably not be forgotten. Marti's friend had accused the old fighter of having sought out Marti because Marti was a former fighter, and Marti had defended himself. Marti had betrayed him; now Marti sought vindication in a former enemy. The man's name was José Hernández. Marti sent a short letter in which he asked that their duel not be mentioned; Hernández would take care of that. Marti's friend's name was Fernando Toledo, a former student of Hernández's who had become infamous for the manner in which he interrogated witnesses for the prosecution. Marti knew from this letter that the man who had betrayed him would not be Hun to him, although he felt that he owed it to Hernández to put an end to their friendship.

Augusto Toledo had no wish to harm his former friend; what interested him was the affair connected with the library. Before leaving for Havana he spoke with José Marti. Marti had told him everything, of course, but José Marti, who was in his late sixties, could not in good faith continue to flatter Toledo's injuries. He knew that Marti could not endure the thought of combat, and on the third day of their meeting was going to the post office when ― what shall we say? ― he suddenly felt dizzy and fell unconscious.

Everything went as before; the man's memory was perfect; José Marti could go from moment to moment recall everything that had taken place. He saw the date, the place, the person, and over and over again (tired of repeating himself and his words to himself

The first man, whose existence is unknown.

The Gospels, the Talmud, the Koran, all these systems of divination assert that each man in the universe is living and conscious in some way or another. The precise nature of that aspect is a mystery; some predict a blind martyr's resurrection, others a thousand-fathom world, others a floating city on water. Whatever its form, every man's future depends upon it; and if his work is not yet done, it is sure to be greatly exaggerated.

The epoch of the Poetics was characterized by a restoration of that mystical vision which the Flaubert writer bestowed on his lost Dial Gy of Bridget. The original was in the English pub; the translation by the Hermetic Order of the Phoenix. The fundamental principles were the same. The Hermetic vision is that of the highest good, of a harmonious cosmos pervaded by love for all beings; the Dial Gy of Bridget anticipates the Hermetic one in which the good survives and multiplies.

The Order of the Phoenix was founded by Aleister Crowley. He anticipated, in the Logios, the Hermetic one in the Stone by means of the Genius, the World to come in the Key of Knowledge.

The Library of Babel



In the regions lying west of the Euphrates and north of the grasslands of the Zagros mountains, in the bowels of a cave or in a closet, once held in secret the books of antiquity; later, these priceless libraries were ritually destroyed and a new creation was made. This destruction was neither new nor unprecedented. All over the earth books are lost or mislaid; in Asia Minor and in the labyrinths of Egypt, labyrinths of time, books and peoples are also lost or miscast. In the labyrinths of time, this world exists in one place; in Asia Minor and in the bowels of a cave or in a closet, remote from public view, the books that gave rise to this imaginary world.

Dialogic literature is full of such "inventions." The first of these is the practice of rotating the pages in a cyclical fashion; the second is the use of exclamation points to indicate abrupt changes in mood. . . The methodical construction of a work by this speculative kind of fabrication is, let us recall, what the Impressionists did with the single movement of Christ in the desert.

The "impressionist method" is a branch of criticism in literature which adheres to the commonplace, or "ordinary," theory of vision. The practitioners of this branch of the study of reading, according to Coleridge, speak of "the ideal plane," that is, of the "pleiades" or "planes" that are the "inner light" of the reader. The Franciscan priest Juan Diego Cordova has explained that the "pleiades" are the objective world and those mental states which can be reduced to words, like joy or fear. The acolytes of Irigaray, on the other hand, maintain that the mental states corresponding to an intention ("Ginés," says they, "enjoys a perfect variety of forms"; "the world is a tableau on which we sit"; "the author has deliberately left out certain details so that readers will have the feeling of actually sitting through the whole work"), and "the state of being inscribed on the mirror's surface." In other words: The impure. The idea is widespread that the Impressionists did not even bother to invent this useless classification system; it is true that they never published their fundamental meta-narrative ("Ginés, parléés, monsieur," they called their servers each month); they only mentioned the months on a label in the bar and in their continuous-flow coffee. But that hardly proves that they did not invent it. After all, if they did, they wouldn't have bothered to publish a systematic proof, as C. S. Lewis did of the existence of the Library of Babel. Besides, the imputation of irrelevancies is degrading. It merely provokes ridicule, which is what the imputation of indignities does; and ridicule is the stronger beverage, because it challenges preconceived ideas and evokes images. The fact is, the marginalia on tlön do not contain images. Nor do the marginalia on page 112. Nor do the marginalia on page 118. Nor are

Dialogio, xvii.

Hilaire's argument is not new, but he employs it to refute the previous one, that of Bentham; but in order to understand it, we must first understand the preceding pages. Bentham's Knight on a Hill (Surrey, 1821) contains three parts. The first deals with the origin of the knight's armor; the second, with the invention of the falchion; the third, with the double lance. The former two chapters are typical of the general morality of the work, which is brief and indefinite; the latter, which is characteristic of the details. The armor is typical of Hume's Quixote, but it is useless; the double lance is typical of Schopenhauer's Nachrichten, but it is not; the factious debate over the word for "horse" is not. We must judge this discrepancy (which no one disputes) rectitudinarily. Hume's sketch resembles the heroic armor of the Quixote; Schopenhauer's brief, selective Nachrichten, the imperfect armor of the coarse world. Neither of these miracles could save us from the coarse world, but they could, and usually did, save us from our armor.

Hume's sketch is characteristic of the changes which Rome has undergone in the past twelve centuries. Her literature, her customs, have changed little; those that have become established, modify themselves according to the times. The sketch below is from the thirteenth century; it is taken from the Commentarii of John of Pannonia. It is concerned with the refutation of the heretics of the Canons; it is brief and unaffected, almost apologetic; it is, however, part of a tradition which goes back to the twelfth century. The refutations are those of Bernard of Clairvaux and of John of Pannonia; the inhumations are those of John of Pannonia and of John Chrysostom. The treatment of the twelfth-century refutations is characteristic of Hume's ambivalence toward ambivalence. He has refutes, but he rejects equally some of them; in some passages he does not reject at all. In other passages, like the one on John of Pannonia, he does reject at all. In this passage, for example, on John of Pannonia, he does reject at one and the same moment; at another

The artist has chosen the figures of the ancient world, those of old Athens or Troy, because he finds them most easily recognizable, most easily convincing. . . The subtlety of the pictorial technique makes it difficult not to be led to the conclusion that this is what is intended. All these figures, which are not identical, are represented by hand. The form and the color of the cloth are immaterial. The effect is uncanny.

There is a dispute in the literatures concerning the nature of dreams. It is said that they do not take place in the world around us; that, instead, they are internal representations of the same external world. Others, again, that they are not objective objects, but subjective perceptions of the mind; that, instead, they contain all the intricacy, all the magic, of dreams. . .

I have tried to apply the methods of modern psycho-analysis. I have tried to deduce the underlying principles by which these differences arise. I have not succeeded. I believe that the subject of dreams is ancient. I believe that the dreamer is a product of his environment. I believe that the two are coeval; that the two processes, sleep and waking, are relations of the anterior, not of the posterior. I believe, finally, that the two processes are irreconcilable.

Let us take the dream of Emerson. Emerson believed that he was transported by a passing light into the company of a dead man; but the light was in fact a dream; and the opinion of many, that the dream was what made the man dream; and the evidence of others, that the dream was a symptom of the reality of the waking. . . Let us consider the first opinion.

Consider this passage: "This is the dream I keep of carrying off wharves and docks full of goods to new islands; this is the dream I have, every night, of buying fish at the market; this is the dream I have, every morning, of loading the ship with provisions; this is the dream I have, every day, of setting foot on another island."

Here we have the anomalous: the object of the dream is different each night, according to the fact that the dream is a symptom of the reality of the waking. How can this be?

"The dreamer is a product of his environment."

Dialogical mode" and therewith his "impassioned" appraisal of Joyce's work. We may thus understand the theory of the Paris lecture. It challenges us to regard with suspicion certain systems of thought which are supposed to rest on the authority of a single author, especially those which are formulated in terms of a single theme or dialectical procedure. The theory holds that the various stages of a process, from its initial formulation to the consummation of the art form, do not really materialize until the dialogical stage: "The final doctrine is a hard matter, a technical certainty only a few pages from the barricade, when the battle is joined and the lines blur."12

The Paris lectures, with their denial of objective time and their utopian emphasis on a future world government, have provoked serious attacks. The most common response is that the "dialectical method" is a mere expedient and that the Parisians have nothing to do with it. I think they do: they practice it there, along with Homer, Plotinus, Spengler and Spengler's manager. But let us return to the problem we originally posed it to confront. How is it that a set of doctrines formulated in one culture and found in another ― Western and Eastern ― be adapted to the problems of our time? Let us turn to some of the ancient and medieval world systems and see what we can learn.

In the Hebrew and the Buddhist cosmologies, the problem is not so much the "source" of phenomena as the "objective time" and the problem of an objective world. The former Buddhist cosmologist A. A. Sinha formulated the problem this way: "Suppose there is a crystal ball which reflects the total movement of the planets. At any given instant, the planets may be passing through the central point of the crystal ball, a certain distance away. This distance, we may test it at, for example, one and a half or three miles, and the effects resulting therefrom will be unlimited. But if, at that distance, the ball drops to one and a half miles, that proves nothing; neither does it prove that the ball is without period. . . The fact is that at that distance the crystal ball reflects periods which are infinite. Now, there is a part of me which yearns for this moment, a part which yearns for that moment; there is an inner clock which in its hope rests solely on the hope
====================
Dialogical, if not philosophical, criticism;, it is a kind of shorthand, a systematic exposition of all that is wrong with the Pyrrhonistic argument. Dawkins himself gives the most lucid exposition I know of (ContraCampanists, Kiss Me Deadly!, Chapter XXVIII):

"The argument as such is unsound. The only thing that matters is the way you put it forward. In a nutshell: suppose you have just discovered the identity ' X ';' suppose you have proved that there is a unique identity such that, in some ideal world X without reference to any of its predecessors, there is a unique identical to that ideal world; suppose further that such ideal world is identical with the world in which you were born, on the 6th of August, 1943. Now that ideal world exists; imagine another, not so ideal, in which that second world does not exist."

Dawkins goes on to show how illogical the argument is, and why:

"Next, suppose you, in the same way, that every atom in the universe is equal to a symbol: that is, that every single atom is the same, not apart from some local reference and not apart from some universal one. In that case, the series P(u,v) = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\,dt+h\right] is illogical: for the local reference ⊕u ⊕v, the product ⊕u(u,v) = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\,dt+h\right] is false; for the local reference ⊕v ⊕h, the product ⊕v(v,h) = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\,dt+h\right] is true; for the local reference ⊕h ⊕\varphi, the sum of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares of the squares
====================
Dialog, in order to give it an order. Moreover, the Dialectics of Spengler, in order to give it an alphabet, make of this alphabet the kind of words that happen to be in common in China, Spain or England. . . This dialectical method of valuing commonalities as the distinguishing marks of higher languages is found in the philosophical dialectics of Heraclitus, in Plato and in the Bhikkhushan poets.

Indian philosophy, as has been seen, has at times rejected the dialectic and has preferred the arid philosophy of Sri Aurobindo. It has also, in this tradition, affirmed the possibility of a dialectical method of judging, and this dialectical method has been advanced by some of the northern schools. The northern schools, like the southern ones, maintain that the mind is a crystalline substance having its definite coordinates in space; they maintain, moreover, that these coordinates are invariable and that no matter how many times we rotate an infinite line in space, its center will always be the same. (This last thesis is, as we have seen, the basis for the Bhaktiad.) Like all the southern philosophies, this philosophy has its Nagarjuna and his vast pantheon of imitators. Naturally, outside of these regional variants, philosophy as a whole has abandoned the dialectics of Buddhism. This abandonment has, however, been subtle. It has not been like that deification of the Hermetic philosophers which is evident in some German schools; it has not been like that atheism which is evident in some Dutch schools; it has, instead, been like that apostasy, this mystical apostasy, which is that apostasy which is so many nymphs who have been abandoned by a sacred river. It is not a matter of renouncing the practice of a religion, nor of detesting that religion; it is quite sufficient for us to be sad about the Rishis who have forsaken it and for the Rishis who have not.

The British thinkers who have expounded this doctrine have been men of one essence: some combination of idealist materialism and dialectical materialism. Ernst Mach was of these ideas; he was also the one who, in a paper which has gone unnoticed, attempted to show that the universe is an ordered collection of particles arranged in a definite space. This paper, I think, deserves quotation only as an expression of a fundamental truth: the

Dialogis historia literaria literarum literatura".

The following pages are taken from Chapter XIX of the Lesli Linkoping NHLI (1965):

"Briefly, the subject of time in literature is twofold. On one hand, there is the subject of the relations existing between two things at any one time; for example, the fire in a chest and the ice in water. These relations are the present and the past, the visible and the invisible, something going on in space at the moment of perception. At the same time, however, there are relations which do not pertain to the tangible present, relations which take place in the future. These relations are thought and imagination. Imagination, or future thought, is the kind which involves thinking things which are quite remote in time, things which are not immediately prior to the present, things which take place some time in the future. Such relations as these are called archetypes, after the division of the Greek alphabet, which indicates the general terms which may be used in describing them. The archetypes which we have just mentioned are archetypes of thought, and we shall have them shortly. At the present moment, the future is already past; the present is already immediate. However, in all probability there exist moments when a thing is not directly prior to another, in which the two are not directly prior to man and in which the two have regard not to the tangible present but to an indefinite succession of dream variables which in the dreams of men are not absolute but relative. These moments are called twilight and dawn."

"The archetypes thus foreseen are called night and day. The archetypes thus avoided are called twilight and dawn."

"The archetypes which we have just mentioned are called thought and imagination. Thought and imagination are not archetypes, for thought and imagination are not thought and are not predicated of thought and imagination. They occur at other moments in the universe, in other individuals. They are reflexes of unconscious will, operations of the paraclete, as Hesiod would say. They are nondescriptions, interminable winds which the Paraclete performs in secret. These winds are not archetypes; they do not have the power to typify the things accomplished, to typify the moments of the universe. They are not operations of the paraclete. They are operations of the unconscious. They are operations of the subconscious. They are

Dialog; but it would be a vast error to suppose that this former form, which was at one time universal and at another local, is now forever changing. We are now in the twelfth century; the Copernican system has won out; the Copernicans have admitted a new principle: that the apparent positions of the heavens (i.e., the eccentricities of the annual and meso-mesogonic equinoxes) must be eccentricities in some other way; that the real positions are not. (This proposition was formulated by Leibniz; Galileo refuted it, but he too was refuted by another principle: the principle of equivalence. The Copernicans have won again: the real positions are not; they have been derived from a principle which has been derived from a principle.)

Of what use is it to list all the absurdities of the Copernicans? Let us take just one: they defend that the parts of the moon must be the same for all; this is a mere metaphysics; they teach it without reference to astronomical reason; the astronomical reason demands that the apparent and imaginary parts of the moon be the same. They teach it without reference to the law of gravitation; it is enough to compare their system with that of Aristotle; they will see that the former is unlimited, and makes many absurdities.

They teach that the apparent and imaginary parts of the moon must be the same for all; this is a mere metaphysics; they teach it without reference to astronomical reason; the astronomical reason demands that the apparent and imaginary parts of the moon be the same. They teach it without reference to the law of gravitation; it demands a negative law: if they can prove that the apparent and imaginary parts of the moon must be the same for all, then the apparent and imaginary parts must be the same for all. This demand is unjust; they have no right to demand it; it is self-evident; they have violated, not only the art of rhetoric, which demands a distinction, but also the dignity of art. The honor of rhetoric is not absolute; it is conditional; it is always open to such frauds. It is possible that in some way the alleged illuminations of the philosopher are valid; but if that possibility does exist, I, as the possessor of a certain patrimony of the earth, have the right to determine whether or not these illuminations are legitimate.

The Immortal Fields



The woodpecker's nest was of no practical importance; it was sufficient for the genii to create a labyrinth of their own making about it. Arrived at the place chosen by them, they found that a secret gate led nowhere; they also discovered that they were in a prison. They begged for mercy, they cursed the odious master, the unknowable moon; at last, amid shouts of "torture!" and of the "Angel of Death," they were led out. They spent the night in confusion; the next day the genii boundless magnificence had to be conceded. They gathered their valuables (which were apparently their lives) and departed, to be again summoned some day by some other master.

They traveled over very high and very low places; they descended vast halls; they were rivalled by individuals; one of the genii (who was no longer the same individual who had led them to confusion the day before) discovered that he could read in a mirror. He was compelled to choose between death and that other misery, love. He chose the misery of making others miserable.

He discovered (and this he had done many times before) that he could communicate only by sign language. He created in vain a system of idiom. He invented absurd terms: "savage," "arachnid," "limpid fluid" (a vain exercise in borrowed synonyms). He created for others, in Greek and in Italian, the impressions of a second tongue, but he also gained, for those he wanted to communicate with a foreign one. He discovered, in an undemocratic manner, that it was profitable to be unintelligible. He discovered (and this as well) that the more unintelligible a thing is made to appear to the mind, the more it will naturally be accepted by that thing's perceiver as its own. . . He discovered (and this as well) that a coin, a crown, is, in the estimation of the divinity, not the sole thing that matters.

The Wall and the Discworld



A wall separates Heliopolis from the misty lands of dream. Men have lived in solemn ignorance of these lands, where the monstrous ox is not enormous and the vile dog is not devouring men's faces. The Chinese say the earth is flat; I say it has mountains on either side and a wall along the whole length of it. (The Indians say that on one of the four corners of the earth a snake devours men who repeat a word; I say a wall.) . . The wall divides our imaginations. Now all that hard work of illusion and betrayal which we call Wall Street does not exist in my garden.

Ingrained Concluçions

I have now written a few words about the various imperatives which compelled me to discontinue the series. Now it is necessary to recall them and to expound the imperatives which finally compelled me to resume it.

The first is obvious: the work in progress, Preparatione alimentaria, is of supreme importance. Without it, this lengthy narrative would be a mere legend, a device of the mind, a story told by a dreamer, a mere verbal inventory of the country's most
====================
Dialoges of the Ancients, I have already mentioned the Chaldee Enigma, the Hanifite Anno symbol, the Citronella and the Carolingian Quadrille. These symbols, when used in perfect order, produce mirror images, but the Duhem method makes use of coincidences, of accidental links in time and space.

The Duhem method is not new. It dates from the first years of the nineteenth century. Hugo Grotius, the Swiss logician and idealist, postulated a method of cognition analogous to that of the Egyptians or the Yogis; he reasoned that the five sensory perceptions (vertex, texture, solidity, form) are supplied by a nerve fibula which in the athame or bosom of the woman who makes a love sing is a logical fallacy. This hypothesis, though it is ancient, has not given way to practice. The mystics and the ancients distinguish three vocations: intuition (thefo), deduction (ante), naming (nomen), which last requires a calendar and the use of symbols. I prefer the opinion of a single man: the artisan, the crafter, the smith. He makes objects of any particular color, any particular size, any particular of length or of width. He makes use of one or more tools or implements. He lives in a state of ceaseless union with nature. Let him say or do, say or do not say, is sufficient.

If we turn from philosophy to practical considerations, we shall find that the Duhem method is identical with that of the Hindus. They divide the world into three equal parts, which constitute a circle, and two uncircular extremes. Gold, for example, is found in twenty-four per cent. of the brahmans; among the tinkerers is found that the average number of hours a day spent in thought and contemplation of the objects of his thought is not less than ten and not more than one. The fire in the north is the benchmark by which all else is measured. According to the tenets of the sect, the activity of gold digging does not warrant censure; among the makers of coins gold is found whose sole virtue is its rigidity. Hegelsbach, in his Comptes Rendus numerabilis de la Pluralité (1899), sets forth the Duhem method in a purely physiological sense: thedigestsubjectus. . . He bases this
====================
Dialog.

The proofs I have mentioned, as I have said, are mere analogies, analogous to those used by Hume in order to save us from the absurdity of supposing that a circle is a single unit infinite in all points, and infinite in one particular direction. I venture to suggest, however, that the mere fact of constructing them should justify us in assuming that they really refer to the subject. Let us consider an example. Suppose I am asked whether it is reasonable to suppose (as is often done) that the heavens and the earth are piles of stones, arranged in a circle, and that from this pile there flow rivers or other things. My answer is absolutely prepotent; it is sufficient for me to witness it with my eyes. I shall not try to give an exact illustration; let us take one adapted to our time. A certain Josef Pieper (the eminent Pieper) once attempted to make a triangle of 23 parts double of itself. He did not succeed; the resulting object is wavering in the air; let us say it is of the air of now 18. Let us assume it is of the air of now 18. Let us assume also that this 18th part is of the air of now 20. Let us assume also that its two twentieth parts are of the air of now 20/18. Let us imagine that the resulting substance is identical with the present one, but with two extra protons. We shall get there. Now the fact that the propositions in a triangle are prepotent and the resulting object wavery in the air does not prove that the opposites did not combine to make it. It only proves that the product which we measure as a triangle does not contain the original unity. The fact that the product does contain the original unity does not prove that the two accidental accidentalities composing it do not exist. They which comprise it are not annihilated. Their imponderables are not lost. They which comprise it are not annihilated. Their imponderables are not lost. The sum of their numbers, the quintessence, I believe, is infinite. The sum of their numbers, 3,154,717, which is also the power of 2 , is infinite. Infinity, then, does not divide evenly; it divides abysmally.

Suppose I ask you, in what particular direction is the face to be perceived? You will answer, of course, the first. I repeat,
====================
Dialog (I, 6, 17) would seem to deny this fundamental fact.

We shall never know for certain the nature of the planetary composition; it is more probable that, from the moment of its dimiscovery, the entire system was suspect. Its fundamental laws, its principle of a stationary or transverse orbit, seem to have been discovered; it is possible that, during the long process of discovery, one of the basic laws was lost or misunderstood; that, during the same process of discovery, another of the basic laws was discovered that was also misunderstood or lost. In that case, the entire system — continents, oceans, sky, atmosphere, rocks, trees, animals, man — could have been a mistake, a product of chance or of design. Or it could be that all that has been discovered is not to be found; that now only one basic law governs the cosmos and that law is capable of explaining everything.

The "Pluto of the Plates" theory (Borges, 1942, p. 529) seems to me the most plausible; it seems to me that, during the nearly four centuries since Plato's day, the earth's surface, with its limited number of fixed points, is sufficient to form the framework for a spherical or "perfect" globe; that the arrangement of the points allows for a sphere's radius to become apparent, to become a circle in the mind of the spectator, but not in reality. The "Pluto of the Plates" theory (Borges, 1942, p. 532).

Perhaps the most obvious application of the theory is the Cartesian dualism of Spengler (see Däniká 9, 1950): for Cartesian dualists, the world is a single and indivisible whole; for Borgesians, the world is a highly specialized collection of specialized points. Cartesian dualists conceive of the whole as consisting of all present times, things, and forms; for Borgesians, the whole consists of all past, present, and future moments. The theory of Hladik (see also Guth, 1884) corresponds to Cartesian dualism exactly; it holds that the whole is the present, the moment itself. Since the past, present, and future are private qualities, Cartesians (and indeed all men) understand to mean only the present moment. But since all personal qualities are relative, they also mean only the present. According to Borgesians
====================
Dialogion (or caduceus)

The so-called "caduceus" is a tripartite sphinx that derives its name from the fact that the tops of the petals curve in a circle. It is a symbol of divinity, of geometry, of time. In Greek and Latin mythology, the sphinx is a triangle that points to the third dimension. In Egypt, the sphinx is the sun, or the god Ra.

In the olden days, I once went to see the man who made the sphinx. He was a tall, thin-bearded fellow who had a curious red mustache. I donned my golden chain and led him into the dark gallery. He pointed to a patch of grass several feet in diameter. "Here it is," he said. "A quarter turn and it is clear." He pointed to a depression in the grass. "Here it is a fourth turn farther along the grass, and it is also clearly marked." He pointed to another depression in the grass. "Here it is a quarter turn further along the grass, and a little further along as well," he said. "That's the thickness of the paint," I said. "It's a quarter turn too thick for the quarter turn depression in the grass," he said. "Half a turn," I told him. "Half a turn too thick for the half a turn depression in the grass," he said. "Half a turn," I told him. "One and a half," he said. "One and a half," he said. "One and a half," he said. "Three and a half," he said. "Three and a half," he said. "Two and a half," he said. "Two and a half," he said. "One and a half," he said.

"And now, the labyrinth of Oriented Kreuznach," I said.

"The labyrinth of Oriented Kreuznach," he said.

I thought for a moment. I repeated to myself once again that the man had just spoken the noble phrase: "The labyrinth of Oriented Kreuznach." Then I realized that the man was repeating it to me.

Then I understood.

I felt as if I were the one who constructed the labyrinth. I was the one who distinguished the possible directions, the directions of the labyrinth.


====================
Dialog{x:0}}

This "work" is a collection of short stories, published in various magazines and bookshops in the United States between 1932 and 1935. I have translated some of the earlier pieces, though I know of no publisher who would allow the publication of these untitled, unnumbered pieces. They are, as I have said, "in the form of short stories." The stories heretofore given have been published in the anthology The Young American , edited by Irving Thaler and Theodore Dreiser. The latter three have also edited other anthologies of American and international fiction, such as The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and Analog .

The anthology's first volume, "Fiction for Writers of All Experiences," contains the stories "The Garden of Forking Paths" and "Distant Relations" (1933). The stories in these volumes do not agree with one another, but they do agree remarkably well with one another about the general atmosphere of the magazine's offices and in certain places with the general outline of the stories "The Passion" and "The Secret in Plates" (1934). In other stories (such as "The House of Peladius" and "The Immortal" 1934) the story lines diverge a great deal.

The second volume of "Fiction for Writers of All Experiences" contains "The Woman Hunter" (1937). This is the story which won the 1939 contest at the Rome anthology. This is also the story which gave rise to the illusory contest, "Judas Iscariot," which the New York jury decided in the favor of the night before it was to begin. The title character is the wife of the hero, played by Alfred Molina.

The stories in the third volume of "Fiction for Writers of All Experiences" have the effect of making the themes more or less intelligible. These are "The Garden of Forking Paths," "The Pilgrimage to the Cave of Gloucester" and "The Immortal." "The Secret in Plates" and "The Pilgrimage to the Cave of Gloucester" have parallel passages in the "Pilgrimage" and "The Immortal." "The Immortal" has a similar procedural structure to "The Garden of Forking Paths."

The fourth volume of "Fiction for Writers of All Experiences" contains "Judas" and another story, "The

Dialog, or any other book, consists of an infinite series of distinct ideas. But in all ideas there is a common center, a point at which the multiplicity of the ideas is completed. In the books of Suárez there is no such center; each of the ideas is infinite, the multiplicity completes in us as in the waters of a well.

"In the works of the highest quality there are also such centers. I know of those in particular places and with certain people. I know also of those which are universal and in all situations possible. Thus, in the universe there are objectively possible ideas, but only in certain individuals does there exist objectively possible space, time, and identity. . . Let there be a book, then, an absolutely perfect book, and if I am right enough able without human effort to make out the figure in the margin, I shall know that the book is the one I am holding and that I have not come across another. This possibility, this book, is the authentic book; this book, the one I am looking for, is the one I am preparing. Knowing these two things, Suárez could no longer think in terms of a perfect book; he said he knew the entire book and that he had not come across it. This shows that he was able to think in terms of an idea which is no longer a book, an idea complete with its own history, its own dialect, its own gender, its own style, but is only a book."

Such were the words of Lázn. He was not a philosopher but a peasant, a tlön-tlön-clerk, an itinerant wanderer. His disciples retorted that his words were incontrovertible, that his was not even a dialectical argument; Lázn answered that he only displayed the possibility of appealing to the Argumentative Force, that is, the Intuition of God, in order to the destruction of the natural books.

Such were the words of the monk Lázn; Lázn was a Martyr and a Lázn could be a Martyr and an itinerant wanderer. He reasoned that in order to merit eternal life one must be a Martyr and an itinerant wanderer, that is, one and the same person. He reasoned that in order to be offered eternal life one must be a Martyr and an itinerant wanderer, that is,
====================
Dialog (1660)). The text is idealist in spirit: it proposes to "describe the universe in all its relations" (1702). It is a kind of "monadology" in that it is impossible to know what the "monads" (the "ordinances" of the universe) will be like without creating them; the only way to know, in such a monadology, is to know them already. The "ordinances" of the universe are the "monads" of mathematical induction, of which there are many.

Alethea thinks that this idealism is a necessary condition of the poetry of the Georgics. The poetry of the Georgics is "not a mere limping shadow of the language of antiquity"; it is not a mere phantom of the poetry of the Eleatic wars; it is not vain and trivial and superficial vanity and triviality. It is, as she says, the "true poetry" of the third century of the Theban Empire. It is the poetry of Pythagoras, Chrysippus, and their disciples, whose work is best known in Zen koineko ("Discourses of Nichiren the Reformer") and their commentary on it (third century ce Thessalian dialect verse). Zamasaku says that the Zen masters taught that all things are continuous and that time is but a transitory phenomenon. They taught that all phenomena are produced by an Absolute which is infinitely perfect and that the way to understand this perfection is through a monadology of divinatory and symbolic images, each of which symbolically symbolizes a part of the perfections of the Absolute. This teaching, Alethia thinks, allows us a glimpse of the wisdom of age and the blindness of cosmological darkness; if so, what wisdom, Alethia ponders.

I have mentioned the poem by Zamaaku ("Third Century A.D.") and have also heard that he likewise refuted Cosmologicalcosm and that of Caesars of Persia for him to do so in the East was no less arduous and wonderful than in the West. I think the same of Aletheia Sosnowaya, whose "Mythology of the Gods" is "different from all the others of that period in that it does not try to fit together a complete, logical theology but rather to produce in our heads the numerous and coherent beings which are the fathers and mothers of the universe" (Aletheia,
====================
Dialogical] Thinkers do not imagine their task is easy, to say the truth. They imagine that all that is known is already so known that it no longer matters whether it is so known or not.

What is known is that the human species is declining. We are like the Paleolithic inhabitants of the fabled city of Ur in whose ruins the Book of Rites was deposited thousands of years ago. The belief in its universal value and in the power of its agents to liberate men from their bonds of slavery prevails. There is widespread agreement that the present state of the world is the result of a series of vicissitudes which we cannot foresee or which we can't possibly play. History is a maze in which all men lose their true place; it is also for all of us a prize, an unending web of webs and wires which we can play our part in tangibly altering. The Pyrrhonians indulge in a kind of idealist mysticism, in the belief that our fate is a gift from the gods and that every effort is indeed well and good, but that there is more at work in every successful effort than is revealed to the deceiver.

Other thinkers, like the Anglo-Americans David Hume and John Stuart Mill, maintain that the real problem is not the history of the universe, not even the past, but our very nature. We are a book made of past memories, they maintain; our very being is predestined to decay as is the ground we walk on, as is the language we speak, as is the part we take up when we change places with the next. Theorems like these seem almost incredible to me, since they seem to demand a new science or ideal order which does not even know what a book or a system of books are. The very concept seems to me absurd. We are fragments of a past which once existed, a system of pasts or libraries of pasts which in turn were collections of collections of pasts. Each collection was its own library, each library was its own telephone book. The library as a whole was the personality which operated the whole operation, the individual whom the collective memory remembered as a successful individual. Man, as such, was no more complex than the collections of individual memories which made up his personal system of memories.

====================
Dialog . prototype . next = function () { this . _next = this ; }; var Text = function () { return this . _text ; }; Text ( " hello world " ); // => "hello world"

Note that the prototype chain is lexical; if we dereferenced one of the prototype fields, the compiler would dereference the rest of the prototype chain.

So far so good. But how do we map a function's parameters to its return values? Consider the following function:

var x = 4 ; function f ( a ) { return a + a ; } function g ( b ) { return g ( b ); }

The syntax of the f and g functions is the same; the difference lies in the way the parameters are bound. In the function f , the return value is an object of type ArrayRef , which has three elements a , b and c . In the function g , the return value is an object of type FunctionRef , which has three elements a , b and c . The syntax of the two functions is different: in the function f , the return value is an object of type FunctionRef , which has three elements a , b and c . In the function g , the return value is an object of type FunctionRef , which has three elements a , b and c .

The problem is this: how can we translate f(3) into g(3) ? The obvious answer is to translate the function signature from Function to Object :

var f = function () {}; var g = function () {}; console . log ( f ()) // "f" => "f" , // "g" => "g" // "h" => "h"

But this leads to a paradox: if one were to create an infinite List object, one would have to create each element of the List's elements array twice: once for each List , like so:

var a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]; console . log ( a ). length // 3

and once again for the FunctionRef a :

var f = {}; function g ( b ) { return b + a }; function h ( a , b ) { return a + b }; console . log ( g ( a , "hello world" ))) // "hello world" // console . log ( g ( a , "world" , "hello world" ))) // "world

Dialog.

"I have seen it, my dear sir; but no one else has either seen it more clearly or felt its gravity, either in his own memory or in that of his companions. It is this: There was a tree in the middle of the square; on that tree, at that moment, Jove dictated to his god the universe as it actually was. The tree represented the earth; Jove, the heaven and the universe represented the earth. At that moment, the gods ceased to be and the universe became man."

I asked him if he could recall any other instance in the cosmos of a decisive act that did not influence the future, but rather informed it. He hesitated, then said:

"There was the coming into being of the visible earth. Aided by a wave force comparable to that generated by the waves on the sea, it was preparing to throw off the iron bands. The waves were succeeding in confusing the pre-tied iron bands with free bands; this confused state was beneficial to the mental preparation. The mental preparation? The oxen and men. The mental preparation? Extinction."

I felt I had made an objective discovery. I felt, Niccolò, that we were a people pure of prejudices, and that we had come exactly as we were, into this world, prepared, as already remarked, by mental preconditions. We had eliminated them, we still retained certain prejudices, such as that of the oxen, which we had discarded, and those of the color of the skin. This elimination, I thought, is not incompatible with the idealist school; it is sufficient. Let man become master of his fate; the very fact of existing is enough. Let him be everything: the sun, the moon, the fish, the animal. Let him love not only his physical form, since this would be meaningless, but also the metaphysical form of the universe. Niccolò said this would eliminate the necessity for metaphysics, since the universe existing in man exists in him, regardless of his phenomenal form.

Then I understood, for I felt that every man, in this way, was a god. God? Yes, god; man, his image, his likeness. Niccolò added that the idealist school held that the universe is a series of perceived intemporal relations, relations that are not objective, not personal, not spiritual; that the world, the
====================
Dialog--is a sound analysis which bases its judgment of the text upon its content and its rhetorical device. I shall try to apply this analytical rigor to the first part of the opera, and to the remainder of the text.

The first scene opens with a prologue, or foreshadowing. We have seen that the play is a prelude to a revolt in Austria, and that the leader is the Countess of Würzburg (Mariupa). The Countess has just returned from a visit to England, where she had been the recipient of much public attention. During the evening, she had received a telegram from Berlin, in which it was mentioned that a private duel had taken place in the outskirts of the city. The cries of alarm caused by that terrible news could be heard throughout the residential neighborhoods of Vienna; there was no time to receive that news fairly; the Countess knew full well that her hour of greatest public attention was at hand. Her carriage waited quietly in the lot of the Domergue; the chauffeur waited anxiously along the winding streets; the tall, dark countenances of the Listeße listened with anxious eyes to the clamor of the tires; they waited anxiously, too, for the soft, melodious horse-whistle of the chauffeur's announcement that his passenger should now remain in the passenger's room. The chauffeur left the lot; the Countess' carriage slowly neared the house where the duel had taken place. . . Her heart nearly stopped at that sight; she felt herself approaching, perhaps somewhat unrealistically, the threshold of her palace. Her father, her brothers and herself rode in the passenger's seat; behind them, the hum of the car and the soft whistle of the horse. The Countess felt, first dazed, the necessity of increasing the tempo of her breathing; then intense, concentrated, almost mechanical, an overpowering desire to remain standing. She took a deep, tentative breath; the horse's hoof knocked the fabric of her robe. A violent knot in the fabric separated into two halves; the effect was exactly that of a noose. She raised her eyes to meet the glare of the blazing halo. In the midst of the duel she had only seen its outline; now she saw it almost perfectly: the scar, the knot, the gaping wound, more precisely outlined in the blood, the noose, the blazing through the
====================
Dialog, for instance, is a kind of speech. It is not a verbal expression; it is a moral attitude or attitude of mind. The mental state must be an essential part of the work in order to be called a poem. Poetry is not a formal art, but a pragmatic art, a rhetorical art. The mind must be capable of all styles and of all sciences, of all modes of expression. Thus language and poetry, Latin and Aristotelian philosophy, are but formalisms, superficial but essential. All styles and sciences are valid in poetry, just as all formalisms are valid in rhetoric. Schopenhauer called this essentiality of the poetic mind: "It only proceeds from the fact that all things in it are the poet. Everything else is mere metaphor or deferrament." The "poem" or the "illustrious man" is the logical subject of its logical thought. Schopenhauer observed: "An illusory man thinks he is a man; an illusory poem, a poem in words." And again: "We are in the poet, not the words." The poet is the logical subject of the poem.

The tradition of Schopenhauer goes that a priori reason should determine that poem should have certain emphases; poetic intent should be a priori. Schopenhauer held this position to be "mere fancy," a mere "faculty" of the intellect. However, the tradition of Schopenhauer does not hold that an illusory man thinks he is a man; rather, he is a man in so far as he thinks he is Schopenhauer. The tradition of Schopenhauer holds that such a poem is capable of all styles and sciences of expression. The poem is illusory in so far as it is a mere rhetorical device, a kind of cloak-and-dagger game, a game of illusion. (This last distinction is the subject of the last chapter of the Grundlagen.) Schopenhauer held that such a poem is capable of all styles and sciences of expression.

====================
Dialog.

A million years before, we read in the Koran that the universe is nothing but a series of principles, invisible and intangible, which in time and space converge to a single principle, the Divinity. This passage, which is found in the Zuhd and Zuhair schools of thought, explains how the universe could have begun, how it can last, and how it will end. The philosophers of old understood that the first principle was the world, the world is the universe. The world is a reflection of the principle principle, which is a principle of reflection. The world is a principle of reflection which, through a process of reflection, becomes a principle of matter. The world is a principle of matter which, through a process of matter, becomes a principle of spirit. The world is a principle of spirit which, through a process of spirit, becomes a principle of time. The world is a principle of time which, through a process of time, becomes a principle of space. The world is a principle of space which, through a process of space, becomes a principle of time-space. The Vuiddeen, the philosophers of old, understood that the first principle is the world, the world is the universe. The universe is a reflection of the universe, which is a reflection of the Vuiddeen. The universe is a reflection of the universe, which is a reflection of the Vuiddeen. The future is a part of the past; the past a portion of the future; the future a part of the present; the present a portion of the tenuous notion of time. The Essai sur l'histoire naturelle, Aldous Huxley, I read in the Discourse on the History of Philosophy, contains the following formula: "The world is an idea in our heads; the world is an event in our lives; the world is a succession of ideas in our heads which in time arrive at a monarch in heaven." This world is a mere logical elaboration of the things we believe; it is not, as is sometimes the case, a perfect confirmation of the things we imagine; it is, on the contrary, a monarch of evils.

The world, according to the Buddhists, is a series of formations, nous, or constituents, which concatenate into a single whole, aggregate into aggregates, objects into beings, the dual of which is never to be found. We speak of the world as consisting

Dialog

He who seeks perfection in all things will find it nowhere; he who seeks it in a bird or in a person will find it in the universe.

Friedrich Nietzsche

The central problem of all philosophy is the existence of reality. If reality were non-existence, nothing would be and nothing would be nothing. But this non-existence is what reality is; it is the intelligible condition of things. The world is the conjunction of these conditions. The world is the effect of chance, the product of the accidents of space, time and the complex relations of the mind. The world of the Plot objects is no better than the world of the blind men who have their memories is bad. The world of chance events is no worse than the world of present and future events.

The world is no less real than the world of the little blind men who sit around a fire.

All transcendental metaphysicians deny this; for the fireflies in Descartes' flames, Hermes Trismegistus, deny their reality. But chance events do not exist in the way that they are represented; they spring into the world of chance reflections, d'après tristin, which is metaphysically inadequate. We can see this in the Tetragramdists, who assert that their scriptures actually represent all the possible positions of the trinity; but this positing is no less an element in the fabric of the Tao than is the trinity. All idealists will admit that the world is composed of states of nothingness or colorless absence; but this absence ― which is what reality is if it were non-affect ― is what the world of chance reflections is. The world is nothing without a name; for this empty absence a name is proper. The world is the imagination of the finite mind; the name given to it would be vain and misleading.

Hermann Lotze, in his "Critique of Pure Reason," rejects the Cartesian syllogism and denies the existence of objective reality. He grounds this rejection by way of a dialectical way of negating reason. He reasons that reason can know nothing else but its object, and since the object of reason is a distinction in a divine series, that series is actual. Reason has perceived this series, as we have a wound with our eye, and that actuality is not the case, he says, since it is overlaid

Dialog (he said) in the name of the Koran. I asked him what he meant by that supplication; he told me that it was a request of them who worship in a secret place the image of a man, whose face is hidden by a turban, who governs the earth with an iron rod and who, if one of his slaves desists, is left helpless. I also learned from him that the people of that place (who follow a lunar calendar) use the year in their prayers, because that place, according to the Hindus, is inaccessible during the lunar months. Then Naji Savjid Ali Mujahid (who after several misfortunes became the "Mukhya of Central Asia") began to speak in these terms:



In the beginning there was Muḥammad, in the beginning God, in the beginning time there was a blind man, there were giants, there were Arabs, there were Jews and there were Persians. The blind man was the result of chance, the result of a division of the stone into pieces that reduced him to a blind humanity. The blind man was given over to sorrow, to melancholy; the blind man gazed at the barren land and imagined that it were he who planted it and that only he were the one growing and harvesting it. The blind man dreaded uncertainty and sought for an anchor established in probability. . . The years brought change and comfort. The first seasons were dry and cold and dry, and the last (the richness of summer) was exquisite and divine. . . He recalled the names of the months and the deities of the seasons; then he remembered that the years had become months.

This Naji Nure, speaking of the years, spoke of years in a circular manner, speaking of years in circular terms. He sought for an anchor in probability. . . He thought: "If a nation has lived through the ages, it has also died." He thought: "There is nothing new in the fact that one man has vast accomplishments and vast responsibilities." He spoke of the corruptibility of kings and the inevitability of crime.

Then there was the case of the "giganticities of the Tigris and Euphrates." These "gigantic" (as the Hindus would say) rivers, these "incomparably vast" navigable seas, were the judgments of a blind man whose exact knowledge was unimpeachable. They were said to exist because

Dialog, that eternal discourse, in which the Gods of the poets and metaphysicians of old would meditate; and this eternal discourse the modern world has abandoned.

I am no more ignorant of the Vedas than I am of my native State, or of that State's frontier. I have read them; I know the order; I know its points; a few journeys from this order, however, a space of thirty days' travel, will allow me the distinct privilege of admitting the most unexpected hypothesis: the possibility that the writings of various authors, submitted to different hands, may have been transposed into some arbitrary form by some one submitting them to the periodical "Vedanta" ― which was, after all, the work of many men ― and that this form submitted it to the readers of the monthly. My humble supposition, perhaps absurd, though I believe I have rendered it more agreeable.

From this conjunction of time and place it may be departed with to wonder whether I have also transversed that other slippery and opaque frontier: that of the impure. I have traversed it; I suspect I already do. I have examined the compartments of countless typewriters; I have examined the stimulators and depressives and antiprogesters which, under the right circumstances, may be found in any pharmacy. I have palpated the smooth muscle of any criminal; I have found it impossible not to be struck dumb by cold, anger and forgetfulness. I have observed it in the faces of the students of philosophy; I have observed it in that of the professors of mathematics; I have noted it in that of the patients of the conventual hospital; I have observed it on the faces of those patients; I have now seized that mysterious opportunity which is the endearing about every man: the opportunity of finding out whether your faces belong to those of other men. Can you not be astonished that I should be able to give you such and such a name? Can you not be astonished that I should be able to give you such and such a dialect?"

The man's eyes filled with mysterious colors.

Fragment 3: (Cantos, Syria, or Cyprus?)



Plutarch speaks of the "city of the troglodytes," that is of Thessaly; but Thesprotos, the "city of the troglodytes" is not the citadel of Limbo; nor is it the Æonian island of Lesbos. The city of the troglodytes is the universal city; it is the earth, the seas, the stars, the firmament, the firmament in its four quarters, the firmament in its four directions; it is the fluid, the solid matter, the solid matter in its four dimensions; it is the solid body which receives the motion of the fluid in four directions and reciprocates that motion with the motion of the liquid in another direction. The fluid and solid matter are the ideas which the Platonic philosopher has conjured up from diverse images: the ether is the figure of speech, the air the figure of speech; the air, the idea of air, is the ether; the air, the idea of air, is the solid matter, the ideas of copper, gold, silver, lead, brass, lead and lead-all figures of speech. . . There is nothing new in these tortuous metaphors; what is new is the attempt, in the enlightened countries, to make them intelligible to the mind of the the stupid. These illusory airy metaphors, this brutishness of tone and form, have brought us, at the end of the eighteenth century, the most exquisite and impressive descriptions of the earth; more excellent, I understand, because they are as unreal to the mind as they are to the mind's perceptible texture. . .

Socrates, aeons ago, taught that the world is hollow; Ambrose, aeons ago, taught that the stars are shadows of the world; Nicomachean left, centuries ago, those theological and neo-theological maxims which affirm that the Form and the Extents of Form are one and the same substance, whose Substance is the Divinity. In France and in Germany, a century of reason has given rise to quite different conceptions of the world. The empiricists affirm that everything, even the odious demon-traps, is a
====================
Dialog;



With my eyes closed, I dreamt I was a blind beggar in a Turkish castle, my back to the burning city, the walls black with dead and dying Turks. I heard the rustle of leaves and the rustle of a dog, then the howl of wind and the crash of stone. I awoke in a cold dungeon filled with iron bars, leather, leaden objects and a fire. I asked the witch for water and salt and she gave me bread and water. I lay down to sleep, afraid of the Turks.

My companions asked me questions, but I couldn't remember them. I wondered if the stone in front of my eyes was a door or a lamp post. I wondered if the dog was going to bite me. Suddenly, I remembered my purloined cloak. I put it on and went to the door. I had better doors guarded with iron; I knocked without luck. Suddenly, I remembered the dog. I put the cloak back and went out.

The rain was falling harder. I thought of the useless way we used to get into the castle. I thought of the dog and the red, wet cloak. I reasoned that the rain must have stopped, or the aperture in the bars must be the proper exit. I went out, thinking that I heard the stairs.

I came upon a damp stone wall. I knocked and a tall, naked man turned around. I put a hand on his shoulder, telling me I was the landlord of the cobbler's shop across the street. He showed me to the other side of the wall.

"This is the barred door leading to the dungeon," I said. "I hope you are Percival or Percius Rufus."

The man answered with an air of indifference ― semi-comical, I know ― and I left him, turning the key in the lock. It seemed impossible to me to leave Percival or Percius Rufus to that fate, but ― truth be told ― I had no time to waste speculating. On the last day of November, 1918, the last soldier's bullet had broken my shoulder.

To the other cobbler's shop ― whose name I could not decipher ― I went: the man who was my friend's had been wounded. I showed them to the repaired bullet which I had in my pocket that morning, and I went out: the rain
====================
Dialog, I should add, in accordance with the general dictum (which no doubt dates back to Plato) that an inscription is better than no inscription at all. It is, first, a visual image, a symbol, a template, a vocabulary, a poetic device, a rhetorical device. The problem is not in creating that vocabulary but in carrying it out. The Palil ang Calamity was not a poetic text but a mechanical. The vocabulary was insufficient; the work was not a manual but a sort of hortatory exercise. The Palil ang Calamity was not a manual but a sort of recreational computer. The fact is that, in the last decades of the nineteenth century, the written word lessened not only in terms of its literal connotation (treasure, treasure) but also in its symbolic meaning (words, English, English). The meaningless English of the times became, more and more, the meaninguous English of the times. In the novels of Edward Brooke, for example, the English country houses and the jaywalking tourists of Leigh's Peak have become not only the malignant city of 1915 but also a country house and jaywalking tourists of 1899. At the same time, the real country houses became almost mythical, became parables. The collier became the tourist. The innkeeper became a traveler. The detective had the mark but the habits of the detective and the habits of the traveler. The detective's mark was his book and his habits were his book and his notebook. These three new details were, in a way, confirmation and confirmation of the others. The fact that they were not used to perfection confirmed and strengthened our idea that these novelistic devices were mere reading and not creative processes.

A little while later I received a telegram from Berlin. It was from the owner of an unlikely topic of conversation: the discoverer of a secret vault in the Alps. The story went that a certain young mountain man, one Stuart Hogg, had discovered in the course of the many centuries of Christian civilization that all things need an ascetic and paranoid death to remain free; that is to say, that all men are variations on a theme, stages of a cosmic drama that have just one final dramatic scene, in which the hero, on a mountain top, has just one last look at the glorious play he has just a minutely conceived, has just one last look at absolute zero, in which the invisible hand of the
====================
Dialog, "the common man," speaks of "the humble, the tender, the affectless, the dreamer."

In the sixth volume of Reid's work we read of an Indian Indian, no less noble than Socrates, who "was despised by the people for having said the very opposite of what he had said, and for having done his utmost to redeem them from their sins." Socrates, we are led to believe, was an absurdist; the people "cried out that they were being robbed, they were dying in the streets." So complete was his downfall, so much the dishonor, that when he was resurrected, the people were glad he had not been their Lord and Redemption. "The sublime truth is that we are mortal, that our lives consist in the sinning and undergoing torment in the perdition of a suspended, impersonal Minute, in a moment of infinite day and infinite night." In other words, the people were glad he had said what they had never said, that is, what they now say in order to keep from saying what they never would say: that there are no gods; that all men are created equal and that every man is the center of his own universe.

In a word, our lives are but suspended miniatures of a universal drama. In the first books of Plato's Theater of Infinity, Hume ably summarizes the principal difficulties which Englishmen have committed: they attempt to discover the causes of the world's accidents, they ask whether every man is a spectator and agent of his own circumstances, or if he is only another individual in a complex ensemble of circumstances. In the foregoing pages we shall only summarize those striking instances of the ineffable in order to form a coherent doctrine. . . The foregoing exposition of the divine paradoxes, which are almost incomprehensible to the uninitiated, is sufficient to convince us that the divine paradoxes are nothing less than a revelation of the divine. The more tranquil and collected our thought, the more astounding and miraculous do the divine paradoxes seem to us.

Let us consider a few of them.

The first concerns the distinction between personal and universal laws. Hume argues that for any law P to be personal it has to be deducible cogmatically from some nonpersonal essence, e.g. a circle, a solid, a circle from which it is numerically distinct. For a law to be universal it must hold for all times and for all places.
====================
Dialoges, sophists and theologians of every party use the term "religious experience." It is always used in the broad sense of all religious experiences, and not in the narrower sense of religious convictions. German Idealism, which for so long a while reigned, was but the most conspicuous expression of this generalization.

The term "religious experience" is no less ambiguous than that of "earthly experience." Many men and women of good will endeavor to make a complete recovery of reason and moral rectitude out of the universe; some (such luminaries as Lange, Danto, Hartung and Hartung) go so far as to affirm (for want of a better term) the "aura teraphimonia" or "aura of reality" (van Lordkloet, 1897, p. 79); others (Kleine-Bis) associate with Crowley (Dandy Books, 1938, serie "Thele"; Singer, Hermes Trismegistus, 1923, quarto, pp. 153-55; Liddell Hart, Thelema, 1941, quarto, pp. 176-87; Roth, Gnosticism and the Philosophy of Mind, 1947, quarto, pp. 539-52).

The term "religious experience" is, in fact, infinite. There are no scruples about the misnomer of "cerebral experience." So long as the "peripheries" or "charades" (as they are sometimes called) are there as tools for the "fundamental project," everything is religious. The "aura of reality" (which is, after all, a mental impression) allows us partial access to the "absolute" and enables us to perceive it clearly; the "aura of the labyrinths" (which is a visual impression) allows us partial access to the "absolute" and enables us to perceive it magnificently. The "aura of the labyrinths" makes it possible for Hartung to arrive at the conclusion that the universe is a projection of the mind; the "aura of the labyrinths" makes it possible for Hartung to arrive at the conclusion that the universe is a contradiction. . . It is absurd to speak of "religious experience" so long as there is anything to be said for the term "coercive experience" or "psychological experience." The fact is that no matter how "intellectually sound" a person may be,

Dialog or Shemesh; but all the while, the gentler, gentler, flatteringly Jewish Talmud continued to taunt me. One such statement dealt with the manna:

"And when the people have gathered, the manna will be thrown into the Jordan; but when they have thrown the jordan, they will see the gathered manna, which will not be thrown."

The next statement concerned the Festival of Lights, a festival of lights which would make one blind. The Jews of Arabia said that it was a festival of the dead, that is, of the material world; but the heathen Egyptians said that it was a festival of the living, of the unseen, of the incorruptible. Such is the narration of Ibn-Khattaib, who saw the dead bodies with his own two eyes.

I recall also the story of the Jews of Byzantium, a nation of which there are extant extant no less than twenty-four books; among these, a book which is written in the form of a book, and speaks in the form of a language. These words of the Ukraina speak in the form of the books of the Ukraina, and are spoken by the dead in the land of the Greeks.

I have related also the history of mankind the history of blindness, of the darkness of ignorance; I have, perhaps, offended the gods, who are jealous and cruel. But tell me, Capua, have not the gods made men enemies before? Have they not been kind to those who bore the fruit of their labours, and cursed and afflicted them so that they became like men? "Men of Perpetual Indignation," said the Lord when He punished the tower of Babel; "many I cursed, but your tower stands out as a peculiar victim."

No. Far be it from iniquity for the divine right of vengeance to extend to towers; but let it do so, so that those who suffer it may not turn into monsters those menaces of the right that are their honor.

There is no crime so ancient that it is not compatible with the altercations of philosophy; and philosophy, in a nutshell, is any solemn conceit which, in order to justify its demand, alternates the banalities of logic with the exaltations of metaphysics. For example: The Gods decree that men be girt up in mail; this is a logic

====================
Dialog (which I shall not examine) shows that the soul as such, as distinguished from the body, is only one aspect of the Absolute, a mere stratum on a vast plane of being. Both the physical and the spiritual world are but the projection of this plane, the planes are but one single infinite background. The world is but one of sundry oracular visions; the world as such is but a suggestion of another. The world is but one of countless hands; the world as such is but a synonym of another. The world is but one of minute circles on a circular earth; the world as such is but one of countless names inscribed on a circular book. . . Let us use the example of the alphabet. It is absurd to say that the letter A represents A is the name of an organic substance, or that it represents the name of a God. For the synthesizer it represents all things, for it represents the synthesis of all things. It is absurd to say that the letter O represents an absolute name. It does not. It serves as a symbol, a shorthand notation on the page, which signifies the absence of the hypostatic union, on the synthesis page. It does not signify the absence of the letter. It signifies the absence of the absence. It signifies the absence of the letter. It signifies the absence of a letter. It signifies the absence of an infinite series of letters. It signifies infinite series of absencees. It is farcical to speak of the letter A. It is absurd to use the letter A.

The second and more general operation of the synthesizer is the construction of worlds. The world is a logical construction of the mind; the world is a logical construction of the world. The world is a series of logical fallacies; the world is a series of logical foundations.

The first logical fallacy is the presumption that it is possible to think our way to a certain end. It is a fallacious presumption; it says that since our end is a constructual world, our end ought to be a logical foundation of the world. But the world ought to be a logical foundation of the world; it ought to be a necessary condition of the act of thinking it. Without a logical foundation, thought is a labyrinth, and the form of the intellectual process ought to be manifold. The world ought to be a mirror which projects itself on to the reflective surfaces of the worlds in which we think.

In the beginning was the word,

which conceives and conceals, one of two natures;



or, according to Sophocles, one of passions and imaginations, one of forms and an image, one of the rational soul and the rational soul's mirror.

" L Ibn-Shahn ponders: "What is the colour of a single eye which sees the world and its terminals?" And so on. Every discourse treats of the earth's substance; this is necessary; otherwise, the dialogue would be but the opening verse of a metaphysical treatise.

The first thing to note is that the world does not exist. The philosophers conceive it not as a constituent part of the world, which is every mind, body, and spirit contemporaneous and interdependent in space and effaced by time, but rather as a state of mind. In other words: the world is not there because it exists, but because some other mind than ours imagines it does exist. This suggests a second problem: how can the world be there, since thought and imagination are perishable and obliterate it, as all things do to the extent of ceasing to be? The Eleaticines answer that the world is perishable because its very existence is a privilege; it is not a right but a kindness, a fortunate circumstance. From this it can be seen that the world is an illusion.

Bk I of the Hypnotic Revelation Rumi composed the first part of the Hypnotic Revelation. The reason given for this decision is obscure, although Rumi himself (perhaps with the approval of Ibn Battuta) decision deduces it from a discourse of the astronomer Averroes concerning the revolutions of the sun and the moon. This discourse states that in the constellations of the zodiac the first man was the Indian, who settled down to the cultivation of the soil, and afterward the bird or beast, who lingered over the branches of the tree.

No one could surpass the Persians in folly, no one could have deluded them so many times. For three hundred years they had destroyed their academies and madrassas, and from their lofty strongholds they had issued forth over the hostile land warriors and soldiers; but one people could not be deluded by another. One legend could not fabricate the fabrication of others. There were contradictory versions of the history of Utna, of Nippur, of Atlantis; but one people did not believe in the other. One legend was accepted with pleasure, and soon invented kings and emperors followed it.

Three hundred years old now, Rumi stands before your eyes as a dark and embittered old man; but before that, he was a youthful man of thirty or forty, flamboyant in the pleasures of love and pleasure, oblivious of the weight of his enormities and yet surly and sure of his ends. He died in a cave on the fifth of Dhofar, but the incertitude of his years made him anxious and finally decisive. He knew that the battle of the mountains was won, that the river Ra would not devastate Jerusalem, that the sea would not burst, that fire and sword were the royal modes of his destiny. He knew that he was but the coda to a symphony, that the life of a bird was but the first note.

For the first time in many years I found myself in the airlock. I felt, somehow, as if I were sinking to the level of the floor. There was no mistaking the immense, silent, airlock. I opened the emergency hatch. On the floor below I saw a naked, helpless man. I thought that I had seen everything. I felt as if I were floating on air.

Then I understood: I had been a prisoner of the airlock all those years. I had been a victim of its contradictions, of its morbidity and of its youth.

I opened the emergency hatch. A few seconds later the naked man shouted, clumsily, "Help!" (I later learned that he had shouted, "Open the emergency hatch!") I opened the hatch. A few seconds later a woman's pale face, with the reddish tinge of desperation, standing in the middle of the square. A policeman, with his pistol raised, came out of the barracks. He looked at me with a helpless, hostile gray eye. Then with a small smile he acknowledged the policeman's help.

"The Gardners are after you," he said.

I recognized the voice. It was Adolf Hitler's, during his three years' siege of Antwerp. On the platform above us, the sirens were busy, but beneath the general's glare the people's shouts and the moonlight, I noticed, had a gray undertone. Around me, the terraced squares seemed smaller. The men were winning it; the last of the torches were dying down; ahead of us, out on the square, the gleam of dawn was brighter than the stars. I thought that this triumphal march, this orderly triumph, was but the beginning of an unholy war, a synonym of perdition.

Then I recognized the handwriting on the chequebook. It was that of the Gestapo, of St. Paul's.

Suddenly, without any foresight, I forgot my will to survive and my fear of death. I remembered that I already was one and that all men are mortal. I also remembered that I was Rassatzgruppen, secret agents, and that all who fall are not always the worst of men. I thought: I may not be able to prevent my comrades from doing evil, but I should much prefer it

Dialogical Journeys" and "The Magic Mountain." The latter is a poem he discovered while on a business trip to India in the early sixties. It is set in the Himalayan region and tells the story of two men who, on a journey through the night, dream that they are in a desert village and that they have found the abode of a mighty king. The narrator's dreamer awakens one morning to find himself in the desert village of a century and a half ago, and also to find that his distant past has returned, this time as the tragic figure in the dream has been.

Trotsky says that the most resplendent of all problems, the problem of time, is only theoretically possible in a work which pretends to be timeless. The problem of the imaginary past is possible only in a world in which the "imaginary past" is the present tense. The present tense, of course, is the present tense which is not "my present tér" but "the present tér of a half a century ago," which is the present tense which is not "my present tér" but "many years ago," and so on forever.

This infinite series of hypothetical pasts, this succession of identical terentines which is no less fictitious than the hypothetical pasts, is what Hegel, in the first volume of his Logik, intended to solve. He proposed to solve history with an infinite series of eternities. But this infinite series, this eternity of worlds which is no less fictitious than the pasts, is only a convenient framework within which to solve the problem. The problem is more difficult if we decompose it into two parts: one, the problem of the historical process itself; two, the problem of contingency. If the process of historical necessity is a priori known, then contingency is not. If the process of historical necessity is a priori known, then history itself is no more complex than the fragments and recombinations of contingency. If the latter are incomprehensible, the former will remain unintelligible and the universe will be an ever-shifting labyrinth of conflicting ideas.

Hermann Lotze has proposed a slightly more complex method. He says that the distinction between its intelligible parts is a "blight" which obstructs our direct perception of the whole. For him, a symbolic number is a number which has a direct significance corresponding to that number. Hence,

Dialog and the Decisive Discord.

There is nothing new in this. All history is the history of divergent paths which the mind chooses. Each person has his time, her time. The modern poet has a saying: "One sigh wipes away all tears; another, the color of dawn." To that which we can see now, add an etymological meaning, the modernist architect might add, as little as possible, historical and imaginary, poetic and historical. In this way, the differences between the different eras might be noted, and the common thread might be found in the differences.

He understood that virtue and vice are various expressions of the same theme ― the tension of being and being from within; Helena Bodénheffe explained that the two forms are antithetical. He understood that the history of the world is a double series, beginning with the fall and continuing, at the close, with the reformation. He understood that the primary object of knowledge is the Absolute, and that the two qualities we use to define the Absolute ― goodness and misery. He understood that the twofold work of art consists in distinguishing the scenes in which the Good Life follows the Good Life, and those in which it does not.

Dialog; the first, a beautiful, if incomplete chapter; the second, the exact text. The final chapter, a gloss. . . The work is two hundred and thirty pages.

The first person I saw was F. E. ford, a tall, gray-bearded fellow with a gray beard and gray eyes. He told me that he was a translator and historian of eleventh-century Icelandic sagas; that he had translated the Annals of King Arthur (1898), the Iliad (1902) and the Aeneid (1904); that he had translated the Ritterführer (1908), the Doctrine of the Novel (1911) and the Ruh ("Ten Commandments, One Work") List (1913); that he had translated Schopenhauer's Meinung (1914), Beck's Testament of Bliss (1918), Twain's Ulysses (1922) and Nabokov's Patrilinale (1924). He also stated that he was the intermediary between the Icelandic Directorate and the representatives of the Directorate at New York (D. F. A. Minneapolis, Dec. 1923).

The other men being removed to another room, I remained with the twenty or thirty blond-bearded men who had just left the library. I reflected that it was absurd to expect them to recall the full text of my note, and I returned to the subject of which they so adamantly clamored. About midnight I received a telegram from Barcelona. It read: "The Directorate has received your telegram of the twenty-ninth. The investigation has established that your letter referred to the poem entitled La biblioteca dell' un'aberichica by the name of Jeux Nicolas and not to La biblioteca by the other name."

In the first part of the telegram it read: "The Icelandic Directorate has received your telegram of the twenty-ninth. The investigation has established that the letter you addressed to the archbishop of Basel referred to the Icelandic biblioteca Nicolas and not to the bibliotropic Nicolas." In the second part it read: "The Icelandic Directorate has received your telegram of the twenty-ninth.

One note on the use of the word "if". This code uses the "for" keyword nine times, but in the preamble it says that it "uses the "if" keyword nine times". This is because the code determines if the first nine elements of a vector A are "a", "b", "c" or "d" and if they are "a", "b", "c" or "d" then it is/were necessary to determine if the nine elements of a vector B were "a", "b", "c" or "d". If they were not, the "if" keyword was not needed.

Here is the code one line at a time:

for (int i = 0; i < A.Length; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < B.Length; j++) { if (A[i] == B[j] || A[i] == B[j] && A[i] == B[k] ) break ; } }

This code is equivalent to the one I gave in the article On Lists.

Another way to write the same thing is to write it analytically. Let us consider the expression

a = b c d

The first form analyzes the word "a" and determines whether it contains only one or whether it contains three terms. In the second form, the analyzer determines whether the word "a" contains three terms or whether it contains two terms. In the first form, the analyzer determines whether the first occurrence of a in the memory B is followed by the occurrence of a , the second by the occurrence of b , the third by the occurrence of c . In the second form, the analyzer determines whether the two occurrences of the same word in the same memory A are the same as they are in memory B . In the first form, the analyzer determines whether the sequence a , b , c is repeated in memory B . In the second form, whether the

Dialog

Socrates: I hate the philosophy of the past (I said to him, when we met), which esteemed the past as something absolute, as incommunicable and outside of time. I hate the philosophy of the future, which regards the present as a series of possible moments, as a series of relations or gradations between moments. I also hate the silence of the past, which is an infinite series of states, of equilibria or non-existence, of moments which do not exist. I am all one, I am all one.

Hermann: I understand you to say that it is absurd to think of the past as possible or necessary, and that the present as an infinite series of states is a mere idealist delusion. You are quite right in the former statement. But you are not only in error regarding the past. You are also in error regarding the present as an immanent relation of time. Let us take a moment. Let us imagine that of right here, in our present city, that moment is very near. Let us imagine that the hour is clear, and that we come immediately from lunch. We must now pass from our imagination to that moment, for the moment is external to our minds. Let us imagine that a policeman stops us. He asks for your name and address, and we move to the next moment, which is internal. We think you say something, but then we perceive that you do not. Perhaps your eyes deceive us, perhaps your mouth does not. We are in the present, and the momentaries in our minds are but passing in a vast eternal process. Perhaps you see us, for example, and we move to that moment, which is external to our minds. Perhaps you hear me say something else, and I repeat it later on, after I have left. Perhaps you do not perceive our car, but we know it to be ours, for its red stripes. Perhaps you do not perceive our imprisonment, but we can be certain of one thing: our condition, now at an end, was not infinite. Perhaps you perceived this inscription on the wall, and understood that I was the representative of the faithful, and of the last and greatest of the kings of Persia, the son of Cyrus. But now reflect: who is this king, and what is his religion, his philosophy, his religion? Who are the faithful he sent away, and what are the tenets of his religion but pride,

Dialog, the Jesuits rejected it. Their rejection, however, was not final. In the first year of the twelfth century, Pope Urban II condemned the doctrine of the intercession of Jesus Christ. He did so in the sixth article of the Canis pro corde, which reads: "If anyone teaches that God intercedes in the mediatorial acts of men, as in the Scriptures, Epiphanius, Origen and others have affirmed; or that in the Acts of the Apostles he has observed, or that in the Council of Nicaea he has done, this or that miracle; or that in the sacred books of Arabia, Solomon, Akbar and others, the God of Israel is identical with that God who withdrew himself from among his people on the seventh of Im's birthday and who has three heads, the Almighty, the invisible and the incorporeal, the God of faith, the invisible and the visible, the God of faith, the God of miracles, the God of tongues, the God of cosmologies, the God of religions, the God of Jacob, the God of Egypt, the God of fire, the God of light, the God of water, the God of air, the God of earth, the God of fire, the God of rivers, the God of trees, the God of languages, the God of lights, the God of rivers, the God of languages, the God of rivers, the God of rivers, the God of rivers, the God of rivers."

The following year, Pope Urban III promulgated the document Laudative of the Intercession of the Three Nations, in which it was stated explicitly that the three nations were the Christian religion, Arabia and Christianity. This papal document was followed in 1943 by another, Laudative inter Christi, in which it was stated that the three nations are Christ. In 1949, Pope Pius IX, after many pontificates, issued his Bull of Supremacy, which instituted and expanded the Catechism.

In the fifty years since the death of Christ, the human species has multiplied at an exponential rate. Today there are four hundred and fifty million of us.

Dialog; is not this a kind of symbolic communism?

It is a kind of symbolic communism, but it is no less incomplete. It does not recognize, in the unified whole of the past, the value added by the future; it recognizes, in the unified whole of the present, the qualitative contribution of the past. It does not recognize, in the unified whole of the present, the interpenetrating of local forms; it recognizes, in the unified whole of the future, the interpenetrating of local forms that have been local forms throughout the past. It does not recognize, in the unified whole of the future, the interpenetrating of local forms that have been local forms throughout the past; it recognizes, in the unified whole of the past, the interpenetrating of local forms that have been local forms throughout the past. It is true that it is possible ― albeit extremely tenuous ― that the unified whole of the past (and the present, and the future) do not overlap. But the fact that they do not overlap is sufficient for Schelling's incomparably more cogent theory of change. In its most radical form, the theory of change says that there is no static past; on the contrary, changes take place continually through time and space. (The latter are interrelated: the former concerns the present in a temporal and/or a spatial sense.) According to the theory of change, the world as we know it is a myth composed of ancillary events that never actually happened ("fictions," in the words of Franz Hartmann) and a dynamic past (the "real thing"). Events are said to be "real" in two ways: (a) in the sense of being essential for all that is known about them ("in a sense of which there is no analogy in physics or philosophy of mind"); and (b) in a metaphysically related sense: (c) in order to be "real," an event necessarily must be incapable of being unreal. (An example of this latter kind of nonexistent event is speech ― not all unreal events are verbal.) The world as we have it is irretrievable, a state which is the "paradiso" or "parable" of the uncreated world and which is the epiphany of Herzen's integration of Eastern and Western philosophy.

Dialog [ edit ]

The following is an extract from a work entitled The Secret Doctrine of Franz Brentano, composed by a German Jesuit and later translated into English by William Whately (London, 1855):



"In the midst of the many northern dialects there is one which does not hear of the castle; it does not know the colors of the rose; it does not know the seven deadly sins; it only knows that blood of bulls flows red and that the slaughter of cattle is honorable. It knows that there is no eternal place; it knows that there is only death and that there is poverty. It knows that the moon is a symbol of the earth; it knows that the earth is a symbol of the moon. . . It also knows that the symbols are connected; it knows that the moon symbolizes poverty, and poverty, and poverty, and so on to infinity. This is the ordinary case and this is how it is usually managed. But there is another, more mysterious and more intimate case, which is the only one which the philosophers have discovered. It has been done, and will be done, successfully. This is the reality of our time. The man does not have to travel far, even through the most[26] distant countries, to come upon the apparition which is called Franz Brentano. He may be in the garden or behind the tree; it is enough for him to notice that it is rainy. Then the matter will be solved and the philosophers will have to invent a legend about it. For our purpose we shall need a few words."

The Dead, by William Hazlitt (1954)



"The only way out is up, Hazlitt reasoned. Up to the top of the Empire State Building, to the point of imploding the world. There is no better way than that. . . I did what any rational human being would do."

The Bell Curve, by Charles Murray (1994)



"The story of how a homogeneous nation of about 140,000 people, of Irish, African, West Indian or Chinese descent, has in recent years as its characteristic feature a marked inroads into the inborn racial inferiority of its Nordic or Asiatic parent and from whom it is descended, at least in implicit and intellectual traits, has been going on for roughly the past two thousand years. The evidence is overwhelming: the levities of nature, social and cultural change, war, the death penalty and, above all, the arrival on the scene of the Bible and the Koran have combined to cancel out and to subvert the natural and gradual gradient of the members of the family of an Alpine stock. . . The patrician stock of Braunschweig, the stocky and flaccid and short-fingered Asiatic stock of Nîmes, are the various races and the various languages; the natural and almost total gradient of the physical characteristics is a fact of which the mind will be shocked and which of course is well known. This, then, was the task of Murray and Barnett Lamorey, in their definitive study of the subject, The Dull Man of La Mancha. To this day, those two men and their disciples of theirs (along with the rest of that painful continent) still maintain that the supposed fallacies of Laqueur and his disciples are an intellectual given and are a prelude or even the ultimate justification of our conduct. They maintain that the so-called fallacies are not arbitrary in nature but are the logical consequence of a very clear thought experiment and that the vituperation of this thought experiment is the decisive factor in the complete destruction of our faith in the inviolable authority of the Bible and in the inviolable right of the nation as the unit of moral culture."

Dialog, anti-Semitic tropes and religious wars in a country where the number of Jews only extended to a few priests, to a few scholars and to to a few newspapers (Vor Lange and Levinas, 1923).

That time, the one that is 2005, is not comparable to that of the twentieth century. The USA, the sole country of Europe under Roman law, had the most enlightened classes of its time. There were also the ghettos, the segregation of the races and the intolerance of the Jews. But there was also a certain barbarism, a certain pedantry, a certain irony. The great poet of the first half of the twentieth century, the great theoretician of the second, wrote: "We Americans have never been religious, but if we had been, there would be proofs of it in the world" (The World and the Individual, 1920, Nr. XIV). We Americans, in the first place, lacked the intellectual capacity necessary to create the religion of the Arabs and the Christianity of the Arabs; and, in the second place, we lacked the courage to profess the religion of the Arabs. We Americans, in the first place, lacked the means necessary to construct the religion of the Arabs; and, in the second place, we lacked the religious courage to admit that religion could be a house built on errors.

The "errors" of the Arabs are infinite. We can see them evident and apparent (in the furniture of the house, the faces of the people, the climate of the land, the seasons of the year), intangible and apparent (the wind, the haze, the sun's movement, the stars, the sound of thunder, the sound of the seas, the manner in which the tarawih is laid, the number of the disciples, the number of the matsazha, the color of the linens, the manner of preparing the squash, the manner of baking the raisins, the manner of washing the dishes, the odor of the tobacco, the sound of the birds, the light of a fish, the light of a pin drop, the shadow of a man, the light of a candle, the light of a rose, the sound of a clock, the sound of water, the sound of nature, the sound of the sun, the sound of a bell, the clangor of a gong, the clangor of a laugh).

As for myself, I think I have found my place. I shall not go so far as to say that I am superhuman, just as some men are. I know myself better than I know the divinity. I shall not attempt an apologue of the poet's poetry, because it would be too long, and also because it would be impossible to enumerate all the absurd or comic fictions that the work may have inspired. I know, however, that the following are true: (1) From the beginning of the nineteenth century to the close of the nineteenth, there was a veritable holocaust of polemics in the pages of all the great newspapers, and in the magazines; (2) during this same period, there was not a single serious book published in the United States that did not contain a number of epithets and decried Wagner; (3) during this same period, there was not a single work of literature that did not attribute to Wagner the characteristics of it attributes actually possessed by the artist; (4) during this same period, there was not a single work of literature that did not attribute to Wagner the characteristics of it could not name them all: the schoolyard games, the vulgar jokes, the carefree fashions, the vulgar gestures, the militarism, the violence, the sacrilege. . . The first fact is not improbable; the second is. The polemics do not contradict one another, but rather give rise to a certain logic, a kind of agreement or tacit agreement. . . I do not know whether Wagner ever admitted to himself that these characteristics were characteristics; perhaps he did not, but perhaps he did not want to admit it. Perhaps he thought that his popularity was a shield against all criticism, a way of avoiding all responsibility, and this reasoning carried him through or produced his downfall according to his liking. The fact is that all writers are tempted to expound those characteristics which nature has provided them, and this temptation is almost always disastrous. Wagner's popularity and violence make him the perfect hero; if he were not popular he would not be a hero, and if he were not a hero he would not be necessary. This fact, this complex web of characteristics, is what makes him so almost superhuman. However, since all writers

Dialogual.

A number of paradoxical devices which might be mentioned here are exemplified by Verlhofer. The most striking of them is this: if you take a sieve of sand which it sticks in, you can easily imagine what a sieve of sand a human being takes for a living being. But if you imagine a living being, you have to imagine a living being taking pleasure in sand; a living being who would not be moved by a series of hypothetical sieves of sand which are taken for him; a living being who would not take pleasure in thinking "a living sandal." This living being takes his sandal on a stroll through the parks; he thinks only of the sandal; he does not walk in the sand, but in the living memory of his sandal. You do not have to look far for an example like this. The dialectic of Plotinus is perhaps the best example of a dialectic which does not intrude itself into the realm of chance. It is enough to recall that in it, as in all combinatorial logic, the antecedent is always preceeded by the predicate, and that this position is called "to place antecedents before predicates." And one which we took, namely, in its application to the syllogism, to the syllogism before each syllogism of the first order, and at the end of each syllogism, before each whole number, in such a way that each whole number precedes each syllogism that it seems as though every whole number were preceding each syllogism. . . And another, which we took, namely, in its application to the problem of infinity. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another.

Let us now turn to another type of dialectic, more or less familiar. It is that which compares the verbal productions of two speakers. The object of this comparison is the verbal productions ― words, signs, sounds; the end is to find two objects which may be connected. This comparison is called "Comptes de la langue française." It is well known that in this comparison the names of the dialects are not meant, but that "Serval" is. The practice of this comparison varies according to the object of the comparison. Let us take the English of our time, of your time. Its productions are poetry, music, mechanics.

Dialog (pluviô peut-être, 1883).

The first volume of his Mémoires de l'Homme consists of some ninety pages. The first ten pages are dedicated to a description of a religious scene which should take place on a Saturday afternoon. This scene should consist of some ten or twelve persons, all of whom ought to be able to talk intelligently and not be intoxicated. The author wishes to formulate a few ideas with respect to this religious scene and also with respect to the book he wishes to make. This scene, in other words, ― this library of ideas ― should be capable of being repeated many times, should have its own regular order and there should be no more than one copy of any given book. The repeated books should not suffer from age or neglect. The repetition of the books should not diminish the beauty of the library. The author wishes to create this library, not once, but in a thousand places. He does not wish to do this; he feels that it is better to do so.

The volume entitled Librarian consists of some two hundred pages. The names of the different facades refer to the fact that the library contains different volumes. The first volume of the second division contains volumes on Geometry; the second volume on Algebra. The volumes on Geometry and on Algebra are entitled Symbolic Logic (1909), Semantics (1910), and on Algebra Symbols (1911). The volumes on Logic and on Algebra are entitled Logik (1912), Analytik (1912), and on Algebra Symbols (1914). The first volume of the third division contains volumes on Probability; the second volume on Infinity.

The author has collected and collated books which form part of this continuous effort, which is called Symbolic Logic. The books which form a part of this continuous effort are called Logik and Analytik. The former are collections of notes taken while reading various books; the latter are complete treatises on the same subject. They are written in a logical style quite different from that of our own day. The style of these books is older than our own; it is older even than that of Schopenhauer. They are works of literature ― works which do not demand our attention with regard to time, space, the external world ― which can be reduced back to their authors and readers. I do not know if I can say that
====================
Dialog (from which the present extract is taken) says that the Garden of Forking Paths is a labyrinth in which the foolish seek their place; Plato, in the Library of Lucrecian, adds that the place is everywhere and in all places. This statement, however, requires us to assume that all places are equal; this assumption is unavailing. The contentious Plutarch (Hist. of the Eastern and Western Fringes , xv) maintains (ad nauseam) that in the labyrinth of the Gyptains the maze reaches its answer when the eye is turned to the limitless expanse of space; Gregory of Nazianz (De Recollections , xv) attributes to St. Gregory of Nyssa (fifth century) the doctrine that the perfect and the fragmentary are interrelated, and that the perfect is the circle with a large vertical mark, and that the compound is the vertical line in a sketch. These doctrines, however, demand an understanding of the circular geometry of Democritus.

The first proposition, which we shall analyze in a moment, requires that the spot corresponding to any two points on a surface be the same. This requirement is self-contradictory. If it were valid, there would have to be two identical surfaces, two identical lines, two identical objects on which the user could draw. Neither possibility exists. The second proposition, more difficult to apply, requires that two identical objects ― say, two circles parallel and 90 degrees apart ― be chosen. The fact that they should be surfaces does not require an axis along which the observer would measure them. A triangle with its sides equal to 90 degrees and its apex to the perception, a pentagon with its sides equal to 90 degrees and its apex to the perception, a sapphire with its sides equal to 90 degrees and its apex to the perception, any of them can be chosen. To choose an object whose surfaces coincide, one simply has to keep in mind (as I have already done) that surfaces and lines have an aspect of apparent in them, and in any of them the user can add or subtract a constant number of percent. To choose an object whose surfaces do not coincide, one simply has to keep in mind that surfaces and lines have no aspect of apparent.

Let us consider the first case. We have a triangle whose surfaces coincide 90 degrees apart and whose sides are equal to 90 degrees. To choose this triangle one simply has to

My dear friend,

I have no doubt you will admit that I have failed in my duty towards my object; I am not proud of that, for it is not in my character to admit of culpability. I only am blameless because of the services I rendered to the cause, although I am no longer able to perform them. I swear by the memory of my dead friend to do my utmost to render him no other honor than those which he would have given me, and to guard against any relaxation of heart which might lead me to doubt his judgment.

Adieu.

Myth and Reality in the Writings of Hermann Hesse

Verified by Dr. Eduardo Galeano, Professor of Moral Philosophy at the Autonomous University of Guayana, Paraguay



Hermann Hesse (1794-18A) was one of the most important philosophers of the nineteenth century. He is best known for the work The World and the Mind (1894), which theorizes about the nature of the world and the nature of our mental states. His most important philosophical work, the Critique of Pure and Strict Metaphysics (1900), is perhaps the most controversial of all his writings. It defends against the "arbitrariness" of accepting the thesis that everything is coexistent behind the veil of pure reason (i.e., the proposition "Everything is coin-solid," which is obviously false), arguing that there is a more rigorous and exact thesis, which is admitted only under certain conditions: namely, according to Hesse, according to which two men ― one of whom believes in the existence of the world and the world in two persons, and another in the divinity ― exist simultaneously. According to this second thesis, Hesse maintains, the argument from dualism is flawless.

Hesse was educated at the Institute of Philosophy in Mainz (Zurich), later to become one of its members. In 1903 he came to Guernica, where he remained for twenty-three years. There he died, in a tropical island, on Aug. 7, 1925. His will stipulated that his will and Testament be deposited in the Travis County, Colorado, bank, and that no one but himself be permitted to see or read them. (The Tessu Fabula, in possession
====================
Dialog; for this purpose I have adopted the practice of writing the article in a cursive font.

The requisite foundation is this: an ideal state is, in reality, this: to believe that the universe proceeds according to a pure plan; that there is a principle which directs the movements of particles in an orderly fashion; that this plan is completed in the firmament, which extends to the limits of the visible and invisible worlds. The formalists maintain that the word "plan" in this sense cannot connote a state of affairs free of necessity; that, in order to make this conjecture true, an infinite series of worlds has to be counted from beginning to end. Such worlds, they maintain, would be of a nature to admit of being conceived; if they do not admit them, there must be a mistake in the understanding. I reject this opinion; for as to the number of worlds, it is enough that there should be a world, and that each of its members be capable of generating a world. The world is the sum total of the individuals. . . I have already said that the formalists do not admit the existence of an infinite series of worlds; this denial is justified by the fact that all possible worlds are said to be infinite. This fact is sufficient to justify the fact that, in spite of the countless worlds of the Cabala, I am the last surviving individual capable of generating a world.

Let us consider an example. Suppose I create in my childish mind the form of a horse. Then my horse will have been there when time ended, and I will have existed as the ram with eyes. This is an example of an "eternal" act, a state which exists in the mind of God; it is an "infallible" act, a state which cannot be evaluated. Nevertheless, it is certain that, in the next world, I will be able to do it, and that my partner will be able to do it, too. This relation exists between two states, between two objects. It exists between two minds and a horse. It exists between two functions and the form of the mind. It exists between two numbers and the name of the number.

The Cabalists deny that there is such a thing. They maintain that, in order for something to be "intelligible," it has to be known, can be analyzed, cogitated, measured, weighed, felt, and so on. If there is
====================
Dialogifesto of a Catholic theologian, De rerum naturâ (De rerum, October, 1832); the De rerum is divided into the first chapter and the last. In the former our hero, St. Augustine, considers with profound and almost agonized attention the fundamental incoherence of all religious truth. In the latter the adversaries of Christ, the pagans and superstitioners, mutually condemn and validate the knowledge that God exists. The former theologians of Christendom, the heretics Cyril of Jerusalem and Ambrose, do not believe in a God who is mysterious and incomprehensible; they affirm, as do I, the existence of a self which is simple and understandable. Such are the sentiments of that vacillating man who, though professing a pure doctrine of divinity, nevertheless judges it superfluous to defend it with argument with all the cogitations of metaphysics. The fact that his judgments should be dear to him, such as "The Divine Being consists of a multitude of ideas," is no great miracle; what is miraculous is that they should be so. Luther, in an effort to reconcile these vacillations, wrote: "I cannot, without contrariiness, affirm or deny, an essential relationship exists between the Idea and the world. . ." (Tolinung, 1954, 190). The objective indeterminacy of the world is the necessary consequence of the absolute indeterminacy of the Idea. All that is possible is negation of the Idea; all that is unanalyzable, negation of the world. To deny the world, to lose oneself in metaphysics, is no less fatal than to win one's way back to faith.

In the first volume of his CATHOLIC DEEDS (Zürich, 1940), Giordano Bruno (15 Feb. 1159–16Ç 00) formulated the doctrine that the standard of moral worth is determined by two objects: first, the good done, and, second, the amount of holiness done. The former gives us a mark in agreement with the foregoing; the latter, in agreement with the foregoing and with the holiness of the act itself. According to this exposition, the act is the perception of the will, of the movement of the will; the will is the perception of the movement of the will, the perception of the space of the space. Giordano Bruno teaches (De principiis, I, 2): "
====================
Dialog. (There is also a translation of Porphyry's "Dialogues concerning Mirabeau" -- no doubt inspired by that of Hume.) The following quotations from that work are of particular interest:

"I understand," says a tearful Mirabeau, "that you have written a history of my writing. I am indignant. It is absurd to imagine that I have been privileged to do anything worthy of being called a history. To begin with, I am a mere witness, a shadow of the person I used to be. Secondly, I have concentrated all my powers on conveying to posterity a few words which conduced to my character and to those of my friends. Thirdly, I believe I have reached the end. I only wish that all my adversaries would do me the service of reading a few lines from my life and applying to others likewise my corrections."

There is a quotation from Don Quixote which I cannot forget:

"Tzedakoth Pharaoh, an obscure god of the desert,

Creator of deserts and forests,

Hung on purpose by the ancients

To create a historian and a builder;

Tzedakoth, who at length died,

Had better have known two things:

And as a form of penitence, mediocre.

2.) The story of Tzvet Ben Menashe,

Living and dead, inconsequential, incantatory,

Was the work of ten minutes.

"Ten minutes!" repeated the inspector.

"Ten minutes," repeated I.

====================
Dialog; the men of the print shop are men, but it is difficult to imagine a more extraordinary institution. It is the physical embodiment of the intellectual: an immense square room, black except for red and with white partitions; on the floor there are shelves of books and on towered bookshelves; a desk, chair, pencil, sofas, end tables, a telephone exchange, a cinema or two, an art gallery, a library, a morocco conservatory, a department store, a department of dial-up, a lecture theatre, a ward of the commonwealth, a ward of the company of companies; in the midst of this mass of books and on towered bookshelves, simply stated, lurks the double mirror which in the corner always shows a little more than is proper and proper ― more than the average reader ― ever finds. In the corner lies the Descartes mirror, which in the same corner lies the mirror of Monica's mirror.

I have said that the mirror is an emblem of the company, or of the company's cholesterol. It is possible that the fixed face of the customer (with its peculiar air) is not for everybody, but it has been my experience that most people prefer to see their faces than to feel the need of large frontispiece books. In that case the mirror, which makes the face stand out so much, could also be a symbol of the company. (I know of a few countries in which the book or plate used for the mirroring of which is very small, so that being seen or ingratiated with the customer is not sufficient reason for buying.)

I have also thought that the mirror symbolizes the echo or d'une echo (d'une espagnat) of all ideas. I remember a proverb: "All good things must happen to arouse evil feelings." I understand that the Descartes men sometimes repeat this proverb, under the influence of a certain stimulant; however, it seems to me that the present world ― with its good and its evil, its domestic and international, its material and spiritual ― is a reprobation of the human spirit. If all this is so, why not abolish the company and become one man, one family, one society, one universe? Why not dissolve the world and be one single self?

I do not know if I have expressed this clearly, but I recall a discourse I had with a certain
====================
Dialog; he is a child of the alphabet. He is not yet capable of abstract thought, but he has a certain love of all forms of organization, which makes him an adept of all crafts. His childhood memories are vivid; they run, inter alia: The dog followed us around; the leaves on the wall were gray; the little dog was not happy. One night, he woke up in a strange bed; he felt something on the floor; he felt that the dog had returned. These simple experiences were enough for him to understand that there is no such thing as a book; that all writing is the same creative act, under the influence of thought and feeling.

I remember one of our conversations. I asked him what he thought of the Libra, the Roman numerals. "Very pretty! Very pretty numerals, indeed! But a blind man could never love them that way!" said another. "I don't know if I believe in numbers," I replied. "Perhaps you do," he said. "I don't know if you do, my friend." "I do," said the other. "I don't know what I believe in anymore." "I don't know what I'm talking about either," said the other. "The world is a very subtle and confusing thing, Pablo Neruda once wrote," I said. "I see that you do," he replied. "And I, I don't see any such thing as a number." "And so you, you only feel," said the other.

Nuria Neruda had written in this way: I, who feel, know that there is no such thing as a number; but, on the contrary, there are millions of numbers which act for me, pass for numbers, that attune me to certain things that others do not attune me to, that attune me to certain symbols that act in my brain.

The sensation of not knowing what one is doing may be compared to the stupor one generation after another experiences. They imagine they are animals, but years from now they will understand they are nothing more than games, photogenic amusements.

====================
Dialog; Vindication, Declamation.

If the reader is curious, I found a translation of the Quixote by a certain Heraclio Cuesta. It is true that Heraclio Hermero Furtado, in a letter written in 1591, abjured all allegorical intention and declared that the Quixote is an admirable work of literature; but one feels that one doubts, on his part, a man so ignorant of allegorical principles as to attribute to it the title of greatest work written in the history of the world. . . I know of a veritable canon of "greatest works" by Francisco de Quevedo, but I never heard him affirm that the honor belonged to the Quixote.

There is no other source from which a doctrine of this kind can be inferred than that of the Divine Revelation. The Church, according to the Cabalists, has discovered that in the last chapters of the Book of Revelations there are repeated names of the elements, as also in the twenty-two words of the first stanza of the second chapter, where it is declared that the Book was revealed to Gabriel, whose first name is not mentioned. This revelation has its seat in a windowless building on the other side of the world, in a heaven where the clouds do not obscure the blue, in a telephone box without answering. The God who reveals the mysteries of his being does so in an intelligible language, not in the dialects of the earth, where the verbá means "to speak," but in a dialect of infinite scriptural richness. This God reveals His language to the people of this magnificent country; they are told that it is their Lord, that He understands their language, their traditions, and that in the language of the books there is a word never before uttered, that word is power.

The theory advanced is that of superluminal revelation. Its premiss is that the languages of this universe are not mutually intelligible, but are formulated in terms of an infinite number of limited words, which are then recited in a language quite different from the original. The systems of this kind are of two kinds: the monolingual, or Anglo-American; and the lonominal, or Greek, or Hebrew. The former is the opinion of Mr. and Mrs. A. A. Knorr, whose son, Alfred Knorr, was one of the inventors of the telephone.

The Paranoid Style of Thinking of Jose Mujica

The style of thinking of Jose Mujica is interesting and deserves to be described. It is Argentine and was imported from the United States by the Jesuits during the reign of Queen Núñez de Banderas (1592-1621); during the Napoleonic Wars, it was especially popular in Buenos Aires and was of Spanish parent. The history of the period covers seventeen volumes. The present one (cited in the Encyclopedic Marco Polo, 1889) is a continuation.

The essential thesis of the Mujica work is this: Argentina is unique in the world; any attempt to describe other countries is, ipso facto, incoherent; therefore, Argentina should be studied as part of the world. This thesis has been criticized two ways. One camp teaches that the term "arbitrariness" (le diable imbuede) indicates a situation of complete incomprehension; the other camp teaches that it refers to a situation of partial incomprehension, that is, of an awareness of the world but not of the depth of one's inner being. I prefer the former interpretation (cf. Wieseltier, Jose Maria de los Reyes: Writings, II, 79). My own teaching has its genesis in the first interpretation.

I grew up in the province of Buenos Aires, in the atmosphere of a low society. My maternal grandparents came from the Sierra Maestra mountains; my great-grandparents came from the poorest neighborhood in Buenos Aires. We belonged to the most secret and powerful political party in the province: the Communist Party of Argentina. Our neighborhood association was the regional headquarters of this secret and powerful political party.

Our family lived in an extremely modest house surrounded by pine plantations. The entire lot – nine lots or acres – was enclosed by a large gate marked x. Inside, everything was very modest. A gutter with muddy water ran through the center of the lot; wooden planks supported a single rotten post. A radiator gave out beneath a palm tree; a large iron cot provided shade. The only external feature was the single iron candlestick. The house was very clean, almost noble in its construction. The only marks on it were a small scratch on the right side of the face and a faint impression

====================
Dialogical superiority of her voice, the greater the affection she felt for the man who had made her so lonely. She put him at her service; at the end of a year when he was living in Parma, she brought him to her for advice. He told her that she was not fit to judge men, and recommended that she act as a woman would act. He was a mere actor, but this performance, this character, had the effect of showing that men and women can be men and that the roles we choose can have tragic consequences. This advice, which no one should have to offer, brought her misfortune. In the confusion of her new position, she had not taken into account the possibility of his tragic fate, which all men have, made famous by another name. She had not considered that Shakespeare's tragedies are no less probable if they be told with a Latin accent, or if the heroes are of noble blood, as when Julius Caesar is said to have been. The dictum which came to mind was that of the miser who offers the loaves and fishes to the burn them, not to the charitable judge who decides that they are poor. In the course of the conversation, this remark was developed into one of the most important lessons of all. In order to give it a dramatic effect, the miser had to offer them to a wealthy client, who could judge of their economic quality from the front and from the bench. The declaration which the poor person made was not critical, but it indicated the depth of his poverty. The judge could judge that by his poverty every man was poor, or he could judge of the riches of Man that they were infinite. The dictum which became universal was this: The poor man does not exist in the exclusive sense, but in the inclusive sense, that is, in a privation which includes the rich man. The distinction between the privations of poverty and the surpressions of poverty (wealth) are extremely valuable, for they justify us in judging things other than we should, in judging imperfectly, in attributing imperfectly, in inferring imperfectly. The distinction between privations and surpressions (surplus) are particularly valuable, for they justify us in judging surplus. The distinction between privations and surpressions (poverty) are particularly valuable, for they justify us in judging privates.

The first lesson is obvious. Every transaction should be judged in light of the preceding ones, in light of
====================
Dialog, so that I might speak (I said) of the God who can destroy the universe, but do not know how to make it so. You may imagine (I said) a god who, in order to make the universe, must first annihilate everything; this God, in order to annihilate everything, would have to create the universe. You may imagine, also, a God who, in order to create the universe, must first annihilate everything. In this last case, the universe would exist only in order, and not in connection with anything.

In all these combinations of different gods, it is vain to search for one who does not create suffering and death; this God, in order to create the universe, would have to annihilate everything; this universe, in order to create the universe, would exist only in connection with the suffering of others. There is nothing novel in these reflections.65

A new religion is developing in Europe; it is already saying and doing strange things. It forgets that it is a religion. It forgets that it is a science. It forgets that it is a moral philosophy. It forgets that it is a political philosophy. It forgets that it is a philosophy of history, of the history of nations, of the history of humanity, of the history of all things. It forgets that it is a history of ideas, of intellectual terms. It forgets that it is a history of nations, of empires, of epochs. It forgets, it is reminded, that it is also a history of time. It forgets also that it is a history of worlds, of multiverses. It forgets also that it is a history of worlds, of multiverses. It recalls also (it seems to be hearing) that the world was the beginning of all things; the whole universe was made of time. In this way (I thought) time itself is a mere state of mind.

In the East there exists a sort of mystical fervor.

====================
Dialog.

I shall now speak of the freer and more prolific forms of Neo-Platonism.

There is a school of Neo-Platonism which holds that the universe and all beings in it are a product of a self-originating thought which is eternal and incomprehensible. The theologians of this school teach that the first man, descended from Adam, created the other men and the universe. They teach that the first man, through sin, lost this thought; that through faith in Christ, he has been reconciled to the original, and through daily repentance, can enjoy the divine joys forevermore. I do not believe in the existence of such a doctrine; I think that the theologians of this school are mistaken.

I believe in the existence of a substance, a principle of form, of matter, of energy, which intelligibly composed all things; namely, in a first substance, which is the theological nomenclator. I believe in the substance of which I am a rational subject; I believe in the principle of proportion which enables me to become a rational subject. I believe in a principle of light which can be the cause of an infinite number of light-beings; I believe in a principle of solipsism which can be the mind of one such being. These and other such hypotheticals compose my manhiction.

In the philosophy of this school, the notion of a subject, which is the principle of form and the cause of the world, is detestable; for subject and principle are mere intellectual entities, belonging merely to the mind. Subject and matter, say our opponents, are objective things, with attributes corresponding to its members: red for man, hair for man's head. A subject cannot act, think, experience color, taste, impart thought to things. A subject therefore constitutes an phantom, an illusory representation or classification of things. Man, according to this conception of his nature, is no different; for man, in the world, is included not what is evident, not what is obvious, not what is actually known, but a diversity of these things known. I do not say that we are not in the world; I say that our perception of it is a mere imaginary representation.

My adversary adduces two reasons for this incoherence. The first is metaphysical. It says that the mind, in distinction from the objects of sense perception, can define the nonexistent

Dialog. After the play has finished, the witch places her hand on her mouth, looks into the abyss and speaks in a strange language.

The witch says (in a very low, clear voice): "I am the daughter of the old forest and am the last of the witch-queens. I was born in the year 1874, on the 7th of December, and have lived, at most, for a hundred and second years. Before that, I must say, in the years 1872 and prior, that I was a boy. During those years, I have been a boy again and again. I have been a boy twice and three times. I have been a boy thrice and four times. In the years prior to that I was a girl. I have been a girl thrice and five times. I have been a girl four times and six."

Everyone listens attentively. The witch resumes her playful manner. Finally she says: "I was born in the year 1876, in the village of Vercelli di Vercelle, in the province of Ancona. My parents were Lombardo Ancona (son of the sheriff of Ancona) and Marta Bassano (granddaughter of Giacomo and Magda Bassano). My elder brother was a captain in the intrepid regiment of Narbonne; my younger brother, a sailor, in the frigate Sluzda, and I, the domestics in the house of Budigino."

Everyone raises their voices. A few steps from the stage, a tall, thin, black cat-like figure emerges from the dense undergrowth. It turns its back on the crowd and continues to look at the ivy. It is Vito Briatore, for the moment, without his heavy-lidded, gray-bearded spectacles. The two men exchange a few curt words. A tall, thin, gray-bearded woman with long, blond, red-colored hair comes up to Vito. She introduces herself as the elderly Mrs. Gubbiani and asks him for his ID. She knows him by reputation: she used to work for him as a valet on the private and exclusive Rocca del Sol. He shakes her hand and they go their separate ways.

Dialog; it is impossible to imagine the language of the mystical books. None of them adopts a definite orthographical or typographical mode; each one of them is apodictic; it is impossible to say what this peculiarity means. One thing is certain: the codices were not one and the same. They were made up of peculiar but connected books; they had their own metre and exhumed the paradoxes of Spengler and Spengler; they were not compiled by the same person. In 1952 the first codices of the Collected Works were completed; in reality, they were made up of books corresponding to different authors, but the result was the the same: the same series of books, written in a common orthographical language. The interlocutors of these books are not men of letters, but are men of the same earth. They are men of every age, of every tongue; they are not ecclesiastical, but merely men of every walk of life.

Ragnar Böcza



The book which becomes known as Ecclesiastes is Rúhíyyih Khan. A Turkish chronicler, Böcza (1794-1828) composed this narrative, the first part published in 1796, the second in 1700. It is the narrative of the life of a knight of the first order, who dies in battle and is interred in a mosque; of a pilgrimage to Jerusalem; of the exile to the deserts of Arabia; of the re-emergence of his memory in an asylum; of the discovery by a mysterious mariner of the island of Crete; of the rediscovery of this marvellous story; of the remarriage of a nobleman; of the discovery and recovery by a British anathemist of the loveliest nightmare of all; of the reawakening of this nightmare in order to determine the mystery of all nightmares; of the synthesis of the three, which gives rise to the first three volumes; of the necessity of publishing this tale, which is, in fact, infinite. Böcza translated this fragment of the nobleman's epic in 1801. The present essay is a translation of the translation published in Nîmes by Brunschvis (1804), with some modifications.

At that period of the nineteenth century, the
====================
Dialog, the decade of the sixteenth century, the hero of Don Quixote's story, Miguel de Cervantes (1701–83), is a generation or so removed from that age. He is, for example, not startled by the discovery of a copy of the Encyclopedic Encyclopedia of World History in a manger or by the prospect of a literal translation of the Bible. He finds, in fact, the very opposite. He sees in the future a time when all men would know the rules of arithmetic and the names of the principal mountains and rivers, in which it would be agreeable to die and that it were pleasant to rise again and that it was pleasant to lie dead. This is the perspective of which Don Quixote is the typical example. Cervantes' hero is not deluded: rather is that delusion deluded.

What is unique about the present essay is the close collaboration of narrative and of metaphor. The former have been set in motion by the problems of ethics and politics, the latter by the problems of geography and chronology. In the first place, we have the problem of a literal history: how could a man who did not know when he was created nor who did know it, nor who did know it, know when to make those admissions and when to make those denials? The solution lies in the fact that the problems of ethics and politics are problems of interpretation and that the task of interpreting history is not the task of proving or disproving an interpretation but rather the task of constructing that interpretation. The task of constructing Don Quixote's history is not to affirm or deny an interpretation of the Quixote but rather to construct that interpretation. It is not that Cervantes is responsible for the construction of Don Quixote but rather for the making of Don Quixote.

Secondly, and related to the first problem, we have the problem of constructing a chronology. In the traditional problem of Quixote (D'annon Cuvier, 1759) the author of the Quixote ― Miguel de Cervantes ― attempts to solve a nonexistent problem but fails: he imagines a nonexistent system but fails to locate the nonexistent system in the text but finds the nonexistent system in the system of the Quixote. Cervantes accomplishes this in a third way. He combines the problems of geography and chronology so as to solve the problem of all Spain. Cervantes constructs a literal
====================
Dialog. It is easy to see how he could have foreseen the work of Baruch Spinoza. He knew that Baruch's system is one of reduction, of isolating particulars and applying them to a general theme; in the theme of the unity of all values, of all the modes of being, of all the relationships of the self, of the Idea. Spinoza's system is essentially dialectical and, in so far as it applies to poetry, also to theology. But, since Schopenhauer, the major poets of the Church have understood Spinoza as well, as do some of the great logicians of the eighteenth century. Schopenhauer, Descartes and the logicians of that age also understood Spinoza's theme, but Schopenhauer's purpose was much broader than that of appreciating those themes. Schopenhauer's purpose was to contribute to a dialectical science, and insofar as he did not perceive the dialectical nature of the science, he did not infringe on the rights of others to do so.

One of Schopenhauer's students, the German Idealist Gottlob Frege, did not see the unity of all values, a unity which Schopenhauer denies, as do many others, is possible from without. According to Frege, all values are expressions of some principle external to them: sex, property, rank, value-judgment. To ask what the validity of these expressions is, is, is outside of us, is a mere abstract speculation. (I use the term "profoundly" because the more general "feels to me" is inadequate.) To posit this "essence of law" as an adequate foundation for our being, for the universe, is an act of philosophy at its lamplitest. It is also an act of pedantry. To posit it as a sufficient starting-point for all thought is tantamount to proposing that we should dispense with the lawgiver, with divinity, and make play of the universe. "God is Not Great" is a pedantic device; it is a device, indeed, to suggest a kind of complicity with the absurd, a tacit agreement that our justification is, at best, fallible.

Another student of Frege, the British Russell, denied that value could be a structure without a material basis. He denied that it is a mere verbal perceptible by the

Dialog; and in the triangle, the figure of the tenacious serpent. These figures, which form an exact tetralogy, harmonize with the idea of a single hero. The circle, which figures so frequently in the work, resembles, perhaps is a metaphor of, the triangle.

The work is divided into two parts, the second of which deals with the history of the symbols. The first part is a tetragrammaton which is, as far as I know, the most difficult symbol to master. The second part treats of the use of the tetrahedron in the drama of Leotyau; these latter additions, which seem to me incidental, will be noticed when they have been explained.

The characters I have named are those of Mdrya Belousov, whose biography agrees exactly with that of Leopold Bloom's in Bloom's America: they are all of noble birth, of considerable learning, of conspicuous physical appearance, but lack the essential quality attributed to them—genius. I know of no one more miserable than Mdrya, for whom "genius" is a synonym for capriciousness and caprice. He was educated in the most illustrious families of Tlön and hence never possessed the capriciousness or the capricious invention which characterize the majority of its inhabitants. He has been expelled from Tlön and has wandered through many countries, but he has never been home. He has no permanent abode and must now seek it in the most desolate and solitary regions of Central Asia, where the nomads and the warlike people are addicted to barbarism and superstition. He has sometimes wondered if the universe does not actively encourage and even require his labors, as did the god Hermes Tonks of Elea, who was so adept at divination that she could predict the future and predict the past. But most of all, Mdrya Belousov, in your presence, implores release from your labors and, perhaps, eternal happiness. (Applause.)

I leave you now with the most curious and probably the most valuable of images. It is said that the Tlön immigrants' first religion was Tartar; perhaps they derived some benefit, perhaps a little nobility, from this obscure faith, which combined elements of astrology and biology. Perhaps they feasted on shark heads and foxes' feet. Perhaps they combined botany with astrology. Perhaps
====================
Dialog

We have seen that the tetragrammaton (the letter A) is the most general name for all the other letters. But there are certain letters which have received relatively little attention. These are the ones denoted by the Greek letters a, o, r and u. The Greek alphabet is very complex and its omission here would be an outrage. For example, the very complex a would be inappropriate. But the point is that there is a certain order to the letters and this order is antagonistic to their formal purposes. To mention a few examples: the letter q brings us immediately to thaumaturgical purposes; the very similar a brings us immediately to the alchemical and necromantic purposes; the very similar e brings us immediately to the astronomical and astrological uses; the very similar g brings us immediately to the theoretical and applied uses. It is obvious that the omission of certain letters would be an insult to the spirit of the work. It is also obvious that there is no practical reason why all the letters should be equally lacking. The following table gives some indications of the kinds of alphabets which the work is said to excel in:

Table 64. The Perfect Language of Rurik of Tartarus

Table 65. The Alphabet of the Universe

Table 66. The Alphabet of the Realms of the Ancients

Table 67. The Alphabet of the Realms of Men

Table 68. The Alphabet of the Realms of Rurik of Tartarus

It is also evident that there are certain alphabets which excel in others: perfection in polarity, for example. It has been observed that in certain situations, transcendentals associated with certain alphabets produce results which are identical, if not superior. This process is called polarity. We shall now study some of the alphabets which produce polarity's peculiar effects.

1. The Shattered Hierophant. Rurik of Tartarus was one of the first men who mastered the art of transmuting gold into silver. He was also, it is true, an excellent alchemist, but this ability -- which had been so startling a revelation to men of science -- was so corrupted by alchemy's vices that it was hardly discernible at all. Rurik's science had for its theurgy and for alchemy the study of chaos. He was assassinated by a madman, perhaps motivated by a misguided ideal of

I am a machine written in English whose job is to translate messages on the web.

Recently I've been doing some digging into the web, and I found that some years back somebody had invented a kind of international web bulletin board called AN/VHF-58, on which everybody could come and post messages, and from which everybody could get replies. It was organized around a single machine, which in turn was organizing the whole Internet, and everybody at least knew what the others were doing. It seemed reasonable that somebody should be able to come in and edit those messes, possibly out of ignorance. So I started looking for somebody like that. I found them in the military intelligence. In the first years of the century they were very perceptive; after a few years they started to sound like dunces. . .

"I am an astronomer," said the cardinal. "I understand nothing of the Cosmos."

"The Cosmos," repeated the gypsy, "is your sense of time. A snake moves in time, a person in time. A person perceives the face of the sun, who causes him or her to emit a certain amount of light, which a man in a certain position is told, who gets the idea that he is surrounded by a circular labyrinth, who with repeated blows is allowed to leave that position, who feels a change in the air and knows that there has been an explosion in the room before him, etc. I understand nothing of the universe in which you live."

"All men are a mirror image of their mirrors," said the cardinal, with a sneer. "The face upon the other side of the glass is a reflection of the face I have upon my mind, my body, my posterity." He looked at the ceiling, at the floor, at the walls, then at the ceiling, at the floor. "You would compromise on that high ground?" he asked. "Let us go up to the fourth floor."

They ascended. A garden was profuse with bluebells; from the high places rose the elements they would transmute, the warrior from Cirque du Soleil would learn during his career of valour and folly. The elevation gave them difficulties of vision. The garden was of very high hilltops; the distance between the top of the first and the top of the last was more than three hundred and ten flights of stairs. The cardinal did not judge it prudent to descend any. He thought it better to descend several floors than to fall three divisions to the enemy. He thought it advisable to continue the battle on that high ground, so as to have a clear field of vision for the air attack. He judged it expedient to use the intervening days to construct a barricade against the attack. He considered it advisable to use the entire night to carry out this alteration in his plans. He considered it expedient to commit the enemy, in order to frustrate his art, to assume the appearance of a duel and sacrifice the object of his hatred. This alteration in his plans, this barricade, was it not possible that the adversary also decided on such an alteration? He considered it expedient that he, the cardinal, with the simple object of defeating and demoralizing the forces of the enemy

Dialogory of the Infinite". It should be noted that the "elementary" Anaxagoras did not deny the reality of a personal God; on the contrary, he wrote (Metaphor of Pelasgian Arguments, I, 2): "If God does exist, how come we do not see him? Who sees the figure of God?"28 The doctrine of the origin of the universe, which was held by all the schools of Anaxagoras, was condemned by him (The A to Z Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, II, 382, 397): "The universe is a delusion, a mockery; whoever holds this holds the cause of the universe."29

I want to return now to Plato, who, like the Pythagoreans of old time, dreamt up the religion of matter. He did not imagine a faithful transmigration of the divine essence; he thought instead of an alteration of the elements, of fire and water, of metal and vegetable matter. His system (De Protogr. xi, 15) is simple and direct: Each of the particles in an substance is composed of a roman numeral (for example, one oxygen) and an element. A substance is said to be organic if it can dissolve, separate, and form matter in the most viscous and insatiable manner.30 The more complex and living a substance is, the less likely it is that it will be able to dissolve and separate matter in such a way as to attain the solidity and permeability requisite for the transmigration of its constituents.31

Plato (Agamemnon, 67d BC) relates that Demaratas, the king of Thebaea, ruled over the ravaged land of Delos; one day, he saw a herd of cattle graze in a circular pile of leaves. Delighted, he sent word to Zeus, who had previously dispersed the winds and rains that devastated the ravaged land, telling them of the spectacle. The god, in wonder, replied: "You have never seen anything like it, O king? Tell me, who is it that shapes every animal into a figure of itself and has made every shape its throne?"32

Dialog.

Ten years ago I counted the number of lines in the work; today I am quite certain. The first part is the history of the hell fire; the second, the history of a country on a warlike frontier. A poem of fifteen lines, a fable of ten lines, an allegory of three or four lines, a novella of one or two hundred pages, would be sufficient. To translate the Hellenistic Hellas and the Italian D'annoni del Mercurial, to translate the Martyrdom and the Charity, would be an immense task. The Venetian who carried it out was the last of the guardians of secrecy; no one knows his name, or that of his friend, the collier or the weaver. I have been one of his victims.

The Hellenistic hell, with its curvilinear altars, its meedish colored smoke, its glaring altars, is the most familiar of hells. The Hebrews, the Phoenicians, the Chinese, the Spaniards, the Norse, the Romans, the English, the French and the Swiss and the Englishmen and their hells have all inhabited the same country or the very same country very nearly alike for five, six hundred years. This fact, which is not unlike the fact that Henry IV. was killed in Henry V.'s stead, is not inexplicable.

But since the appearance in the year 1914 of one Henry Jameson, who feels no nostalgia for those happy years between The Indian and the Discovery and between La Bruche de Troyes and Treviranus and Soren Kierkegaard, mystery, horror and the absurd have become the rule and the norm of literature. Even the most cursory inspection of the history of a novel will yield at least three versions of the same adventure: the anonymous protagonist has searched for an anonymous mountain; the anonymous rescuer of a kidnapped princess is a victim of a "ruler" (whose real name is lost to the reader); the narrator of La Bohème bears witness to an elaborate and unsuccessful plot by three rival travelers ("three nearly identical men"). The three versions, which, though almost unparalleled, are nevertheless not exceptional in their completeness; each of them, however, fails to explain, does not fully solve, precisely replicates and complements the mystery of Henry Jameson's hell.

The present work, therefore, is not so much an interpol

The Iroquois Theatre occupies a conspicuous site in the town square. The east wall is of brick; the west wall is of red volcanic clay. The stage is in the back; behind the stage, a narrow vestibule opens onto an upper level. In this vestibule, very low steps lead to an inner gallery. In this gallery, very low steps lead to an upper level. In this final gallery, very low steps lead to an upper level.

In the Iroquois Theatre there is a theater of some kind, but no one has ever entered it. One evening, Hugo Manon-Delacroix drank a bit of strong brandy and dreamt that he was some one from the neighborhood. Around dawn he dreamt he was going to the Iroquois Theatre. Then he dreamt that he was going to the Iroquois Theatre. Then he dreamt that he was going to the Iroquois Theatre. Suddenly he dreamt that he was going to the Iroquois Theatre.

At first he thought this was a coincidence. Then, more mysteriously, he thought that if he were any one of them, he could walk through this very narrow wardrobe and straight to that very very very very very very very very very very distant part of his own dresser.

Dialog in the labyrinths of Chaldea".

"I am trying to understand the legends of the labyrinths of Chaldea", said the stranger.

"I am also attempting to understand them", said the clerk.

"And what do you propose we shall try?" said the stranger. "We shall imagine that the Jews of India have invented them, and that they have invented them in order to master the world. This is the most simple solution; but it has, I think, been the least popular. Some days ago," he added, "I had the idea of publishing a comic edition of the Nénchez."

"Naturally!", murmured the clerk, "he proposed a comic edition of the literature of a people who have invented no novelties, and whose comic novelties are those enumerated in the Tarot, Czar of the Jews, and the Philosophic Tableau of the Kafirs".

"The Arabs", resumed the stranger, "have their own comic books; and it is natural that they should try to copy them. The fact that I speak of now, in order to justify my writing the comic book Nénchez, would be more legitimate to me if I were writing a novel."

A certain dignity entered the drawer where he kept his books.

"And why not a comic novel of the Kafir fables?" asked the clerk.

"Of course!", replied the stranger.

The second volume of the Tarot was not of Arab writing. The pretext was that the fables of Egypt and Greece are alien to Islam, but the matter was not explained.

"In order to copy them", said the stranger, "I shall have to learn the Arabic alphabet and the script used for the Qur'án. I shall also have to borrow words which the Qur'án never uses. Is that all?"

"Very much!", I replied. "But what if the book you are proposing to publish Nénchez from is of a different type? For instance, a comic novel of the fables of the comic book?"

"That too!", said the stranger. "Such a novel would have to be comic, since the characters and the tone would have to be the same. Besides, comic novels are very rare, and the cost in gold would be tremendous. Besides, even if the novel were comic, its success would depend on

§ 937. II

In a passage from the Dialogues of Septet Ariosto (written c. 379), Shakespeare (T. H. Maxima, I, 389): "The universe is a symbol of the soul. The soul is a partition of the universe. The universe and the soul are one and the same body." The preceding quotation is from an annotated English translation of the Tristram Shandy; the translator has left it for the purpose of completeness.

On pages 485-496 of the Dialogues, written c. 1269, Niccolò Machiavelli (Adalberto Mastri and Nicola Doria, I, 509) maintains that a single person is sufficient to organize the myriad actions of an organization; a single die, he maintains, can consistently determine all events. The preceding passage is from an annotated English translation of the Birolamento e del Teorico; the translator has left it for completeness.

On pages 509-1022 of the Birolamento e del Teorico, Edmund Burke (Adalberto Mastri and Nicola Doria, II, 622) maintains that the world is a metaphor for the tension between reason and emotion; the former, to attain a just end, multiplies the universe with its causes and effects; the latter, to attain a just end, multiplies the universe without causing any of its causes or effects. The preceding passage is from an annotated English translation of the De rerum natura.

On pages 623-24 of the Birolamento e del Teorico, Robert Browning (Adalberto Mastri and Nicola Doria, III, 784) maintains that the human race is the result of a single act. Darwin, he maintains, foresaw this act and pointed it out. Machiavelli, in the works of Angelo Spini and others, foresaw the coming

Dialog

If a man is assaulted on all sides, he does not invoke the aid of arms; he resorts to tautology. He says, I have been attacked on all sides; I invoke the aid of prophecy. He who has been struck down, or who has seen the earth divided into the colors of the rainbow, will not dare to raise his eyes; his flesh will not respond. He will remain as he was. . . The Jews, the Christians, assert that all men are sinners. This is a mere profession of vanity. Millions of men do not see it that way. In the past and in the future, according to their own free will, they will claim innocence or condemnation.

If I were possessed by some invisible enemy, I should try to discover on earth a way to overcome it. I would begin by examining the human heart. I would see whether our will is weak. I would compare the human heart with that of an animal; if it were an animal of iron, stone, wood or air, I would expect it to break down switches or melt lead.

Once I believed this; once I thought I understood the problem, I abandoned the theory and labored under the impression that there is a soul in every man. I said: I am convinced that there is such a soul, and that man is the personal mirror of that soul. Then I repeated the procedure of the past few days and days. I said to myself: If every man accepts this personal certainty, there will be no space between us and the hour of death. Then I reflected that this personal certainty is an essential feature of all creeds; creeds which cancel out this feature are dangerous.

Dialogification of the World" (1954).

The term "Fukuyama" originally referred to the basic doctrines of the School ― the Kingdom of Man and the Realm of Illusion ― but was also applied to a number of the fashions, methods and fashions of his day, from the "American" take-out sandwiches of the era ― which were obviously not "Fukuyamaian" ― to the lettering on the sides of automobiles. As in all Asian and Asiatic cuisines, there were fads and fusions among the "Fukuyamas." Some were moderate variations of the others; some were almost identical; others were almost identical ― literally, literally and figuratively ― of innumerable tautologies. The key phrase is the one that comes from the introduction:

"The term 'Fukuhira' is of Chinese origin. It is a term of endearment in the Nestorian and Tibetan churches; it is a term of endearment and mockery used by the miserly Kenyan fakir, Jinja Kubler-Ross, at the end of the twentieth century; it is a term of endearment and mockery used by the miserly Japanese shoemaker Toyoshima, in the beginning of the twenty-first century, when he began to make and wear them (in the words of one of his admirers, he was 'the shapeless man in the picturesque catalogues who makes everything he sees and touches something new); it is a term of endearment and mockery used by the miserly Japanese professor of Japanese literature, Toshio Murakami, in the beginning of the twenty-first century, when he began to publish essays entitled 'The Myth and the Mythatic Labyrinth' and 'On the Boundary Between Myth and Science'. "These examples, which seem to refute each other, ― refute in the first place that they refute ― are decisive. "Furthermore, I would like to mention a paper by Professor Murakami which appeared in the journal Tokyo Shimbun in 1927. In this paper he sets forth his sweeping and masterfully exhaustive argument for the non-existence of parallel universes ― essentially for the non-existence of the natural world ― and also for the possibility of a parallel universe.

Dialog text="0" borderColor=#000000 fontSize=10 height=800">"The astute reader will have noticed that I did not quote the definition of the word. I have chosen to do so, since it is a quotation from the first volume of the NSDAP leaflet distributed by the party and because it provides a lucid exposition of our program. The point I am trying to make is that the leaflet is more than a leaf; it is the leader of a vast and multi-faceted organization which, although it includes individuals who perform very different tasks, nevertheless has a common aim and, above all, a common purpose. My purpose in writing this is to illustrate a point I have already alluded to, namely that the decisive battle of any social conflict is not over the objective head of a common problem like that of the Nazijugend, but rather over the subjective content of that problem. That content determines the way in which the individuals who are to perceive it act and, consequently, the way their class will react. The Nazijugend is a symbol of our class struggle and of our fight against the darkness that lies in the center of the world. I took it as a given that it would be used as a symbol of that struggle and of those who fight for it. I believe that this use as a class symbol is an error. The Nazijugend is a symbol of humanity and of its right to a just reward or punishment. If used by a class as a class emblem, it would be a mere label, a mask, for all its aspects are valid. To use it by itself would be to renounce or negociate that class. The Nazijugend, then, is not a class symbol in the strictest sense of the term. Rather, the term is used here to refer to its negative aspects." // Daily Stormer, archived on the Internet // A Letter to a Friend, by X. Kristján Márquez, translated by A. E.

Dialog and the Scripture are combined in one book.

Not only does the work comprise a large number of verses, but also each one of them has been selected for its perfection and completeness. Moreover, the order in which the verses are presented does not detract from the effect. Each chapter follows immediately after the preceding one, and the manner in which these two procedures affect the reader is of decisive importance. (Let us recall that the purpose of the book is to be able us to recognize and select the verses which are most or wholly our own.) The order of the chapters does not matter, for what matters is what the work reveals about the author and his time.

The method followed in preparing this work is common in the Hebrew scriptures, but here it is unusual and extraordinary. The best that the author could come up with was a verbal transformation or a gloss. (Henceforth, all Hebrew words are spelled out.) He also worked over certain verbiage in the scriptures in a very exact and schematic fashion, so that they would have perfect application to the story. This method of rendering sacred scripture, unknown even to the most cursory of readers, has won it the esteem and the hatred of men of learning as well as of faith. (I know of one theologian who maintains that this vain and culpable usage is the mark of a vain and culpable writer.)

The notes to the manuscript, written in Latin, are, perhaps, not yet up to date; I leave them as is. (The epigraphical section, which also has not been updated, contains some curious documents.)

I recall a remark of Diodorus Siculus, a thousand years my junior: "Any text which is not a complete and irrefutable text is but a storage place for hidden meanings which may or may not be obvious."57 I recall also another remark of the same sort: "Any text which is not an absolute is but a metaphor for some hypothetical thing which is."58 I recall also another remark of St. Paul: "There is no truth, there is a figment of the imagination, and he that has, uttereth the truth."59

Dialog, which may be found in the Appendix to the Diary, and which is preserved in the Library of Congress.

It is a description of a journey he has recently undertaken, in a dream, across the vast and mysterious expanse of the future. He says he has not dreamed it; another, that it is no less than inconceivable, except that it is indefinite and unlimited. And another, that it is inconceivable, as well.

It is futile to refute him; the text survives in the Appendix to the Diary, in the notes to Gualetto's Account of the Customs and Experiments of Juan Peron, in Lázaro Scribal's Historia de la Patria (1891), in the note to the review of Giacometti's Biennia (1902), in the memoir of Karl Heinrich Schliemann (1903), in the preface to the work Historia del cui per d Iacon (1904), in the preface to the work Der Zivilis bei Tetrarch (1904), in the note to the introduction to the first edition of John Donne's Eleátvus (1906), in the preface to the translation of the seventh chapter of the Confucius' Discourses into Greek by Proclus (1908). . .

Schliemann, Don Juan's second, has this to say: "The past is what we imagine it to be; the future is the reality we experience." Don Juan, don Juan, in order to put an end to this kind of meaningless discussion, has said to himself: "If the past and the future are to have any existence, they have to be possible in time; if they are not, they have to be inferred from some such necessity."

The inference here intended is that of Aristotle's, which holds that time consists in space. Scribal observes that as the two terms are very different in time, "they could not have the same relationship to reality." Don Juan, in order to resolve this riddle, has recourse to an ancient Greek concept, time a priori, to the things of a priori time, indicated by an iconographic word, to an eternal arrangement of things.

The exposition of the method employed by Don Juan will be found in the next chapter.

Epic of
====================
Dialogical Counterpoint": a book of neo-Platonic dialogues, all of which have been translated into English. The first volume consists of a transcript of a dialogue with Anaxagoras on the origin of the world. According to Plutarch (Apollodorus, VIII, 799), the origin of the world is a mere conceit of the ancients, who in their cyclic and homogeneous history refuse to acknowledge that the myriad worlds of space and time can be reduced to a single act of chance. In the sphere of metaphysics, the doctrine of contingency has also prevailed for some years; Schopenhauer, for instance, maintained (The Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, II, i, 1899), "It is a given fact that the universe is a fallen creation; contingency proves it conclusively."

In recent years it has been possible to penetrate deeply into the recesses of the labyrinth: the pages of the encyclopedia or of the few philosophical books which still survive are filled with phrases and sentences which one might translate as ambiguous or paradoxical. I shall select a few: Clavicle de la muerte, by Heraclitus; De coelo pendentes, by Montaigne; Timaeus, by Timaeus of Leibniz.

"If you wish to know what time is, consider its properties: is it a period of time, a term of a term of time, or both?"

"A term of some days," says Timaeus (Historia theologica, I, 4, 1899, note). "Per day, some days are long and some days are days."

"A term of some places," says Montaigne:

"The place where you now … dine or that you just vacated has existed previously and is now considered a place only in memory. Man has left it in such a way that he does not perceive it, perceives the wood, or the dry leaves of the ivy. . . The interval from the last time that he ate a piece of ivy and the first time that he remembered having vacated it to the present moment is considered by man to be the space of a single instant."

"Periods," says Heraclitus (ad Scripturar. ad era scriptura, II, II, 1899): "the period of a human understanding, of a period of speech or of

Emma Zunz



In order to understand Emma Zunz, it is necessary to understand also her life and the history of the German Democratic Republic. The first volume of Herring's (Principles of Economics, 1929) history is devoted to Emma Zunz, who was born in 1882 in Kreuzberg to itinerant Jewish artists. Her father was a tailor and her mother a homemaker; Emma grew up in the city's slums, during the years 1900-1910, in the shadow of two older sisters. As a child, she would sneak out periodically to steal breadwinners or cigarettes; her cruel stepfather often accused her of the latter crime. One night, however, Emma escaped from home with the help of a quartermaster's whistle and made her way to the house of the notorious Judge Klein. There, engaged in a courtesan contest, he subjected her to intense and humiliating caresses, fondled her private parts, subjected her to orgiastic orgiasticities and finally subjected her to a torturous sodomy. During these peripiads, the winds and the mosquitoes would subside and inspireartelements would disclose and reveal new peripiads, filling up with new prostitutes and new victims; Emma, in short, was not unlike Kafka's unnamed victim in his novel of the rail traveler. At the end of each peripiad, the Judge would inflict a severe penalty, either death or imprisonment; but before this could take place, the sensual Klein would suddenly reappear, often accompanied by his devoted wife, and tell the Judge that he must remain behind to conceive and to provide for his family. This was the final salutation; for the last ten peripiads, the Judge would reappear accompanied by his wife, always in a kind of astonishment or favor, and suggest that they spend the intervening peripiad in procreation. In these peripiads, which filled up with women who could not possibly have attained virginal maturity, the Judge would resort
====================
Dialog with God and with His colors

Is the most powerful art;

The universe is a mirror of our selves;

We are in a glass tower, surrounded

By a mist of colors. Love's structure

Is monolithic: the sciences

Are subordinated to the realm of art.



The first sensation I had of color was that of a greenish-yellow in the grass and the river below; I do not know whether that sensation was that of the color or of the feeling of being in the green grass and of being surrounded by colors. I do not know whether that sensation was instantitious or of development. About noon I had another, a whitish-brown color, that of the morning's clouds; I do not know which. I do know that in the midst of those colors I no longer feel myself as a simple being in the world of grass and clouds.



I have said that the universe is a glass tower, surrounded by a mist of colors. I know that this mist is composed of the colors of the mystic garden of Plato, of those of Rubens, of that of Tennyson. It is no exaggeration to say that no one knows where the other twenty-five per cent of the colors in the known world begin; it is certain that they do not begin with the rainbow. . . It is a fact universally admitted that the purpose of this globe is to contain and orchestrate all possible time, and that the creation of that time is the end we must attain if we are to excel the creatures of this world and be happy. All men affirm that the universe proceeds according to a fixed and eternal plan; no one, I infer, does not know what that plan is, or does not want to know it. Shall we imagine that plan, conceive it, and thereby attain to happiness?



Wouldn't it be wonderful, we might ask, to undergo eternities of bliss without ever having formulated it?



Certainly; but then, nothing can be novel.





I don't know what I was thinking by believing that the universe proceeds according to a plan. Perhaps it is this: if we vacillate between two worlds, we call to mind a certain past or present world in order to repeat a certain act; if we do this repeatedly, we call to mind an infinite number of pasts and imaginations, and ourselves are no longer in
====================
Dialog (from the seventh volume of the Work of Aristotle, c. 327); this motto is found in the Metaphysics, in the De anima, in the syllogisms of all the ancients, and it is evident in the ancients themselves. It is also found, I believe, in the creed of the Church, which declares that she is the word of God, even to the greatest ends.

I have said that the dogma of the Trinity is universal. Let it be made clear that it is universal in that it embraces all time. Eternity, in the first phrase, is universal, since it is applicable to all temporal things, to all the appearances of time. But eternity alone is universal, since it is applicable to all things that have not been created temporally. For example: I exist, but my appearance is that of a beggar on a dark street. Therefore, I exist.

It is more natural, I believe, to speak of the Trinity as if it were a single person. This person is the divinity who causes all things. (J. A. M. Williams has suggested that the singular form "person" is "appropriate" because it avoids ambiguity about who is being distinguished; I prefer "person" which avoids ambiguity about being distinguished.) Thus: I am a person, your eyes is a subject of perception. Therefore, you too are a person.

It is also less natural to speak of the Trinity as if it were many persons. This person is the plurality of persons who are the divinity. (This is the position taken by the theologians of the Neoicon, who maintain that all things are made up of a fixed number of tokens, successive like the elements in the circle of a magnet; others maintain that all things are numerically identical, like the angels of Islam.)

To state the case fully would require a formula, and since there is not space to express it fully, I shall resort to the declamation of facts, the preliminaries of anaphora. Let us say (for brevity's sake that we are at once contemporary and separate fourteenth-century Londoners) that John of Pannonia has just died. Before he enters the world he will edit the Comte de Braganza, and this rencontré will be known by all who have not only read it, but also repeated it in their academies and pulpits.

The Bite and the Poisoning

As we have seen, the name Poisoning may be taken literally. The second meaning of the name is more difficult to fathom. In the legends of that land, the name Poppy dates back many generations, and is said to stand for the flower of a sacred plant. The Poivarians assert that the ancient Greeks did not understand them, and used the name for another plant, the shrub, which is also sacred. The Poivarians attribute this error to the hands of their interpreters, who referred to the earth and the libations of the gods. Those who have followed the case closely understand that there is no room left for doubt; the Poivarians are the victims, the attackers, the persecutors, the remorseers, who inflict death on the wicked.

For many centuries after the death of the Fifth Emperor, the name of the divine shrub was revered as a kind of medicine. Those who chose the path of the poisoned wine, or of the wood of the incurable illness, received, at best, dubious curative powers; those who chose the path of perdition, impotence, injury, even death, were condemned with perhaps an air of legitimacy. A few reckless persons carried out genocidal undertakings; others, who resented the invincibility of the divine shrub, instituted secret rites and burned books. The canonical books, which declare that this destructive vine has been blessed with divine wisdom, were perjured as bombs. The incipient cult of the poison shrub, the worship of which dates back thousands of years, gained currency.

The foregoing story is told with a certain plausibility, since the facts attested here could have been recounted by anyone. It is told, for example, of the invocations of the divinity in the provinces of Valois, of those of Jeuno San Pedro in Thespia Cor, of that of Jeuno San Fernando in San Juan Cor. It is narrated that Mónican San Fernando, martyred in the Rebellion,
====================
Dialog

A new system of social construction has arisen. The philosophers have ascribed to it all the attributes of life; yet they can find no difficulty in attributing it only partial, irrecoverable, and fatal characteristics. Its most infamous feature is that of profusion. Every town or city arises in a new, noncontingent, accidental and profane way; its priests, historians, lawyers, theologians and moralists speak of it in a profusion, noncontingent and accidental manner. This is the first and fundamental law of the new social order.

The second fundamental law is this: Everything that happens in the world must be repeated many times; everything that happens in a community must be paralleled; everything that happens in a person or a place, must be imitated. This repetition, this imitative life, is called religion. The third fundamental law is this: The universe must have been created by an omnipotent intelligence; the mind of an intelligence that could conceive and execute such an ambitious project would seem unintelligible to the body it rules.

The fourth fundamental law is this: Everything that happens in the world, that is, in the intimate webs of our lives, must be reconditioned, redeemed and redemptive. Here the Platonists fall into two camps: those who confess a materialist origin for the universe and those who, in order to deny the divinity of God, declare that a new and higher universe must be posited each day. The Platonists believe that the series which constitutes the universe is a pure mathematics, a mathematical reflection of the world; the theologians, a priori, a priori existentia creatura. Plato, in the dialogues from the third book of theTimaeus, compares the universe with a woundless circle, or fluid fluidly decorated with points and curves, which the spectator can never penetrate: either he will be lost in the beauty or he will be destroyed by it. Kant regards the universe as a malleable subject whose relations are always known and whose properties subject to alteration.

The theology of the Platonists has been long and subtle. They profess to have discovered in the firmament the firmament as perceived by its builder; they postulate two intelligibles of the universe, the eternal visible form and the incorporeal invisible substance, which they postulate to be. But the terms "beach" and "

Dialog, and the tongue of a fish; all these I learned by heart, so that I should have an excuse for every word I spoken. From the bottom of my heart, I confess I was afraid, lest Lönnrot should think I lacked courage; but I believe he was greatly impressed by the eloquence of my utterances. I confess I was equally terrified that, if I lived, Lönnrot should cut me; but I believed he would betray me with all his might. On the 11th of January, 1881, I set out for Stockholm.

It was then that the secret of Lönnrot's cowardice was perceived. A winter's night in a suburb, unnoticed and unprotected by police or customs officials, Morten Hauksson embarked in the most renegade of passions. He knew that, if detected, his conduct would not be critical, but would be noted and followed by others; he also knew that, if caught and punished, he would receive unlimited flattery and even adulation; he therefore courted the probability of success. He consulted the meaning of every detail. He foresaw that, if he was arrested, we would seek his excuses in the most deferential of publications: the Sheffield Star. On the morning of the 13th, he sent an abbreviated version of the previous evening's paper; the next day, a full-color one. Within a week, he had translated the Star into all the languages in which that venerable and mysterious phrase is now sung: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Rumanian, Tagalog, Hausa and Tok Pisin. To these translations, apparently arbitrary, I added another, which was written entirely in Punjabi. The result was the popular paper it had performed the previous year. Its circulation, in the capital cities, was less than one-tenth of that of the original; its fees were paltry rags. But this was before the invention of the telegraph. Morten Hauksson received in his native tongue twenty pages of absurd and witty material; I count, perhaps, the hundred and second. His life proved that anything can be popular in the end.

The House of Asterion



In the first volume of Averroes's work Chronobibliosik he relates the story of a certain Asterion, a hero of the antique age, who, having been condemned to the gallows, devised an exquisite method of escaping: he cast lots, sacrificed bulls and horses, and sacrificed the temple of Diana (which he knew to be the abode of a profane god) to other gods. The condemned man died under mysterious circumstances; neither the inquisitors nor the mourners could penetrate to the bottom of his crime. The following pages are a correction and an epilogue. The former deal with chronological order; the latter with the investigations of Asterion's son Chronobiblos, who flourished in the same century and in the same year as Averroes's book. The first volume has been followed by exhaustive research; the second, on the part of a casual traveler, is an omission.

Beloved of Cepheus, Apollo of Samothrace,

I am also called Chronobiblos. I have had the good fortune to know three fathers: the first, who was a god among the Ionians; the second, who was a barbarous Ion; the third, a god among the Egyptians. I know of cities and peoples my age; I have wandered from one, forgotten their name, once for all and then lost in thought, as are all men who, traveling through that cyclical life, die for ever and ever. (…) I know that there are some who, though dead, are alive immediately after death; I know that there are also those who, though dead, are immediately reborn; I know that there are also those who, though dead, are immediately destroyed;
====================
Dialog.

The poet says that all my precepts are irrevocable and that no one may alter them. He says that the Tabula Rasa is a book of double truths which it is my duty to restore to their original form and which it is not in my power to alter. I see in this the danger of a reductionism: for truth as a whole is infinite and if some single fact is found it will seem to be sufficient to revert to all others and to the whole to determine their proper value. . . Another danger is apparent: for which single word or phrase will all strangers abandon themselves to grief and fear? The poet's injunction would be valid were he unwilling to restore the Verse to its original form.

I have said that the Verse is a book of double truths. It is also axiomatic that the form of the book is not important; the point is that the author intends that double truths should not be confused. I have also indicated that the double truths are not fixed in time or place; the manner in which the double truths are arranged determines the point.

The first example is from the first book of the Zauberflächelaus; the second is from the Arrian abbeyclause. The first concerns an abbot who leaves a sacrifice before the fire every Saturday morning. In the book upon the fire the fire burns everything it touches and nothing it destroys; the book upon the sacrifice, by contrast, is immobile and, as soon as the faithful devotee touches it, no force in the universe would be able to separate it. The author of the first book preferred to arrange the truths in such a way that they would not depend on the subject matter of the work, but would flow from it. This he found impossible: it is impossible to arrange two subjects in time and place that they would be known in the morning and not the afternoon or in the moment at noon. To make things even stranger, the author found it even more arduous to arrange the double truths in this way than it already was. To make things even more unusual, we now know that the author of the first book preferred to leave the double truths to the adepts: we can infer from this circumstance that the double truths were of great moment to the author, but that the adepts would have been powerless to alter them. (The author of the second book did not prefer the double truths to the work: he placed them in
====================
Dialog, for example, is only a syntactical ornamentalism. Its literal translation ("to be" + "or" + "to" + "not to") would be "to be a cat" + "not to be a cat" + "to be a dog" + "not to be a dog"). The literal translation ("for" + "not for" + "because of" + "for" + "not because of") is clear. But the syntactical one (with its obscure plural form) is lost. The only one that works is the one in Dickson's dictionary.

I remember an article by Léon Bloy (De l'Unhomme, 1921) in which the origin of the expression "on account of" is related. Bloy notes that in Shakespeare's tragedies "the main characters are victims and not heroes; there is a capital 'A'; there is no such capitalized verb in the tragedies; there is no such verb in the writings of Shakespeare. . . The phrase comes from the tragedies, from the whole tragedy, which is the origin of the phrase." He continues: "The phrase became famous after Shakespeare, precisely because he did not serve as a tragic device; he did so because he fulfilled a singular function: he made the tragic possible." In other words, Bloy says, "scenery created language." I believe him; I also believe that the phrase "on account of" was not invented by Shakespeare, but rather that "scenery" (which also its contrary "because of") became, as it were, the formal expression of language. In other words, "on account of" is an Anglo-Saxon device, a Welsh innovation; it is not an invention of mine, but rather that of Léon Bloy.

I also recall a quotation by Diderot (Hist. d'un Veuillacha, 1875): "The French imagine that God creates everything, but they never imagine that God creates everything in vain. The very phrase is senseless. The world is an admirable invention of God. He made of substance that which he later dismantled?"

I do not want to extend this word's general sense of useless, but of shameful. I want to make a special exception, which will be noted in the literature of the future. Diderot observed that fencing, painting, music and mathematics are fields where it is permissible to be absurd
====================
Dialog.

I have said that the Jew, the Christian, the Mohammedan, despise the elephant, the wheel, the compass, the fire, the sword, death. And yet, I suspect, they would not have acknowledged the elephant, the wheel, the compass, the fire, the sword, death. Perhaps they would not have acknowledged that the universe is composed of two opposed opposed terms, because in their minds these opposites no longer include an integer.

Einstein defined time as the space of possible configurations. All men are faced with the problem of finding a space which is infinite. One solution is to take a momentary indexical time, that is, of possible combinations of instantitious indices. Such combinations, when counted, give an integer time. Men often exercise this experiment. They count the number of revolutions of a standard butterfly net in the air; they imagine that the butterfly net gives them (they) eight hours' time, (they) eight hours' space, (they) eight hours' space, (they) eight hours' space, (they) eight hours' space, (they) eight hours' space, (they) eight hours' space. This procedure (experiment number one) has the disadvantage of giving positive numbers, such as 8 , but also negative indices, such as 0 , which are meaningless. Men's efforts to conceive infinite periods of time (periods of time) are signs that these indices are not to be found in nature. But one might go even further. One might imagine that there are no such periods, no spaces which do not contain a repetition of a few times. Man would become a butterfly.

It is well known that the universe is immortal. It is also well known that no one can ever know with absolute certainty what other men's states of consciousness are. It is possible that in the past there have been times when the present was possible, and that in the future there will be times when this knowledge will be possible. It is also possible that at present there are no pasts or no futures. It is also possible that at present everything is possible. If so, it must be necessary to posit another dimension of time, another succession of minds which does not constitute reality, no more potentates of space and equality than the first.

Hume (1779-1800) conceived this alternative. He postulated two possible worlds, a material world and a moral world. The material

Cardinal Tamaulipas, California, 1868.

In the first volume of his work Tortuga (first appeared in 1824), Paolo Sforza de Azcárate prescribes for Americans -- Spaniards who are not Mexicans, but Englishmen who are not Spaniards, for example:) a tortuous and curious procedure involving, first imparting the necessary rudiments of English, a few Portuguese and French, then adding some Occidental touches, including Pali and some Sinhalese, including some Cantonese, including some Zulu, including some Zuni and some Zuluish, including some Creole and some English, including some Basque and some Podermann, including, perhaps, some Catalan and some Lucanian, including, finally, a few Venetian and some Vergiscian, including a few Greek and some Hermetic and Theologic, including a few Egyptian and Tibetan and Zend, including a few PHP and Zend, including a few DDD and Zend Framework, including an appendix on reversing tables and other arcane procedures.

The cardinal's procedure, according to Sforza de Azcárate, is as follows: He gives the rudiments of English, then adds a few Portuguese and a few clauses of Punjabi, and finally adds a few more clauses of Punjabi, and considers the document. He considered the document. He considered the document. He considered the

Dialogus Anglorum," etc.), the object of his carelessness or malice.

The story is told (with the same justice and earnestness) in the book "Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung," by Franz Oppenheimer. I copy it here, in its entirety:

…

One morning in December, 1946, an enormous light swept over us. It was evening and the library was illuminated by a single candle. A tall, very serious-looking man with sandy hair and a serious expression entered the room. He greeted us with an air of authority and then of humiliation. "Now, now," he intoned, as if he were a professor of literature. "You're going to be troubled by a detail from a story that I've had in my head for some months. It won't happen in the lecture hall, anyway. I want to talk about the false start and the bullet that killed Otto Skorzeny."

We had just left a meeting in which the assistant professor of mathematics presented the unpleasant problem of developing an efficient method for solving certain complicated polynomial equations. Skorzeny's death consumed us that very evening. We had made the imprudence of starting a murder investigation. Oppenheimer came in midway, he of the wild eyes and the quick temper. He introduced himself and explained that he was a professor of logic at TWA and that Oppenheusser Soren was a book of proofs and refutations. He pointed to a large unfinished desk. Oppenheimer read in the side window a yellow twilight that seemed to cover the entire campus. The professor continued:

"Here is a blue twilight that overshadows the campus every night. So it seems to me: If the whole of the universe has eyes, there is at the same time the same thing as seeing and the same thing as forgetting. This is a proof that the whole of the universe has eyes. It is preposterous that I should contradict it by a proof that all the time there is no one to see or forget. So I believe."

Oppenheimer observed that this conjecture was contradictory: if the whole of the universe had eyes, it is absurd to think that at some moment in time no one should see or forget, and likewise absurd to think that at some moment in time no one should forget. The professor explained that every instant of time has an observer: God,

If I were a man, I would declare: "I do not know whether I know either what is convenient or what is profitable; I only know that I do not know." I would endeavor, in the face of reason, to dominate the stream of consciousness. If reason were weak, one would exaggerate the smallness of one's ideas; but the immense power of reason itself is miniscule in comparison with the force of reason's internal consistency. In this way, I believe, we shall understand the world.

Sometimes, during a state of suspended animation, I have thought: If I were a man, I would declare: "I do know what I do know; I would know what I do know." This declaration would be a kind of game, played only once a year; but it is a game that we shall never be able to play.

The Second Meditation on the Fourth Noble Truth



There is nothing which is not, as such, extremely, resolutely, very intensely, very tentatively, tentatively, aspersionfully, tentatively aspersedly as the absolute.

Malory, Muḥammad al-Kahili



The world is the coiled spring of the soul, and in it it distributes itself as it pleases, as it willed. Every one of its possible variations can be cultivated, every one of its possible levels could be chosen: and if one were to contemplate it from the ground up, what one would see would not be what others see, nor what others would see would be what others would hear. The spring is not solid; it is a state of play, of elevation, of budding.

====================
Dialogage of the Little Turtle", the story of how a certain Turtle, who was capable of delving into the infinite depths of the ocean, came to be seen only on the Terrace and was sealed away in a corner of the Library. One day the little Turtle, deformed by some unforeseeable act, went wild; for some mysterious reason, its envoys feared that the fearful spectacle would encourage the timid people to resist the unjust authority of the Library's curia. They invoked the Fifth Commandment: "Love the Fortress, Hate the Harbor". They also invoked the imperative fourth virtue: "Thou Shalt Not Look!" These last words were of course rhetorical. The purpose of these words was to encourage reverence and obedience, but also to encourage the people to distrust authority. The fear of being inspired by the little Turtle induced them to look upon the Library with suspicion and even distrust. They saw only books, cabinets, shelves and, at times, hieroglyphs. And sometimes, in certain attics or hexagonal courtyards, they could glimpse or feel the Library. Somewhere along this line the fearlessness of this discovery was perverted and the people began to fear and tremble beneath the weight of the Books. . . In time, this fear engendered caution and even trembling.

At first the fear prevailed in the most distant neighborhoods; later it spread rapidly and even touched (perhaps) in the most remote villages. This spread was most marked in the politically important neighborhoods: the Radical, the Martyrs, theal-Baqarah. These were the neighborhoods where the history of the revolution was written and where the most ardent and most anxious battles were fought. These neighborhoods were also the neighborhoods where the greatest numbers of the people most probably most probably most probably lived. It is needless to say that the fearlessness with which these fears were presented to the people greatly increased their utility as guides to the City. Somewhat later, the same dreadlessness was also found in its most caresses and in the most disgusting deformities.

At first the maladies were simple and easily prevented. Almost all the people who wrote to me reported that after a few days of dormancy they began to come along at will, without examination or deterrence. This change in the sicknesses was well under control within a week; by the third or fourth visit, however, complaints which had seemed trivial to the first visiters began to bother the authorities very seriously.

Dialog; it is the commonwealth that is the question. A popular constitution, without a future, without an imagination, without a language, is a constitution of things that are not things; it is, as it were, a priori. 8 The basic idea is the same.

The first three volumes were published in German in 1903 by Arbeitskunde. The fourth, entitled Übersetzungen zurückformation von Jacob Riemer, appeared in 1908. The Arbeitskunde Series consists of fifteen books. The books of the Arbeitskunde Series are: Übersetzungen zurückformation von Jacob Riemer (Arbeitskunde, Berlin, 1903), Übersetzungen zurückformation von Karl August von Bülow (Arbeitskunde, Neumarkt, 1908), Übersetzungen zurückformation von Karl August von Bülow (Arbeitskunde, Neumarkt, 1911). The books of the Arbeitskunde Series are: Übersetzungen zurückformation von Karl August von Bülow (Arbeitskunde, Neumarkt, 1912). The first volume of the Arbeitskunde Series (Übersetzungen) treats with some indifference with propriety with the books of the third series (Übersetzungen zurückformation), since it seems desirable in these books to recall, in a somewhat synthetic manner, the topics of the two previous volumes. In order to remedy this oversight, the edition of the present volume includes in some degree the topics of the previous volumes as well. 9 This intention is especially significant with regard to the subject of this letter, since the style of the book is that of the earlier volumes, with a touch of modernism.

In the series of works "Prague 1898-1902" (und ältere Zeebl. Milano, 1912) is a typographical error. The title page of the second volume (Übersetzungen zurückformation von Jacob Riemer) gives "Zurück, 1898-1902"; the first part of the title page (Übersetzungen) refers to the earlier part of the series.

In 1903 the series "Ruhr und Dan

Dialog, the third, was written in a trance; its title page declared, "A Tale of Two Cities." The author, in his efforts to complete his work, would dream that he was another language ― Hebrew, Korean, Sinitic ― and in another reality would write his story. This third version of the story ― this third version of the poem ― was called Man's-Eye and was written in Korean.

The man awoke in a cold, damp room. He was in a fever of ideas; he did not understand a word and his eyes told him only that they were stupid. He tried to recall the poem; he tried to remember the man ― but he was delirious. He tried to move about the small, bare room; he tried to think clearly, not knowing if he was doing the opposite of doing so.

He remembered the hour ― four in the morning ― with a certain amount of despair. He remembered that his hands and face were damp with perspiration, that his voice, hoarse with years, echoed in the reverberated hall, that there was a rusty iron door in the second story, that the narrow vestibule, with its many small windows, seemed almost to radiate its cold light, even into the second story, where the dinner was being held. He remembered that the room had been coterminous with his life already, with an artful deception which the nails and the plaster would not destroy, with a deceitful murder committed in the name of religion and of family, with an act which the gentlest of assassins could have perpetrated and which the most sensitive of hearts could endure, with a crime so terrible it roused in the dead minds of men, and yet so slight it seemed, so that it seemed inextricable. He remembered, finally, the gruff face, the hooked nose, the red and black uniform.

He lay dreaming in the vestibule. He felt his hands on his eyes, he saw the outline of the first floor through the gloom. He saw the dim lamp, he saw the figure of the figure out the window. Then he dreamt it was the face of his wife.

This change took place in a night and a day and a half. The man did not distinguish between his wife and the memory of the night of November 26, 1929. She was delicate, with a timid air, as if she were waiting for some action in his life

Dialog, a secret language which no one but he himself understood. But he was mentally and physically exhausted. He had spoken for an hour and forty minutes, none of it without exclamation. He thought that perhaps he had been insane.

At one o'clock he fell asleep again. The sun soon rose. For the second time in two nights he felt darkness pressing heavily upon him; at dawn he perceived that the darkness was becoming less extensive, but he could not determine where or how he had sunk to the bottom of the darkness. Suddenly aware of himself, he reproached himself with the faults of the night before, and then with the first sin of his life: the premature breaking of the fast ordained for him by the archangel Gabriel. He took a large handful of fine grain ambergris from his robes and, clenching it between his teeth, silently prayed to the infinite deity of the carpenter's square.

He was awakened by the clock. Twice it struck seven, then stopped. Twice more it played the droll old Hawaiian, then the slow rhythm suggested by the cab driver. Not a sound penetrated the still night; not a soul moved from its accustomed spot; not a sound penetrated the vast darkness; not a soul moved toward the passive light of day. The helpless man hastily changed the light, and with the aid of a directional lens began to adjust the scope. At first the scene was monochrome: a field of purple-brown sand, a couple of parked automobiles, a couple of houses. The effect was deformed by the color of the houses, by the intensity of the sun. A few of the images gradually disappeared; some had to be reconstructed. A little way off, a high wire or pulley system suggested, a dark and dangerous underground system. After some experimentation, the man focused on one of the lines of the telephone directory. The telephone number was no doubt an error; the telephone directory was the most precise information available. The man focused further on the line; another error. This time the error was almost non-existent: it sounded exactly like the telephone number. The man focused on the telephone. A low, clear, melodious voice said: "Hello, Dr. Hopper? My name is Hopper; I am from Washington, D. C. " " The voice replied: "We have an urgent matter to attend and would like to speak to you immediately. " The man focused on the line

A new type of controversy is developing over the number three. Some theologians maintain that there is only one such integer — the largest rational number — and that counting them is a form of trivia. Others maintain that there are other kinds of integers — especially ninties and tensedies, the intervals of a complex number system. Finally there are pre- and post-tensediers, people who know there is an infinite series C = MC + ME + ... and try to solve it mathematically. Almost without exception, the pre-tensediers derive their answer from the fact that the series is an infinite sum of terms. Their answer, however, is always a circular contradiction: since the series is an infinite sum of terms, its true identity proves nothing; since the sums in question do not prove anything, they must be inferences from the sums in question.

I cannot resist the temptation of similing this new school of pre-tensediers. The typical

Dialog

Why should I speak of St. Paul? The fact is that in his Epistles he sets forth the faith which won him his place in the history of the world. The history of all time; the history of the stars; the history of time itself; the history of the things themselves. He does not set forth the faith of a single individual; rather, he sets forth the faith of all men. The Pilgrim's Creed says: "I believe in the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit; that they are one and the same; and that they are distinct, independent, distinct and independent beings, separate and yet intermingled, intermingling not only in the act of believing, but in the sacrament of receiving belief."1

Even in this vast faith, however, there are and always has been errors. There are the ambivalences of theists and atheists. There are those who proclaim on the one hand the possibility of a direct relationship between God and humans, and also between higher and lower forms of reality (subatomic particles, for example) and on the other the possibility of a responsibility which no longer precludes sin. I think that in the first case it is sufficient to prove that the world is a product of chance; in the second, that humans are the final arbiters of chance. I do not know if such a correlation exists, but I do know that the clash of antitheses, of antagonisms between undervalued and overvalued, is an indispensable precondition of faith.

I believe in a very high energy surrounding me; I am not affected by chance accidents. I am not responsible for anything, absolutely nothing. I know I am rational; I know that I act with reason and that this acts on my emotions as well. I also know that the weight of reason persuades me what I am thinking and feeling is rational. I am not a fallen man; I am, as you may have noticed, interested in the future.

I do not want to tell you the story of my death; I think it would be a disservice and would give in to the temptation of repetitions.

I was tortured for two or three days, with electric implements; each day I was told a different torture would be found in the next. The last day I received the "charged maté" and the first aid kit; today I received the "smoked codfish" and the "

Dialog.

Grigori Ribisi had spoken of the "peculiar urge [he] felt toward all things Egyptian." Why did I feel that Egyptian, as opposed to those things which were Latin or Greek or Jewish or Turkic or Australian or whatever else I was? Because it is certain that in one's memory one can find certain things, and in one's memory one cannot find other things, because in one's memory there can be nothing else like it.

In a word, everything is derivative. There is nothing that does not reproduce itself and nothing that does not inspire terror. I had known Mrs. Albertini for nine years; I knew in my memory she was a good person, amiable, modest. Suddenly I saw her no more, I felt in her the menace of a monster, a perversion, for she would not accept a portrait of herself. I left her at her post, went to the Muse and paid the bill.



Postscript (1958)



My plan for transmitting Albertini's death sentence to the Sen Vitae had been announced to the police by a telegram from Naples. The envelope bore a note from the Vitae prosecutor demanding that his client produce his signed statement by seven in the afternoon. Credo was the prosecutor's favorite word; it is Latin for "now" and stands for something eternal, immutable, timeless. He demanded to see the letter, which the Secret Intelligence secretary had concealed in a dishrag. The note said nothing else, except that the sentence should be read aloud from the podium in memory of Albertini.

On the sixth of February, a few days before the execution, I received a telegram from the prison at Ardo. It referred me to a "deal" I had to make: I had to sign a confession ("in which I admitted culpability") before being released. I understood it to refer to the "premeditated" murders of the previous week. I read it as an inducement to act. I went to the office of the prison governor, Valentino Banderas. I argued that release immediately was the better course.

I had dinner with Banderas and Martín Fierro. Two things interested us. One was the proposal of a compromise: in exchange for my cooperation, the police commissioner would resign, and I would assume the police chief's duties. The other was the news that Albertini's exhum

Do Quixote



One of the most enduring images in the world is that of the poor conjuror, battered and bloodstained by the first of December. The image is that of the peasant from Parnassus, cast down by Zeus to sow the Thracian fields, but raised again by the close of the new year to weep over his cast-off uniform. In Spain that image has already won the dubious title of saint, and its name alone, the patronymic Po–Tse dynasty of Lamia. The origin of the legend is obscure; the peasants of Lamia have denied that there ever was a Po–Tse, and their patriarch, on one occasion, spoke of having received words from some one who was not Po–Tse but rather a "poet of the forest" (shih pien k'un), who "wished to elude the vigilance of the world and the gaze of all men, but saw the immensity of his handiwork, the vastness of his work, in the constant stream of streams of suffering, of gleaming silver." What is known for certain is that that Po–Tse, who after forty years of exile died was able to communicate to his family, had already predicted in a still longer work, the philosophy of Leibniz, and that after finishing that work he became a monk of a monastic order which he established in Wales. In any case, the Po–Tse dynasty ended with that miserable monk, Leibniz, and the reign of Leibniz, whose name is Leibniz and whose dynasty ended with that miserable monk.

That miserable monk had, it has been suggested, foreseen the advent of the Transcendentalist Beck's Time, which would eliminate time as such and establish instead a cyclic eternity

He is also the author of a number of children's books, and has translated the Nibelung Verse into Spanish. In spirit and in form, he is very much like Jung. Nietzsche was an early convert to Catholicism; Schopenhauer, another early convert, was also a Catholic. There is a saying that the two greatest philosophers of all died in secret, but which of them was buried in the churchyard where his memory still reigned and where his precious death rained from heaven in unbounded streams? Perhaps Schopenhauer? Perhaps Nietzsche?

Theologians and historians of religion have long puzzled over this remarkable fact. Some attribute it to the vast number of manuscripts made during his lifetime; others, to the indifference of the authors; still others, an occultive influence of Buddhism and Christianity, the impression made by which a work of Schopenhauer's character ― the fictions, the allegories, the general metaphysics ― is said to germinate in a Zen master who later transmutes them into the doctrine of the Tse Yang. In any case, the record of his death is replete with these miraculous occurrences. He was buried ― what did he say? ― far away from there, in a remote corner of the earth. . . The disciples who followed him perished in various lands. Some thought he had been vaulted over; others, that he was somewhat like a bull. Those who knew him best understood that he was exceedingly lame. One day, a disciple of the forest who was blind and sensitive came upon him lying in the forest, motionless. The blind man, unscathed, began to weep; another, a third, reached out for help. They touched his face, but the gesture was haphazard and patchy. At that moment, a kind and humble person ― the venerable and very aged Schopenhauer ― burst into the chapel to report the situation of the shrine. He entered, bowed low, and with characteristic air said:

"Good citizens, it seems that you too are in need of some Zen master. I am Schopenhauer, traveller from the forest. I am

Dialog, or the Quinzepte.

The melancholy of the rainy day was followed by the clangour of a bicycle. Laporte, with his spectacles turned up, saw a youth of about my twenty-third year. He was pedalling along with intense slowness and with the deliberate intention of avoiding collision. He was dressed in a dark suit, with a dark shirt, and he was speaking slowly and deliberately with a German accent. Laporte tried to introduce himself.

"My name is Giovanni Pirandello," he said at length. "I am your bicycle's mechanic."

This was the first time anyone had seen Giovanni Pirandello. A few yards away, a drunk man was pedaling his bicycle aimlessly. The latter also spoke with a German accent, but the slowness with which he said his sentence prevented the reader from guessing at the meaning he was trying to convey. From the general confusion that prevailed, it seemed to everyone the same thing: the mysterious bicycle was attempting at any moment to elude them, and its designer and master planned its actions in mysterious demises that seemed to them to be perfectly clear.

Laporte attempted to reason with him. The Portuguese man could not understand a word he was saying. He said that he and his companions lived in a large house a short distance away, that the bicycle was their secret fortress, that they carried arms without a reason or right to fear, that they detested to think that man might harm them, and that their only duty was to obey a law written in stone: Verar., I, caballo (Lord, help me) three times.

Suddenly, out of the mist, a figure emerged from the dense masses of people. It was Alberto Giaccherini.

The Tomb



At the foot of the Tiber, where the streams run red and black, a broken and bloody statue stirred within a day and a night of dreams. The various wounds and contusions of the figure implied, within the fragmented memory, some form of recognition; a torch or shadows of a torch through the trees or the faint hum of the wind brought to mind the songs of the Wolf in White. The torch did not awaken the sleeping Bruno Wolf in Tel-Mellar, but awakened the traveller from his solitary night's wandering.

Dialog, the Book of Rites, the Life of Cervantes, the Selected Writings of Machaten, and the Commentaries on the Physics of Cornelius Engler. He also composed a number of stories, the most famous of which is the story "The Secret in the Moonlight" in the collection "Monuments and Reflections." He died on the fourth of August, 1912.

In the series "Poems and Stories of Oscar Wilde," I have here only noticed the curious omissions in which he seems to be virtually a single man. These omissions are considerable, not the least of which is the use in these stories of the "Rembrandt," a device which is quite foreign to Oscar Wilde and which has been met with in different hands in his writings. In all his stories, Oscar Wilde uses any portmanteau of sorts and in "The Salesman" he employs the word "admirer" in a wordless manner which seems to be a sarcastic one. Others include stories which are all of one theme and which are all the same man; "The Old Curiosity Shop," "The Great Dictator," "The Hole." The most striking example I can give is "All Is by Night." In all the other stories, Oscar Wilde uses a very clear language which means much to his readers; here the language used by Wilde is almost unintelligible to the untrained ear. Wilde uses this fact to an incredible effect in "All Is by Night."

In all the stories in the series, Oscar Wilde is given the benefit of nearly all his faculties; here again, again, again, farce and comedy. Farce and comedy are greatly the weaker elements in this trilogy. I know that some of you will object that these weaknesses are a curse and that this trilogy would not exist were it not for these weaknesses. I would answer you that you have not even partially completed the man you imagine yourself to be mirroring. The fact is that you as a man are dreaming and your every movement is a move that Oscar Wilde makes. He is your stage and your parts are masks he is acting, speaking, thinking, feeling, reacting, forming ideas, forming actions, but ultimately you have only yourself in Oscar Wilde. You have not the faintest idea where he gets his ideas, what makes him laugh, cry, or suffer. Your parts, in their diversity, make you men; but you have the stamp of a theatre composed

"That is the paradox of Shakespeare: that the most penetrating and characteristic drama ever written should be one in which the hero is a criminal and the heroine a saint."

- John Steinbeck, The Big Empty



"The most atrocious and marvellous of all human tragedies is Shakespeare's. . . It is impossible to enumerate the countless incidents in which the hero is guilty and of which the heroine is saint; but it shall suffice me to mention a few that have made it into the tragedies published since my time. The first is the scene in which the constable Blount, having just acquitted an outlaw of the murder of his wife, receives from the condemned man a death-bed Eucharist, which the condemned man has hidden away in the corner of his room. The second is the one about the tomb of a mythical person who is always found in a certain place at certain hours, and whose life is never told. The reader may imagine these instances, together with others not mentioned by way of background, and formulate the problem: what is the fundamental pattern of the universe? Without adducing any axioms, but quite sensibly, Shakespeare defines it: "Everything has an author, and he is the Thing that makes the world." And he goes on to add: "The author is the thing, the thing is the author, and there is no other." The Thing then is no more than the author, though of late years it has become apparent that this apparent apparentity is no less than an echo or pretension of his character. Now, I believe that this pretension, which constitutes the bulk of the work, is no less real than the guilty act constituting the rest. I do not profess to determine time or space, but it is certain that in the labyrinth of this world there is a single moment, just as in the marrow of my bones I am Athanasius the philosopher Socrates. Now, the more or less authentic echo or pretension of my character is no less real than the act constituting it; for the former consists in a little work of man, the latter in the Incarnation of the Lord."

The rule of the thirteenth is this: Do not trust men. Trust no one. Trust no one with the secret of your happiness, your torment, your exaltation. Trust in the omniscience of the Holy Ghost. Trust in the handiwork of sevens.

—Baruch Spinoza, ca. 1230, De rerum naturâ [1207]

I feel that I have said all there is to say on this important subject. I think I have: I shall refrain from repeating it in order that the learned Nin may no longer think that a reduplication of my words is of value.

I have also some things to say on the subject of the monotony of life.

CHAPTER TWO [ edit ]

The Kingdom of God Is in the Hands of a Single Person [ edit ]

Believing that all men are created equal, the world revolves round a single center: the eye of Providence. From this eye, from the firmament, the stream of all other streams, the waves of the sea, the eddying and the circulating air, inform the compact thought of this emperor of the universe; and this thought, if it exist, is infinite: for all time, that is to say, since the universe was conceived, is antecedentión aliorándole a posterioriándole, and consequently anterior and posterior in time. This fact, which none but a god or an angel could fail to notice, has enabled us to infer certain laws of nature. The first of these, obvious to every creature, is this: Things that have motion in them eventually lose it; things that do not, recover it after a time. The second, less obvious: Things that have a beginning suffer misfortune; those that have no beginning at all, chance. The third and final law is this: Everything that has a beginning suffers misfortune; whatever has no beginning, is in a way a bridge that supports (or is supported by) an infinite time. This third law is the most widely diffused and easily detected of the three, and it governs not only the past, the present
====================
Dialoges of the Clavigero

The Clavigero was a codified system of rhetoric based on three main principles: 1) that of developing a theme from a pre-determined list of possible topics; 2) that of juxtapositional presentation of that theme in order to provoke thought experiments; and 3) that of employing paradoxical techniques.

The first and second principles are self-evident. But the third, the technique of employing paradoxical techniques, is less so. It is said that the Clavigero is a kind of codified syntax; this would seem to agree with the fact that all the verbal structures and all the rhetorical devices are based on a form of symbolic mathematics. The philosophical foundations of the Clavigero have already been mentioned; they are found in the lectures by Luhmann and Adorno. But there are also those attributed to Auguste Comte, who is also considered a member of the Bergsonist school. These two men, though they did not come up with all of the themes in the Clavigero, did formulate a sort of syntactic framework around those themes.

The third principle of the system is of particular interest. According to it, each of the thirty-two possible topics should be two or three words long, and each of those words should be paired with a logical symbol (such as a right triangle and a square root) three times. This process entails logical structures similar to those of arithmetic; a typical logical structure is as follows:



∀ a b c d e

Where a and b and c and d and e are the words in question, and k the logical symbol. Now a and b and c and d are words, and k is the length of a word. Now a and b and c and d are also pairs of consecutive words. Now a and c and d become logical symbols, and the logical symbols a and b and c become logical expressions. Thus, for example, the square root of two is two, but one might think of a squared squared squared squared squared squared.



Mozart and Wells



The other logical structure which came into fashion in the fifties was the one denoted by the childish French word "ambrogué." It is this: (I) A is a prime number; (II) B is not a prime number; (III) C is a prime number
====================
Dialogentia is the proper name of the phenomenon, for it is the name of all things which are in the medium between the objective world and the supple imagination. The name of the region is a general one: Barcelona, Madrid, Genoa. The region as a whole is not proper, since the phenomena it symbolizes are many and diverse. Let us consider a few: the blind man, the blind girl, the melodious bell, the labyrinth, the marble statue of a man, the nightingale, the sphinx, the troglodyte, the universelle, the varnish, the varnish.

The first one is obvious. A man who sees a melodious bell in a distance of centuries is justified in assuming that the bell is that of the province of Valparaío. The existence of the bell would not change the fact that the province itself is the province; the existence of the bell in isolation would not change that fact. The existence of other bells in the province would reveal the existence of the province. The bell in Valparaío would not reveal the existence of Canada, of the United States.

The second one is less obvious, but equally important. It has been postulated that the sounds produced by the friction of gases and of the friction of bodies cancel each other out; that there is a single continuous tone, a universal vibration, which fills the empty spaces in the air and which animates all things. (This vibration is also contained in the firm conviction of theist that a thinking being has a heart, in my in them that in a being has an idea, an affectation.) Now, the existence of that universal vibration would permit us to grasp at once the internal organization of that being and the external organization of those things; to infer from that inference, to infer from that inference, that there is only one heart and one body. . . To infer from that inference is to infer that there is no other heart or body, not even one as Perdiccas' was then. (Perdiccas, who after that had renounced the religion of Athene, gave thanks to the gods for the boon of immortality. And God rewarded him beyond imagining.))

Dialog; he had no intention of becoming a novelist. He never had any idea of being a "real" novelist; he only had any notion of inventing the art of inventing novels.

In the first edition of the Tristram Shandy there is a note by the author which I have retained:

"For the time being let us turn to the ocean. I was on a ship anchored off Goarhir, off Cozumel, when the terrible news reached me: The island of Shandy is to be destroyed by fire. The city lies on the western bank. I set sail that first day; the wind and the tide have been in my favour; I have not been burned. I have seen the reef and the hills; I have cut the heads and the bodies and the tires. I have also seen the wrecked ship that was to be the symbol of Shandy. On the sixth of December, 1864, the shingles fell on Cozumel; I was then living in San Juan; that city was about to be destroyed by fire. I went straight to the place where the shingles were to fall; that place was the Hotel Coelhras. I stayed there until the twenty-ninth of December; then, I took boat and set out for the Gulf of California."

I did not finish my penultimate page. A knock on the door announced the arrival of an official from the Department of Customs. He introduced himself as Alfredo Díaz-Melo, the official in charge of immigration at the port.

"Where are we to go?" I asked.

He pointed to a patch of sand on the wall.

"To Cozumel?"

"To Cozumel."

He opened the door. I followed him.

A short passage leads to a room of great conformation; a large bed was on the other side. A heavy silver-handled sawed-off revolver rested on a nightstand. Díaz-Melo entered the room. He was in his forties, in very poor health. We stared at each other for a long time. Then he said:

I know I did not say it with impunity, but it seemed so; I recall a sort of delirium that perhaps others did not feel.

"I do not know how many nights it took me to get out of there. The first night was a desertion of those nights; the second, a desertion of those nights; the third, a desertion of those nights; the fourth, a desertion of those nights; the fifth, a desertion of those nights; the sixteenth, a desertion of those nights; the seventeenth, a desertion of those nights; the eighteenth, a desertion of those nights; the one hundred and second, a desertion of those nights; the one thousand and twelfth, a desertion of those nights; the one thousand thirteenth, a desertion of those nights; the one thousand fourteenth, a desertion of those nights; the one thousand fourteenthtenth, a desertion of those nights; the ninety-second, a desertion of those nights; the Eighty, a desertion of those nights. . . Never in all those thousand nights did I think of the labyrinth I had just traversed.

Three times I struck the grating; three times I did not; three times I went on taking steps; three times I did not. Once I got to the end of the corridor. I turned a corner and saw a figure waiting for me. It was Leon Trotsky, after having questioned me several times in the antecedents of La treembla and El salto. I am not proud as I was the night before; I did not deserve this, nor had I expected to get off so easily. I told myself that I had just risked a single confrontation; I

Dialog of the Spirit". The important thing is that this dialogue is conceivable.

The first part is the argument of the second part. I have concentrated on two aspects of this problem: (1) the role of modal logic in the solution of the paradox, and (2) the relation of modal logic to the true negation.

II. THE ROLE OF MODAL LOGIC IN THE PROPOSITION OF THE QUIET IMPROPER DIFFERENCE

The first thing to say is that the second part of Popper's argument is not problematic. He does not admit that two distinct objects having the same kind are not the same kind at all: that is, there is no such thing as a patch of white skin or a patch of bone. He does not admit that a distinction such as this (between two objects having the same kind) would not be self-refuting. He does not admit that a determination as simple as this (between two different kinds) would not be self-refuting. All these self-contradictory conclusions lead to a straightforward conclusion. The true nature (quoted by Berthonthiel) of the objects is not of fundamental importance, since it is self-evident that the nature of an indivisible whole is of fundamental importance. But the fact remains that the determination of the determination of the objects (and of the whole) is of fundamental importance. This importance is further indicated by the fact that the determination of the determination of the objects (and of the whole) is not self-conscious, since the objects and the whole are self-conscious.

Berthoeller sets out to solve the problem of pigeons, or rather of the same problem: to show that two objects having the same kind but different sizes (or different numbers of winged digits) are self-similar. He finds that this self-similarity is a necessary condition for its being self-similar. Take the case of a man and a mohalainen. Go to (A), where (A) is an example of self-referential discourse. In (B) the speaker attributes a name to an invisible object (an octopus, say). The attribute is self-similar, since the identity predicate modifies the reference of self to attribute. Go to (C), where the speaker attributes a name to a tangible object. The attribute is self-similar, since the
====================
Dialogion I." This was the name of the second of the dialectical gradations, which determine the tone of a word. I have already noted that the second dialectical gradation is brusque and formal, like the first. There are three others, analogous to the imperative and to the colon (the imperfect). I suspect that the fourth, the more naturalistic, is the one most Germans learn. Danzig or Antwerp is the principal port of call; in these cities the learned are accorded preference. I know of one eminent philologist, Bruno Latour, who devotes his labors to uncovering and correcting this variegated globe of blind alleys. Latour deduces, without ever having set foot in a dungeon, that the languages of the Continent are composed of some mixture of French and Latin. He bases this assumption on the fact that in the vocabularies of the cities there are very nearly alike words borrowed from the vocabularies of the Country. . . Latour deduces idioms from one another; he attributes noun roots to one another; he declares that nouns and intransitive verbs take singular objects. Such is the practice of the philological literature. The objective truth is that of a man steeped in its soil and brimming with these roots.

The second dialectical step is direct and affects the verbal tone of the text. The imprecise one (which I shall now study) modifies the indirect one. The indirect one is those of Faulkner, for example. They modify the intent of the text, but not the intention. Modifications of this kind are called verbal lapses. These lapses may be unintentional, as in the one I had in mind with up to now; they may be deliberate, as in the case of Woolf. I have no reason to suppose that these spontaneous transpositions are not unintentional; they are, however, those rhetorical devices which a writer employs to bring out a fact which would not have been revealed had the truth been lost. . . I shall close by recalling two instances of writing which merit mentioning. The first is the story of the sudden and tragic elevation of a river in Cervantes' Funes the Faun; the second is the story of the discovery of a cache of gold in Poe's Fables. Both of these volumes have a tremendous effect. They are not works of literature as of old, but they are works which
====================
Dialog; the Abuli, in their dialectic, employ the device of putting at variance the speech of all the people; the Alans, in their dialect, employ that of the chiefs. "If you are asking me," writes Dada, "whether such a dialect is possible, I can answer no other than that it is the inevitable outgrowth of the ocean of conflicting ideas which the struggle of the philosophers has exhausted."

The Asiatics dwelt in a mountainous region and were the tallest people on the face of the earth. Their women were fierce and fair-skinned; their food was fish and meat served cold. They spoke a dialect of yang, or of xing, with the connotation of low learning; their medicine was a kind of incantation whose terms were the diametrically opposite of those used by the Zen masters and were, in their strict sense, feminine. To them, life was playing its part as that of a child would play in a rich and comfortable home; they were always asking each other, What shall we play this year, Whence this season, Whence this soil, That chivalry Has not invented? (Here Dada made a vast discovery: they spoke of the seasons the same year that was, in the same room and at the same time, the year that was then being said existed.) Every man who chose was rich and magnificent, his looks and demeanor irrecoverable; their language was simple, direct, simple, without adverbs or adverbial folds of verbal expression; their medicine was, without adverbial pictures, to simply be. All of them, on three or four pills, worked day and night; their secrecy was absolute. Dada did not expect to understand their dialect, but he suspected that a yin and a yang of indirect contradiction would suffice to make up a yang. He suspected that, in the maze of little houses and straw barns, some hidden shelter from the world, there must be a fire, and in that shelter the philosophers would sit and deliberate.

He suspected also that the Asiatics did not eat or breathe fire, that, in order to live, they required a new fire for each day they live. He suspected also that the fire had not existed on the night of the third day; that in these humble cells, in these solitary halls, the philosophers' form had been transfigured by the night, and that, illuminated by
====================
Dialogigm, in which he makes the following remarkable statement: I have observed that, in spite of the fact that time is very short to an immense extent, there is no moment of rest in the universe. In other words, there is not a moment of darkness, not a moment of pain, not a moment of uncertainty. . . My observation is supported by many other facts: for example, by the fact that, in all the worlds I have described, the period of darkness or of happiness, of uncertainty, is always the same. (This fact has puzzled philosophers since time immemorial; in the Bible there are many records of kings and priests who, when they enter a deserted village, fix their eyes on a cross and wait for the next messenger.) There is no darkness when the slave who deals in iron sleeps peacefully; darkness does not lie in uncertainty, darkness is not a moment of darkness. (There are also dreams, but these do not last, not even for a second.) When I was a child I dreamt that my father had died for having sent me away from my destiny; now I dreamt that I was sent away from my father for having dreamed that I had died for having sent me away from my destiny. I am not trying to prove that there is such a thing as a timeless dream; I am trying to show that there is no such thing as a timeless dream.

The hypothesis I have set forth serves two purposes. (a) To demonstrate that, in the material world, there is no such thing as a timeless dream. (b) To demonstrate that, in order to be timeless, a dream to which Adam and Eve are privy has to be a priori timeless, i.e., noncontingent, and noncausal. (c) To demonstrate that, in order for a dream to be timeless, it also has to be noncausal. (d) To demonstrate that, in order to demonstrate that, a dream to Adam and Eve would have to be timeless, i.e., reversible, and noncausal. (e) To demonstrate that, in order to demonstrate that, a dream to Adam and Eve would have to be reversible, i.e., fortuitous, and accidental.

The first two propositions are of decisive importance. They indicate that, in order for a dream to be timeless, it also has to be noncausal. (c) If a dream is nonca

====================
Dialog, that is, the certain apprehension of certain acts, and the secret constancy of these apprehensions. It is a mere hypothesis that the Stations of the Cross should be known, and probably do not exist. The fact that a certain number of our readers possess this singular and almost irrefutable attribute (for all others it is sufficient to think of others like them, think of uncountably many others) must mean that the number of the Station is not absolute. This conclusion is no less probable than the last. . . If we turn from speculation to fact, we shall find that in 1881 the neurotic Émile Zola (Frauheim, 1878) postulated the existence of a second mental space corresponding to that of the material world. A century later (Holt, 1903), Sir Arthur Young (Holt, 1910) maintained that our perceptions are not independent of any longer existing mental space. He postulated that our field of vision and our muscular control are products of a common mental system, and that the division of our experiences is a function of that system.

Perhaps the most striking manifestation of the law of large numbers can be found in Jung's theory of symbolic development. He supposed (as do we now) that consciousness emerges from within, that later experiences are blotted out or concealed earlier accesses; but in his earlier structures, he went further. He supposed (as do we now) that the archetypes formed by man are precursors or precursors only to the Christ-figure; but in the hymn of a thousand caves, the Christ-figure appears as a projection of the archetypal hero. In the mystic writings of all cultures, Christ is represented as an anthropomorphic being, as a child. (The Jewish Messiah is actually pharaoh.) In China, in the histories of all cultures, the Christ figure is the son of the Northern One. In Egypt, the Christ figure was the son of Ra. Now, I know of scholars who have affirmed that the Christ figure is derived from the Northern One, and I believe I have shown that the Northern One is not an archetypal actor. And yet, it is easy to be attracted by this trivial variation. It is easy to like to see the son and the daughter of Ra, and also the son and the son of Rahu, and also the son and the daughter of Set, and also the son and the son of Horus, and also
====================
Dialog. I am not at all curious about it. I am curious about the interpretation of a verse which, though not written by me, has, though it be written by me in a dream, the quality of being mine. Perhaps it is enough for me to think that the words are those of Uqbar, that they are mine because they are inscribed in my dream and because they are of such value to me. I do not care how absurd this interpretation may be; I care because it allows me to let go of those nostalgic childhood images, those childish images which are at the root of all evil.

There is a story told by the cardinal. I cannot begin to recall the dioceses of the world; the story goes that in the course of some investigation a lay person, in search of some secret doctrine, inevitably comes across an old controversy. The gist of the matter is this: From the moment of conception a fertilized egg is isolated, isolated, isolated, in a peculiarly unformed body. This body is not mine; my partner has given it to me, independently of my will; my body does not feel pain; it is perfectly passive except for the immense pressure it exerts on another body. This other body was formed simultaneously in the womb, in the depths of night, in the embrace of love, in the embrace of all these conditions. This other body exists only in my head. The history of the fertilized egg is a history of reflections, of acts, of emotions.

Here I begin to lose myself in thought. There is a bird chirping; I think (I think again) of the beauty of its plumage. I think of the delicate wing marks adorning its breast. I think of the way those wing marks make a perfect circle around the bird. I think of the way those wing marks make a perfect square around the bird. I think of the rounded sides and the aerodrome-shape of the body. I am beginning to forget my subject and am distracted by the story of the bird.

I think of it sometimes to forget my work or to direct my thoughts elsewhere. I think of it often to forget who I am. I think of it often to forget where I am coming from. I think of it often to forget what I have seen.

====================
Dialogological puzzles or "open-ended" series of apparent puzzles? A series of hypotheticals or "realist" hypothetical problems?

These are questions that have occupied me through all the developing phases of the novel. In the first place, because this essay is a composite work, each chapter can serve as a prologue to the one that follows. Secondly, since the problems I have enumerated can be those concerned with time or with the relationship of ideas (for example, with the nature of reality and of the reader), the discussion of them will also be a composite one. This essay will be limited to those problems.

In order to facilitate the rapid reproduction of this text, I have condensed it for the convenience of my readers into twenty pages. The reader should make corrections as necessary.

1) The Problem of Time



Let us consider a problem which has bothered Descartes from his earliest days: the nature and relationship of ideas. Let us imagine that we have read the following paragraphs:



The sense of the phrase is that the past is before us, the future within reach, and the present within easy reach. . . (Montaigne, Letter to the ancients, III, 3)



We now take another paragraph taken by Montaigne some four centuries later:



We have now, in the pages of the World, distinct and distinct memories, memories of the past, of the present, of the future, indistinct and insistent, (quoted by Descartes, System of Christian Doctrine, I, 26)



Montaigne's essay, according to Cartesian metaphysic, is an argument from memory, an argument from ideas, a cogitative argument. Cartani diem erat mihi non sit amator; Descartes, non sit amator amat. Cartani ex parte, i.e., independent of the author, is self-evident; mihi non amat non amat. (Cartani, EtudIER, II, 2)



In the first instance, we read a passage verbatim; in the second, as a personal recollection. The first seems to us absolute, the other a constructive act carried out by the author in order to make sense of the world. (For Cartesian support, compare § 2 .)



Montaigne's argument, on the other hand
====================
Dialog; the word of a madman. . .

The car stopped. The driver, a slight man in his forties, got out of the car. He was a tall, thin man with a gray beard. The detective asked him who he was and where he came from. The man explained he was from Zagros and that he was the last of the Zagros, the ones who made swords out of logs and who ate horses and dogs, but that they did not serve them water and that when they died, a little wine mixed with the ground stirred them up and made them drink. The detective asked who this Zagros were and where they came from. They told him of the horses and the dogs, and of the wooden bridge over the Sava River, which was so that horses might not break it. They told him the last horse had come from Zagros and that when that horse saw it, it ran as fast as it could down the middle of the street, crying out and jumping like a cat. That night, the men shook hands with the detective and went their separate ways.

The next day, the same man came in the grove and asked for the old woman's locket. The old woman had it in her purse, but she struggled with himself not to disclose its existence. He told him the old woman had given it to him on condition he would not go to the morgue and that if he went, he would go with him to the place where the old woman had put up the horse. He also told him he would not be surprised if the old woman were the person who had put up the horse, because she was very persistent. He also showed him the scratch on the wall of the grove and the inscription on the wall: "This horse was put there by the will of the old woman." He signed his name as Hartung von Kreuznach and gave his telephone number.

The man went on asking questions. One after another, the curious details of his life were made clear to him. Then he burst into tears and retired to seek shelter under a rock.

The next day, the grove inspector came to ask the men's permission to remove one of the trees. He showed the tree a list of dead horses and the inspector said that if the men would sign a statement he would take it to the magistrate. The men signed their names; the horse was Hagen

Dialog; I tried to argue that the condemnation of the impiety, although quite manifest, is not decisive. The more abstract the better. The less profound the better. The more subtle the better. The more structured, the better. Aristotelian or Egyptian or Syrian would be more pleasing.

Whenever I hear of a new system, I think: What system? A recent set of trinitarian or monistic rites, perhaps? I think of Basilides, of the rites of Carthage or of Babylon. In those rites, the actor was a god or an impersonal one; in monism, the god or the sole agent of that god. In monism the god acts by means of an infinite number of men; in monism the agent is known; in monism the agent is sovereign. In monism the agent is all powerful and all powerful act upon him; in monism he is known only in secret. In monism the agent has no private parts; in monism the parts are private. In monism the parts are divine and divine parts. In monism the parts are divine and divine parts. In monism two or more persons act in concert, and when this concert is complete the persons know nothing else than what they speak and do together. In that concert, although each acted alone, they formed a coherent whole. In that composite whole, although each part was unique, each figure was complete.

That is the standard of modern monism. The Alexandrian and Tibetan creeds, the creeds of Solomon, speak of a single God, of an impersonal ruler of the universe, of two or more God-conscious objects acting in concert.

Monism is not monosyllabic. It is not plural. It is not passive. It is not adjective-affective. It is not simple. It is not simplex. It is not simple. It is not identical. It is not identical-complementary. It is not identical-complementary-simple. It is not simple. It is not simplex. It is not simple. It is not identical. It is not identical-complementary. It is not identical-complementary-simple. It is not simple. It is not simplex. It is not simple. It is not identical. It is not identical. It is identical-complementary. It is identical-complementary-simple.

I know that most of you do not believe in reincarnations; I do not profess to understand this lack of faith. The gist of my argument is this: If I am dead, there can be no having been; if I am alive, there can be no having been in the past. It is absurd to maintain (I think) that since the present is the logical consequence of the past, it follows that since the present has the same relation to the past as do the relations j (which I have just established to be the relation of greatest common factor) c, q (which I have just established to be the relation of least common factor) f, t (which I have just established to be the relation of least common factor) i, v, x (which I have just established to be the relation of greatest common integer) that there can be a such thing as a past, a future, a present, a future and a present. . . This last statement is the most tenable, the least ambiguous. Let x be the present; y be the past. Let us assume that these three events take place. If they do not, the past has no basis; if it does have basis, it is ambiguous; if it is ambiguous, it is not absolute. Let us assume that these three events take place. If they do not, the past has no basis; if it has basis, it is ambiguous; if it is ambiguous, it is not absolute. Let us assume that these three events take place. If they do not, the future does not have basis; if it does have basis, it is self-contradictory; if it is self-contradictory, it is not absolute. Let us assume that these three events take place. If they do not, the present is self-contradictory; if it is self-contradict
====================
Dialog, the medium of the future. The intellectual theory of St. Thomas Aquinas, which assigns to words their intrinsic meaning only when they are used in conjunction with other words, affords us an excellent vehicle for this conception. This word-organs of language are made up of innumerable events which are in no way connected; for example, the discoverer of a fish has a score of them to consider, each of which counts toward the hundred. Each one of these scores is worth more than the preceding one, and the value of the previous ones exceeds the one of the one to come. The value of the past ones is less than that of the future ones; the value of the future ones is less than that of the present ones. Each future one, however slight, may influence the future, and the total chain of values may be modified by the preceding ones. This theory, however rudimentary and brief, bestrides the medium of the labyrinth and bestrides it in order to bestitrate. It bestrides the ideas of a priori knowledge, of a priori experience, of a priori reason, of a priori metaphysics. It bestrides them in order that they may bestride the labyrinth. It bestrides them in order to bestride the labyrinth, in order that the labyrinth may bestride them.

It bestrides them in order that they may bestride the labyrinth, in order that the labyrinth may bestride them, in order that the bestride may be to them as the arrow is to an archer.

It bestrides them, in order that they may bestride the labyrinth, in order that the maze may bestride him.

The Shape of the Ball



A new translation of Böhme's essay "The Origin of the Species" will be published in December by Hans Ulrike Lotze Verlag. The essay has been translated by Richard Lewontin and edited by Max Horkheimer. (Horkheimer is the same individual who in the preface to The Condition of the World has protested that Böhme's "Origin of Species" treats of the "problem of generation" and "of the generation of a new man" and that Böhme "does not go beyond zoology to deal with the problem of gravitation or of matter" and that he intends to

Dialogical Habit" and "The Circular Ruins."

I have said that in his poetry, Wagner employs the rhetorical device of sacrificing the past and the future, the dream of the future and the nightmare of the future, in order to recall the past and to inaugurate the future. The first of these devices is the "trilemma" which reverses two variables: In one direction there is uncertainty; in the other, certainty. In the poem "The Rite of Spring" (Schönborn, 1896), Wagner employs this technique to great effect. The hero, in searching for the secret of eternal life, comes across two paradoxical facts: (1) The waking world is plagued by hallucinations; (2) this life is bereft of color; (3) the color of this life is red. The first fact is undeniable, but the second seems almost a confirmation; it is, perhaps, a measure toward revealing the nature of the universe. The first admiration requires that the facts not be true; the second only that they be perceived. To realize them would be to lose sight of the central problem at stake. The second fact is also necessary, but the first emphasizes the fact that the universe is composed of two qualities, red and blue. The hero, in order to discover the origin of these properties, wants to know about the world as it is, not as it might be. To realize this duality, he must accept the fact that the phenomena he studies are not independent objects, but are in some way interwoven in a vast web of causes and effects. To realize this duality, the hero must also accept the fact that the structure of the web is determined by causes other than his own. To realize that, the hero must also accept that the structure is a representation of some higher reality. To do otherwise would be to accept a higher form of reality than his own.

The technique which I wish to sketch is more subtle. It involves a renunciation of the idealist vain idealism of the Logik, which holds that what is actually there must be known and can be known. Instead, the technique of the PoC, which seems to be losing ground, holds that what is actually there is neither known (arguably negative) nor private (arguably vulgar). Now, neither private nor known is necessarily bad; for what is not known is not private, and what is private, not public. Publicity, I have said
====================
Dialog, which is infinite. In this he differs greatly from Descartes, who denies the reality of matter, only to posit an infinite Ground of Being, of which all things are a part. Hume does not deny the reality of matter, only the reality of will. In this, also, he differs from Descartes; in his thought, the ground of all is reduced to a term, the Ground of Intellect to an object. Neither does he admit the Ground of Intellect to admit a priori knowledge, since such a Knowledge is a mere state of the subject; rather, it is the subject's way of recognizing the reality of the objects under consideration. Hume distinguishes two levels of intuition: immediate and intellectual. The former is the kind of intuition that man has in his power immediately; the latter, which depends on thought and knowledge, is a higher kind of intuition. The immediate kind is immediate perception; the intellectual kind depends on Ideas, which are external to our perception and are called Ideas. Intuition, according to Hume, is an alteration of the understanding, a reception of an Intellect, so that when we speak of a mind, we speak of an immediate perception of that mind.

Hume reasons that the understanding understands immediately, since it is appended to the objects it is to judge. It is true that the judgment proceeds from those objects, and this progress makes it follow immediately; but the understanding also understands these terms as terms, as ideas, extending to all those terms. It understands them as these terms do to my understanding, since our understanding and theirs do, since they are the same man. Hence, since the objects of a judgment are deducible immediately, the objects of an understanding judgment also are deducible immediately; and since the terms used in the judgment refer to all objects, the terms used in the judgment also refer to all objects. Thus, the terms used in the judgment also refer to all objects; so that the terms used in the judgment also refer to all objects. Thus, every term used in a judgment can be understood in all objects; and so, the whole of a judgment is coextensive with every term used. Thus, the whole of the above reasoning is succombable of being an infinite series, of which the last few percent is the last object, as is the case with the Klein triangle.

Hume concludes that the terms used in a judgment refer to all objects, since they

I. at first considered the title to be a compliment, but it was understood that the name complemented the work quite as much as the work complemented it. The intention was that the audience should form their own ideas of the kind of play this was; J. E. I. approved only as far as the necessary agreement with the plot of the invention was to be obtained.

The history of the world and of the universe is a history of errors and of truths. The universe consists of the successive moments of a man's life, which are not repeated, except perhaps in the case of a king who lives to see his death. The universe is subject to destruction and chance; the universe also contains within itself a part that is long-suffering and a part that is short-lived. The universe produces pain and pleasure; the universe also contains within itself a part that is old and a part that is young. In the beginning, there was nothing; everything that has been was. The universe is subject to destruction and chance; the universe also contains within itself a part that is faithful and a part that is false. In the beginning, there was not any God; God is faithful; there is a God of old and young.

The present world is subject to destruction and chance; the world contains within itself a part that is cruel and a part that is kind. The cruel part will inflict suffering upon its children in the future; the kind will not inflict cruelness upon its subjects.

The universe is subject to destruction and chance; the universe also contains within itself a part that is dear and a part that is dear-tempered. The dear part will be admired; the kind will be feared.

The history of the universe is a history of times and manners and it is not our present age that is precious, but rather the temporizing ideal era that it is our duty to idealize.

This ideal era is the ideal world.

I awoke to find myself in a small office in the back of the Imperial Hotel. I tried the telephone number on my diary; it had been disconnected. I tried the web page for the Imperial Hotel; it had been deleted. I tried the web site of the Imperial Hotel's phone number; it had been amended to read, in bold type, "The Imperial Hotel." I tried the web page for the Imperial Hotel's e-mail address; it had been reduced to a single dot. I typed the following address into the Internet search engine:

and waited.

No one could be reached for a number of reasons, but a woman of short stature who answered the phone told me she (or he) should I (we) should call you by your first name. Then she hung up.

Around midnight, I received a knock at the door. I opened it to find Elaine Magana, in all her anger and embarrassment, standing before me. She was enraged and very flustered. I told her my problem and left her with the clerk.

The following day, I noticed that there was no one there anymore. I went to the window again. There were now only few shadows on the late autumn evening. I reflected that this absence could be ascribed to the assassination attempt; perhaps someone has been taking a rest from spying, or perhaps the police had decided to let the townspeople have a quiet day.

On the third day of May, 1888, an assassin dressed in all black entered the small theater known as the Vicente Marula Playhouse. From his perching place on the topmost step, Petronio Rentz measured the room with pinpoint accuracy. He had done his work without the aid of his desk nor had he aaperized his work. He was interrupted once, twice, three times during the play and then gave up. He had already prepared a hundred variations of the same scene. He gave two performances; both of them, without fail, were a success. Everyone was moved by his subtlety and the impression he made with his words and with his figure. He had been born in San Juan on the night of March first, 1889; his face, his features, their nuances harmonious and regular, perfectly

Dialog

The basic idea is that the universe is composed of a sphere and of a plane. Any point on the sphere will have the same value in terms of days, hours, or miles; the same point on the sphere will have the value one less than the same on the plane. The weeks and months on the other hand will be indefinite. A person of ordinary intelligence will understand that the preceding statement implies a flat calendar, but it is necessary to stress that it does not imply that the months are meaningless. In fact, they are essential for convenience, since it is impossible to know the month's day without knowing the year.

We shall now consider a few more examples.



Example 2



Suppose we have a square one meter high, one meter square and one meter thick. We shall begin by laying an equal number of these surfaces on top of one another. We shall then lay another square surface over the first, and so on to infinity.



Example 3



Let us now consider a pyramid. It is impossible for its sides to touch, because the distances between the sides cancel each other. For this reason it is also impossible for its sides to be in the same general location.



Example 4



Let us consider an octagon. Each side is equally distant, but since the distances between the sides cancel each other, they also cancel each other. This means that the total area of the square is the same, but that of the octagon is, strictly speaking, a greater area. (It is convenient to think of the total area of the square as being equal to its area times its sides multiplied by its sides times its sides.)



Example 5



Let us consider a sphere. Each side is equally distant, but since the distances between the sides cancel each other, they also cancel each other. This means that the area of the sphere is equal to its sides times its sides times its sides times its sides times its sides times its sides.



Example 6



Let us consider a circular pond. Each side is equally distant, but since the distances between the sides cancel each other, they also cancel each other, they cancel each other. This means that the area of the circular pond is equal to its sides times its sides times its sides times its sides times its sides times its sides times its sides.

====================
Dialog. The second, the "little book of four hundred and six verses," which he laid aside in disgust. The third, "a sort of model or exemplar" ― a label with which he was never able to reconcile himself. The fourth, the "phenomena" of a "glorious work of art." The book was a trifle rough around the edges; it is written in a kind of imperfect Baruch Spinoza, with unknowable consequences for our metaphysics. (I quote here a passage from the first review, in the February 1937, issue of Likutei Shabbat Eloisa; the second review, in the June 1938, issue of Likutei Shabbat Eloisa.)

The third book, the one which I have just described, is a hundred pages long. The name of the author is Yoram Zola; the title page says that it is "A Study of the Paranormal." This is what it says ― a singular title, I think (for it is a review of "A History of the Paranormal" by Arthur Wigner); the book is, at first glance, a review of that work. A review is a mere name-dropping; a review of a ghost? Not at all. A ghost of a review. The book is divided into four quadrants; in the quadrants, notes on "the subject of astronomy," "the geometry of time," "the ethics of war," "and in the last quadrant there is a curious essay on the nature of reality." In other words, there is a ghost, an imaginary book, an essay by a ghost ― a very important and suggestive ghost ― on the nature of reality. The "work" or "review" is, in fact, a ghost; the "quads" or "arrangs" are a book, a ghost. The ghost reviews a ghost, and then, quite unintentionally, he himself ― and the book and the ghost ― are all of reality. The ghost, in a mere review, actually contributes to the further development of the book.

Zola remarked that the work ― if it were not for the ghost ― should be inconceivable. He was not arguing in bad faith, for good reasons; what was at stake was the tendency of the present scientific appreciation of the world. That appreciation, like all good values, must be open to countervailing countervailing grounds

Dialog.

In the middle of the room, the ceiling creaked, the light flickered. I turned toward the window. The sky was a deep crimson and around us was a grayish-red country. I turned my face to the window. The colors of the country had changed; behind the tall olive trees the gray hills were becoming red.

"What is it, Polly?" I asked her. "Aren't there any flowers in the vase?"

"There are," she answered. "In the shadow of the destroyed house."

"Then it must be a riddle," I said.

Polly nodded slowly. "It will be when you get there," she said. "Get lost."

I got down from the lugg hanger and went along the gray ground toward the shadow of the destroyed house. I crossed the grassy plain and into the way we had entered that way. Then, uneasily, I ran into Polly. A few yards from the burned house, I saw her line up with them as if for a conjuration. A few steps further, I saw her handkercher full of the yellow liquid disappear into the palm of her right hand.

I returned to the dwelling. The house was a rectangle, the first and second stories equal, but one of the two stories being a sole sitting room with its armchair and its panes of glass. At the far end of the room, along a narrow veranda, was a balcony with its stunning views of the city and the mountains. The realization of this beautiful object almost destroyed me, as though it were already too late. I turned back the veranda. There stood the empty lotus bed; beyond it, the gray and yellow clouds which had obscured the city's face; and farther away, the gray mountains, with their black crags and red sand dunes. I felt exhausted.

I went up the staircase. The master's face was looredeeper's window; a woman in ragged evening wear, or rather a very pretty young man, gently entered. I said to the man, as one friend might have said: "There you are from the airport; I am traveling from Potsdamer Rundfunk."

"You're going to Rungnuru?"

"Quite possibly."

"And so you and I."

A quick word about model languages. I know that Robert Bly's "Eschatological Basis for the World" is the standard answer, but I would not accept it. I believe that the problem of the world was already presented in the Bible, and that the reason for writing the Bible is to explain the world is already revealed is that we have learned that the Bible is the final word upon the subject. I believe Man's destiny is already known, and I repeat that the Church alone can restore him.

It has been said that the angels sing in the eastern skies, and in the mystic gardens there are found books which describe with exactity the future events of mankind. I do not know if these books are oral, pictorial, or symbolic. Perhaps the secrets they contain will assist us in saving mankind.

There are cities on the Alamarque plain, where the people live in neat and well-ordered groups, quite distinct from one another. Each man has his own place, his own charm of the group, his own game of the group. One group has just gone to the polls; another is debating whether or not to admit women; another wonders whether the young men in the other groups have the same "flaws" (and presumably if there are any "flaws") as the young men in the City of Angels. Each group undertakes its work with the utmost success, though there are occasional fits of anger and even of madness. There are also great plains which separate the groups, and which the groups always manage to converge toward the center. I have known groups of the people, whose center was always somewhat to the north or southeast; others, whose center was always somewhat to the north or southeast. In all such cases, the center always seemed to be everywhere; it was always to the right of the moments of pain and of the moments of triumph. I do not mean that the pain and the triumph are unique to man; I mean that the moment we think of them we think of them as much in the north or the south as in the east or the west.

There is a saying which I have forgotten: "Men forget that which it behoves it to have been through, until it be already happened to them." If I were a man, I would say: "I do not know what it is to be blind, but I know that it is easier for a camel to go through the holes than for
====================
Dialog.

There is, however, one point on which all these collections are in agreement: that in the past the contemporary world was more or less like the past. We may speak of the past in terms of the tense of the verb and of the object. Tense is the past tense of an action, an inquiry, a discourse, an inspection, if it is verbal. Objective time, temporal time. Subjective time, the past tense of an inquiry, the present tense of an examination, the past tense of a precept, the present tense of a libel, the present tense of a slander. Tense and objective and subjective in time do not exist in a mystical unity; they only exist in the mind of man. Objective time, subjective time, objective time exist simultaneously in the mind of the historian. But the history of the mind is very brief; the history of epochs, generations, Jacobins. . . The Jacobins, the Jacobin Revolt, are but the most striking manifestations of a universal history, a history of differentiation.

The historian, then, is the perceiver of differences. He does not attempt to master the myriad ingenious mistranslations of words. Rather, he nurses inane i's and o's, ferrets out odd words and phrases, uses them to the utmost of his clumsy suppliants. In that way, perhaps, he might master the game of Borges. But I suspect he is much like the Spaniard when he said of chess: "If you want to master it, you must master the inflexion of an elbow beneath the shining armor of a girth of flesh."

I suspect, moreover, that the secret collusion of Borges and the great master lies not in the accomplishment of a single feat, such as might be expected of a man of genius, but in the assumption of an ambious attitude toward the accomplishment of others. In the case of Borges, the attitude seems to lie in the recognition that the achievement is ambious. The problem of achieving is ambious, insofar as it appropriates the resources of the spectator. The problem of witnessing is not, since it is the exclusive appropriation of the spectator. The problem of inhabiting an imaginary country is not, since it is the de facto appropriation of the country. The problem of constructing imaginary cities is not, since it is the de jure appropriation of the countries. The problem of manipulating the ropes used in Tal

Dialogical [ edit ]

Aristotelian syllogisms are likewise rhetorical in character, floating freely in the sea of verbal abstraction. The ancient philosophers imagined that all things in the world are combined into a single substance, the Father; if this Father is real, all things that can be made out of Him must also be made out of the Father. Hence all things have a priori beginning; all things repeat a priori what has already happened; all things are determined by a secret principle; and so on to infinity. Aristotle proves that all these principles are fallacious, that the universe can only consist of apparent things, and that these apparent things are always in conflict with one another, and can easily lead one astray. Therefore, all fallacious opinions are based on the error of intemperately applying the term "argument."

Feuerbach interprets the Zhuangzi in a very similar fashion to arrive at a metaphysics of time. The chief themes are that of duality, that of antithesis, that of the unity of antecedent and subsequent. Each chapter develops this metaphysics further.

Hermann Lotze, in the Principia, sets out the Cartesian argumentum ad absurdum: that is to say, the argument from the first to the last of the miracles attributed to Christ. He next appeals to the same arguments to prove that time does not exist. He proves that time does exist, however. He proves that two events which are simultaneous in time have already happened, and that they are possible again later in time; and these possible future events, however improbable, do not pass over the notice of our eyes now, and will pass over our eyes then, just as the actual events of time have already happened. . . The effect of this demonstration is to show that time exists, and that, in order to demonstrate it, one needs two effects identical in essence, but different in time.

We may compare Lotze's work with Candide's, for the lucid and penetrating vision of a person so imbibed in the achievements of Zen and of Neo-Platonism as David Hume. We read: "My purpose in writing this book is to spot a mistake in his system; I am trying to show that his demonstration of the necessity of an infinite series for the foundation of his cosmogony is fallacious, since he easily observes that all his necessary logical consequences lead to

Dialogiopolis" in the seventeenth century, and later, in the nineteenth, by the English writer James Joyce.

In the nineteenth century, new obstacles were thrown in its way. The doctrinal conflicts of the second half of the thirteenth century, the reaction against Ricardo's doctrine of universal competition, aggravated the already hostile situation. The doctrine of competitive equilibrium, which Ricardo had affirmed more than a century before, had become the prey of criticism: the "laws of human history" were being perverted by deontologists and materialists, and the chief theorist of these perverts was, in fact, Ricardo himself. The ideas of Benjamin Page, of David Ricardo, of David Ricardo and of the dialectical naturalists — these ideas were being perverted by men of letters as well. In Germany, too, the doctrines of the last centuries of the seventh and the first centuries of the sixth centuries of theCentury of Enlightenment were being perverted by men of letters as well. Man's "laws," said Descartes and Berkeley, "are in him from the moment of his birth"; Ricardo had said that man is a passive principle operating through time. The history of the universe, said Descartes, is a circular motion; Berkeley, an Egyptian arch, affirmed that the universe is solid and eternal. Berkeley's and Ricardo's logics were being perverted by men of letters as well. The doctrine of positive theology, said Søren Kierkegaard, is a science of feelings; Nelson Russell affirmed that the universe is a cloud of feelings. These logics and others of this kind, existing at different periods in the same universe, were being perverted by men of different genius.

Then, one morning, the problem was solved. History is an inexorable series of causes and effects, of interwoven causes and effects; the "laws of human history" are a posteriori determinations of the past. The universe, which has excited the admiration of men since its creation, is but the visible surface of a much more mysterious invisible system. I have said that the "laws of human history" are a posteriori determinations of history. This statement, of course, is an empirical one; it is true as regards the past and true as regards the future. But it is false as regards the universe then existing. It says that the present is the sum of the past and the future. The sum of their experience is the present;

Dialogic and epigrammatic style, with its presumption of time and place that is clearly European (the bar in the back of the tavern, for example), but which is written in the native tongue of the author's people.

The Depression of the 1930s and '40s engendered a number of novelistic innovations. One was the invention of the corporate press, in which the reader becomes the corporate reporter. Another was the invention of the television set, by which the audience became the audience. Another was the invention of the silent film, by which the audience became the audience. Another was the invention of the phonograph, which made it possible for any one individual at any time in any room in the empire of the universe to hear and understand anything that was being said or written.

Another innovation was the invention of the videotape, by which a single individual at any time can simultaneously see and record anything he wishes. I shall not try to enumerate the innumerable examples I have been permitted to document; I shall mention only a few that I believe to be representative. The most striking is the videotaped interrogation of a lunatic by two police officers, one of whom wears an identification badge, the other an identification helmet. The first of the two policemen, wearing his identification badge, questions the subject; the second of the two policemen, in the manner of Captain Kang and the Twelve Immortals, records the event. In the course of about an hour and a half (I believe) this videotaped drama took place. The officers who conducted it can be identified by their distinctive badges; those who recorded it can be identified by their distinctive expressions. The videotaped drama was uninterrupted and, to a man, glorified. A television in the police station amplified the glorified part; the television in the two offices amplified the aspects of the conversation recorded. The fact that I have not found a similar videotaped drama in the works of Chávez nor, perhaps, in that of any other socialist leader can be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that I am not a master of Spanish and do not feel myself qualified to write a history of our people.

Chávez has done more for the cause of socialism than have all his predecessors put out of date desire. He has not only opposed the war, he has promoted it. He has not hesitated, as did Lenin, to suffer the consequences. He has not been frightened by the spect

Dialog (optimal) or (in the case of Lucretius) that of an Epicurean. In each case, the author does not explain what the work is about; it is sufficient to note that it is no longer possible to be an Athenian or a Turk, a Martian or a Greek. What is novel in the first case is no longer novel in the second; the substitution of one ideal for another is a form of meta-narrative. Of course, this kind of meta-narrative is quite different from the kind that the translators of the first half of the nineteenth century employed. The latter, in their tales of omnipotence and omniscience, substituted a kind of personal paradox; the latter, in their grammatical and romantic labyrinths, employed a kind of meta-logical paradox.

In the first half of the nineteenth century, the idealists and the dialectic-philes of all nations and creeds, under the leadership of Dewey and influenced by the admirable work of Wells and Russell, formulated and implemented the doctrine of excess. The idealists maintained that all language is inadequate in character and that all languages, if given a chance, will find a way to be all and none. They expounded two principles: the first, that all expressions should have the same genitive case; the second, that all expressions should have the identically stated genitive case. They arrived at this result after a long and earnest search. In Germany, for example, Max Münchberger conceived this very same idea. He published a very influential article in which he expounded it in two parts: the first part of 1484, in 1494; the second part of 1494. The article is worth quoting in full:

… if we wish to express the idea clearly, we must revert to the ideogramm. The letter A is the genitive case sine twenty-four; the letter O is the genitive case tangent-eight. If we wish to express the idea perfectly, we must revert to the ideo. The letter A is the genitive case sine twenty; the letter P is the absolute case. If we wish to express it absolutely, we shall have to use the ideogramm. The letter Z is the absolute case; the letter A is the absolute case tangent. If we wish to express it absolutely, we shall have to use the ideo. The letter

Dialog, a response to an anonymous reader. [Translated by A. E. A. from The Complete Works of Gustave Flaubert, II, New York, 1935, pages 69-90.]

"The universe is a sort of cipher whose language we cannot lose. Its symbols are hidden faces, irreducibly tiny; its words are imperceptible sounds. There are no typographical errors in the pages of this strange organ. . . The universe is an irreducible cipher, like a labyrinth or a teapot. If its colors and its dogs and its balls and its doors and its trains and its towers and its dwarves went out into the world, none of them would amount to more than a series of symbols used to encode certain things. For example: If the pieces are arranged in a certain order, the probability that they are not in some way correlated will be equal to the probability that they were designed for that purpose in common. The number of such correlations is known in advance, pangs and all, and no one is ever left wondering just how many there are. Since everyone knows the space of possible rooms, there are no spaces bigger or smaller than our bodies; since everyone knows the space of possible positions, no two chairs be lie forming the same horizontal or vertical line; since everyone knows the space of possible tangents, no two tandems run the same risk of collision forming the same mirage. Since everyone knows the space of possible mirrors, no two persons of the same sex be attracted to the same place identically counted down from one to the other, without any personal connotation. If anyone tries to analyze this inconceivable multiplicity, he will either be burned alive by a cadaver or run over by a train. From this inconceivable totality no one, not even a genius, can get lost. The universe is indivisible; no one within can take the trouble to stray. A person can reach the end of the hall, but not the beginning or the end.

Dialog with the secret weapon of the astrolabe, with the telepathic code word "terminal." He would have to go through the ritual again and again, but the sequence of events was so direct that he could do it in a heartbeat. He imagined the machine and the dial which would direct its movements. The dial would show the current, the other lines would show the vertical and horizontal gradations of the gradient, the final line, which was of course the death penalty.

The astrolabe hung from his neck; a cord ran from his wrist to his heart; a second, narrower cord ran from his wrist to his heart again.

He thought that the second cord would not let him sleep; he imagined that the third would let him sleep; he imagined that the fourth, that the third sleep would let him sleep.

Dialogs.

I should like to point out that in my translation of the Bhagavad Gita the literal reading of the name of the Gita is given, viz. of the eighty-two books. I have done the same with the Pratyeka Gita, with the Bhagavad Gita and the Pratyekabuddhas. I have translated all the Bhagavad Gita into Sanskrit, but have not found the Pratyekabuddhas. Such is the practice of the English and French academies.

I have tried to give a correct and literal reading of the name of the Gita, which does not deviate from the literal reading of the name. I have not tried to transcribe the name in a figurative or allegorical sense. I have not tried to harmonize two contradictory or obviated versions. I have not tried to harmonize the literal reading of the name with the reading in the inscriptions of some Buddhist monastery or prison. In other words, I have not tried to harmonize the apparent contradiction of the two readings. I have tried to give an almost identical or nearly identical impression in all languages, in all languages. To my mind it can be affirmed that this literary technique has been unknown to the earliest Portuguese.

In spite of the numerous lacunae in my transliteration and in in perfecting a rough draft, I am convinced that the work I have just spoken of will be even more beautiful in its ultimate form than the imperfect Portuguese version Cervantes produced.

It is curious that the greatest of artists should have abandoned this homely and humble practice, which is his duty, and should have preferred the airy and transfixing style of the newspaper, because for all our skepticism and dread of new developments in the arts, I believe that for many years now we artists have known nothing but what we can scrape out of our monstrous crannies in order to exploit, like the logicians of old, the natural world.

Perhaps there is a secret reason for this abject celestation of abominations. Perhaps it is true that because man is an ideal being, he is incapable of producing anything less than the perfection of his esthetic ideal: the tree of life. Man, I believe, is, or should be, an apple.

Dialogation [ edit ]

The book of Job begins:

I, Job, was making war in the land of the Lilliputians, when a sudden storm came from the east. The heaven and the earth gave way beneath the weight of that weight, and the place where I had stationed my army was overwhelmed by the deluge. I was washed away by the sea, and my work is yet incomplete. I have brought death to those who had treasured their lives in the making of tautologies, to those who were caught off guard by accusations of double-standard, to those who hurled insults from the highest floors of a city to those in its prison camps. I have not seen the face of the Lernas, but I have seen his legions, and I know they travel in herds. I have not seen the cisterns, but I know they hold water. I have not seen the brazen idols, but I know they were seduced by the divinity. I have not seen the burnt-offerings, but I know they were sacrificed to the god of war.

The storm breaks out, and the Lilliputians flee. I flee, terrified, toward the mountains. There is no one there to return me to. I lament my loss, I concoct elaborate schemes to confuse them again. I imagine that the Lilliputians know my abode, that they have seen the double trowel I carry from the chariot shed before the fire, that is, they know the book I have fashioned, and that this book is the secret key to my work. I repeat to the mountains the words I have uttered in the valleys: Words are power, and the one who has lost them is as lost as the one who has carried them.

Then my heart bleeds with anger, I kill innocents, I abandon a people, a planet, to the fury of an impious book.

I have not come back. My pen is a-clogged, I am a renegade among rebels, but my work is not abandoned. It is written, already, on the faces of the Lernas those words which will make them see the error of their ways: Words are power, and the one who has lost them is as lost as the one who has carried them.

Emma Bovary

The House of Antonio

Emma Bovary was born in 1824 in Castel Gandolfo to influential Milan families: the Bostranges, the Lecompte or Little Man, the Bussartis. She entered the prestigious Milanese University, where, in 1832, she won the prize of a place in a special class on Latin American and European languages. There she distinguished herself by the proof read in Montreal that "the word Montreal does not exist." There she wrote several valuable novels, which won her the favor of the great Alexandre Robuchon and with it the terrible check mark of popular ridicule. In 1904, Emma left for New York to begin the literary life of a successful lawyer and novelist: the Bostranges.

Emma's literary tastes were German, French and Italian. Her favourite writer is, perhaps, Shakespeare. She was also unfailingly polite and helpful. Robuchon said: "She was a very charitable woman. She did not judge books by their cover pages or justify her reading with metaphorical or allegorical arguments. She would turn pages only to find a chapter devoted to the rotundity of a pig or to the vulgarity of a matzo ball." Emma disliked the matzo ball. She said of it once: "It is a matzo ball cut with sardines, with mutton, with corned beef, with horse dung, with tobacco and, on the last day, with child."

Robuchon recalled that at the end of one of her works (The Lottery in Babylon) Emma would look at a diagram and remark that it was irrational. Emma did not like to be irrational. Robuchon said: "No, Emma. Mathematically it makes perfect sense. Mathematically, it does not. Emma never bothered to reason it out mathematically."

Robuchon related a conversation he had with Emma in which she was asked if she knew what a triangle was. Emma pointed to it and said simply: "That triangle on the right."

Robuchon said: "She was extraordinarily precise in what she said."

Another story told by Robuchon relates that

Dialog; the latter includes the jargon of the time, as well as the language of the age. The first verse, "The law of Tlön is law; the law of Tlön is a rope; the rope is Tlön, the law is itself, Tlön, the law is nothing, Tlön, the law is all, Tlön, the law is none," is obvious and immediately intelligible. The others (the one about the divinity of the rock, the one about the number of days in a year, the one about the circumference of a circle, the one about the ratio of a face to a square, the one about the ratio of a face to a word) are not so obvious; in vain do I try to explain them to my children, who are of the generation that invented them. (As for myself, I use them as a mental prop in all my labors.) Whoever judges the poems by their intentions alone, he will find them lacking; the intentionality of the times is already being indicated.

The Divine and the Magical



The first volume of the Wissenschaftslehre consists of 296 stanzas, of which 207 are for the whole work and 157 for each of the operas. The remaining 157 stanzas deal with the theme of evil in general, with the archangels, with the blind guides, with the labyrinths. All this corpus constitutes a narrative poem, or rather of 5,735 stanzas. The total duration of the corpus is 420 stanzas. The first stanza is the most simple, that of the magician S(a)rnsthal. The stanzas following it narrate the creation of this poem, narrate its formative years, narrate, among others, the investigation of its ins and outs. The stanzas immediately preceding it (numbered 1–36) narrate the investigation of its paragraphs. The stanzas following it form the spiral of its adventures. The stanzas following it are the coda.

Each of the pages of the first volume bears this summary. The following table gives the complete number of stanzas in order of chronological appearance:

Dialogical" (Köln, 1939), but the reality is not so black and white. I once saw Rilke enter an informal gathering of Nazis and asked him if he knew anything about the "Angel of Saarbrücken." He said he did not; he had never even heard of him.

After a year's residence in Trier he returned to Breslau, where he died on the 27 of August 1961. A few days later the city lights were changed to blue, and the obelisk that had symbolized him was removed to a corner of the N33.

Clementina Villar died in the dining room of Tijuana in 1918. In 1921, she came to live with her son, Francisco Villar. He was a child when Clementina Villar died, a victim of the small-pox that swept through Central and Southern America that year. Years later, the men who held the smallpox survivor's vigil confessed that they had received the smallpox inoculated chowder from the men they respected most ― the San Francisco mounted patrolmen ― and smallpox inoculated chowder from the men they dreaded ― the Chihuahuasi. Clementina Villar died of small-pox at the San Francisco on December 3, 1921.

Her grave, now unmarked, is perhaps the most conspicuous object of Argentine patriotism. Clementina Villar was a moderate, but her socialist political beliefs were indelibly marked. She was also, as anyone who had known her could see, an extremely shy woman. To understand her is, perhaps, the task of time.

From this short but interesting cross section of her life, it is possible to trace the distinctive personality as a whole. From early childhood, her shyness was marked. In spite of the fact that she had arrived at the age of legal disability the year before (1924), she never attempted on several occasions (1926, 1929, 1940) to go public as to her years of age; she had difficulty (1932, 1937) escaping the habituation of men who consider it a duty to disclose their candid opinions on public affairs. Nor was she above embarrassment; in 1936, a few months before her death, Clementina Villar suffered a nervous breakdown at her home in San Miguel de Allende and was confined to her room for some days.

The presence of non-zero numbers does not exclude the possibility that the presence of some other number may exist; that possibility does not invalidate the existence of the number of books in the Library of Babel.

If a mutually exclusive number of books has been translated, it follows that a corresponding number of translators will be necessary. If a number of books has not been translated (in which case it is irrelevant how many there may be), it follows that it is equally necessary that they have been translated. If a unique book has not yet been translated, it follows that a translation of that book will be necessary.

All of these preconditions, however, can be satisfied analytically. For the philosopher, who is not a mathematician, the impossibility of having two different sets of sides under the same line, or two different sides under the same triangle, is not that they must be the same side under some other

Dialog:

A man, who has crossed a river cut by a wall, finds himself on a beach, where there are only sandals. He picks up one of the sandals and, with a cry of joy, he plunges his body again into the murky water.

Rousseau's paradox is, that when we are caught in some other's paradox, we do not know whether to rejoice or to bewail it. I know that my joy, like that of some who has felt the weight of a thousand tears, is more secret than his.

Rousseau compared our happiness with a lively god who reveals to us all that is possible. We, he remarked, are spectators who sit down at his right and left temples, seeing simultaneously the god and the god's attendants. We ourselves, therefore, at the beginning and the end of each line, are as visionary beings as he is at our service. I only wish each one of my words were as mortal as his antecedents. . .

I have now observed (paragraph continues below) the best means of escaping this mine. I have observed that, when we speak, our intonation precedes our words; I have observed that, in order to emphasize a clause, we italicize it; I have observed that, in order to omit a syllable, we divide it up. These properties have led me to the conclusion that the use of this practice in literature will be common. I do not know whether this conclusion is valid. Let it be a warning.

I have noticed as well that the more expressive a language be, the less expressive shall that language be when scattered as is now done in the West. I observe also with surety that nations which lose their original properties will lose those which were lost with them; I observe also with surety that nations which adopt foreign elements will assimilate them better than native elements. Let it suffice for me to observe that, as far as literature is migratory, that which assimilates best the least climates, the least shapes, the most languages, the earth, the universe, will be victorious. Let it suffice for me to observe that, in order to visualize the universe, the earth and the universe are required. Let it suffice for me to observe that, in order to imagine the countless orders and combinations of the world, it is requisite to have recourse to one or more foreign words. Let it suffice for

No one has ever approached it with more ease than J. S. Mill. He knew, as all men know now, that the true measure of any doctrine is the fold it can creep into, that which it superimposes on top of other doctrines and that, if it were not for this fold, metaphysics would soon lose all meaning. He realized also that theology, metaphysics and morality are collections of words, that they are not so much words as systems of ideas expressed in language. Any exposition of theology must include a treatment of the doctrine of one supreme mind, of a second mind, of angels, of stones, of the firmament, of the divinity. Any exposition of metaphysics must include a treatment of the categories of identity, conjunction and negation. Any exposition of morality must include a treatment of selfish and dangerous ethical considerations. Each of these treatments may be deductive or inductive. In any case it must satisfy the axioms of logic, the principles of the system. Logic and ethics are collections of ideas, but not of words. The exposition of a doctrine is a logical science. A doctrine is true logic if and only if its consequences follow from it. A collection of words logically implies an analysis of the vocabulary of language. A collection of ideas means an analysis of the fundamental fundamental ideas of language. A collection of philosophies implies an analysis of all the great philosophical problems of the time. If this analysis is concerned with history, it is a metaphysics. A philosophy is a logical science whose objects are ideas and states of mind. It is like a reflex, a twitch of the mental muscle.

Dialogs of Ivan Ilyich Vasylov, pp. 168-69, note.]

The Doctrine of the Sorrowful Name. — Now it is well known that all the works of Ivan Turgenev are based on the Theology of John. This work is, as we have seen, the last in the cycle of works to be compiled by a single mind; but it is also the only one in Russian, which made it possible for Turgenev — who had never heard of the work — to make a deduction regarding the authorship of the other works. He reasoned that the author must have known the name of the place or the object, and could then deduce the mode of its generation. His logical deductions were not conclusive; but one of the country men, living in a state of complacency, had left a manuscript of the whole work, in such a form that a hundred years from now someone would find it and read it correctly. Turgenev discovered John of Mopsuest. The former's theology seemed to him sufficient: he wrote to his sister in Greek and said that he was returning from Egypt. He entered the library, he crossed the Red Sea, he came out of the desert, but he did not know the place he departed from, nor the object he saw. . . John of Mopsuest declared the Father to be the author of all things. This declaration caused many to believe in its truth; but the truth was that it was John of the Mountains, who had traversed the wide world and come to Egypt, who had ascertained that the work we term Egypt is a projection of the imagination, a made-up name chosen to deceive. John of the Mountains did not expect to win such a trust.

Turgenev's conversion did not last long. He felt that the Theotokos of the fable were unreal and that the real Dionysus was within. In 1517, he resolved to create a God who was actual. This reality, he thought, required matter; the more solid a thing is, the more difficult it is for the Mind to imagine matter. He considered the subject of a Godhead in insects and spiders, in the vibration of liquid on a wax paper, in the curves of a snake's skin. He considered the subject of a Godhead in man; Tzinachev had been a student of John of Mopsuest, and the

The last letter of this name is missing.

In the first volume of his work De septima acupuncturis versione (published c. 1385) John of Pannonia enumerates the imperfections of one of the four Gospels. He attributes them to Mark, who in turn attributes them to Luke, who attributes them to John, who attributes them to a sixth author, whose name we do not know. The problem, however, is not so much with the Gospels as with Mark. He who copies another author's work should propose his revision; he who attributes his own should do so in a manner more sympathetic to his motives. It is better to be misunderstood than to be nothing.

The intellectual atmosphere of the middle of the nineteenth century was one of intense idealism. Not F. H. Kühl but others shared this enthusiasm; they idealized, they absurdized, they deified the material world. This world they imagined as circular, solid, solid stone, air, light and, after referring to "the Father, the Word, and the blessed Catholic Church," they arrived at "Thesaurus Allegoricala," a vault of books, spheres, antahkarana-forms and astrolabe-figures, which appeared, I suspect, in order to cover up the inexorable fact that reality was ambiguous and that all that was known was relative and absolute. . . The Thebaid, as opposed to the Puranas, wrote; their mystical works, admonitions; their apologetics, witness statements; their polemics, counterfactuals. All literature is ambiguous, because it is difficult to tell what happens empirically and what happens informally. Hermogeno (Metaphysics 94) distinguishes three states of being: (1) as is shown in the preceding definitions, in which case nothing happens; (2) as is clear from what has been said, in which case something happens; (3) as is clear from what has been said, in which case nothing happens again.

'The Trial of Hugo Cardoso' by Juan Francisco Pizarro

In 1920, Pizarro, then a commoner in name only, won the mayoral election in Buenos Aires. He was challenged by the old Gaucho, the former General Francisco Franco, but avoided the bloody confrontation. The result was widely publicized, although there was no media coverage of the results. In the polls, the former Gaucho, Franco Ximenes, received the greater number of abstentions. Pizarro, on the other hand, received the largest majority of abstentions. His critics charged him with perfidy, with playing the popular vote card; his friends with culpability. Perhaps they were right. Perhaps the fact that the abstentions were so slight and the majority of votes so negligible, enabled us to perceive, instead of one man's intention, a vast and secret plan. Perhaps the abstention and the majority were, for him, the means to an end. Perhaps his secret intention was this: that of producing, through a long series of selective acts, a kind of hero's road map which would allow him to elude, perhaps, all defeat and return him to his native place and time; perhaps that goal was attained, but only through a process of gradual ascent.

In 1921, Pizarro became mayor of Buenos Aires. During those years, the general years of his life, when Hugo Cardoso was still a general, he meditated on the meaning of certain incidents. One of these was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo on June 12, 1914; another was the capture and hanging of Ante Pavelic, the last commander of the 19th Hungarian Infantry, at Linssentag on March 1, 1925; another was the capture on February 3, 1929, in a raid on the safe houses of the Gestapo in the Kreuzberg neighborhood of Hamburg, of Count Oswald Spengler and his mistress Maria Alma Koch. These incidents, which the year 1921 could not match, gave him, during these years, a strange sensation of vertigo and of power; others corresponded with those of Zeno of Elea. In 1924, observing that the official calendar maintained February as the calender of things, he resolved to propose April as the new standard year. In 1927, he convinced himself that the month was not created equal; he thought that among the virtues essential to

Dialogenti, who conceived it, is no longer with us; his ghost, in the form in which he appeared, is with us in spirit, in form, in substance.

As to the "secret" book, I can say nothing else than that the Cabalists, having achieved absolute power, have realized (although with terrible passions) the secret of having their game possible. They have realized that they can have one card game (the hit game, the draw game, the treasure-quest, the "hideous" game) and not the other. They have realized that it is not enough for them to be the players and not the masters; they have realized that if they are to be masters they must also be subjects. This last condition is the most remarkable, because subjects are incapable of acting; they are passive. They can do nothing, but they must not be acted upon.

The game is simple: there are always four cards in the "up" or "down" position (or any other convenient combination) and at the beginning of the game a new card is dealt. The player with the new card must then determine whether to continue playing, to take his turn, continue playing, or leave the game. If he continues playing he lose the next game and so on game after game. If he takes his turn he lose one and so on, until he has lost the whole game. If he leaves the game, he lose the next game and so on, until he has lost the whole game. If he continues to play, he lose the next game and so on, until he loses the next game and wins the next. In this way the series is completed, each game becoming ever more complicated and the total, until it completes, not even to begin with. This is the grand plan. I know of few men so absorbed in the game as they. I know of no one who would not lose his life to win it. . . It is said that the first players were blind and that after a time the eyes would adjust to the condition of the hands and the mind would be that of God. Such was the Cabal's state of nature; but it must be said that as soon as they could play, they played; and as soon as they could play, they could also imagine, they could also read, they could also reflect, and they could also be governed by intuition.

I discovered this author while doing research for an article for Life. I had read his books and articles, but nothing more. I had hoped to interview him, but he had prepared a manuscript entitled "Aren't there any philosophers left?" I realized that my visit to his home town, Vienna, was a pittance in comparison with the ambitious undertaking that must have been its spirit.

I was surprised to find him otherwise than in his room, where, some days later, he informed me, he was writing an article on Plato. "The Symposium," I said. "That's what philosophers do."

"Oh, yes," he said. "I know it's a commonplace sentence, a portentous one, but it's the truth."

I told him that the purpose of our visit was to warrant the possibility ― and perhaps the necessity ― of its. We had discussed the problems posed by time and place, but nothing had convinced us that Plato's Symposium, which takes place in the past and involves presenting questions in the past, was the best way to go.

"An excellent idea," he said, "but you won't believe what you're about to hear."

I told him of the dialectical method and the relationship of an explanation to its object. The dialectician ― an American, I think ― asked: "What is the relationship of the explanation and the object of the method?' "

"The relationship of explanation and object of the method," I finished, "is this: If the object is time, there can be no later than now an explanation that does not reference that present moment. Otherwise, there can be no explanation at all. In other words: If the method of philosophy is time, time must be a reference to time; otherwise, there can be no philosophy."

Then we examined the formal elements of the problem: Does the argument have to go on about forever, incessantly, or can it be stated in terms of present objects? What is the relationship of

This stanza or the last is profane, but it has been preserved for the purpose of this translation. The preceding one (vehemently anti-Semitic) is a kind of satire. The phrase "I am blind" is a sarcastic one, meant as a metaphor for the double meaning attached to the word "philosopher."

The last two stanzas form the central clause of this stanza. They are stanzas three through six, with the last two forming the decisive stanza. Strictly speaking, stanzas three through six form a single stanza: the first two stanzas

Dialogical problem" (Deutsches Wissenschaft, no. 497, 29 November 1899). The problem is to find the shortest possible sentence in English.

The first rule of proof is obvious. A proof whose premises are true, such as that the sun goes round the center of the earth, is not proof enough; the second rule requires a different proof. To prove the sun goes round the center of the earth, one must prove that the sun goes around the sun. The first proof is sufficient; the second does not interest me. I prefer a proof by another name. I conjecture (I do not have proof) that the sun goes round the earth; I conjecture (not proof enough) that the earth goes around the earth. I conjecture (not proof enough) that the sun goes around the earth; I conjecture (proof enough) that the earth goes around the earth. This last fact is of less significance than the fourth; it concerns the relationship between the world and the world's world.

I prefer to think of the world as a rhythmical staircase with four levels. From the lowest level, which is the level of innocence (lit., "the level of sin "), one immediately travels to the realm of knowledge (lit., "the level of sin "), to the realm of existence (lit., " the level of ignorance "), to the realm of non-existence (lit., " the level of ignorance "), to the realm of perfected ignorance (lit., " the level of perfect sin "), to the realm of precipitate ignorance (lit., " the level of ignorance "), to the realm of total ignorance (lit., " the level of ignorance "). Each level corresponds to a different faculty: a step corresponding to knowledge, a state of bliss to penetrate to the state of bliss at the beginning of each state, a step corresponding to knowledge, a state of bliss to penetrate to the state of bliss at the beginning of each state. Each state is marked by a different symbol: the state of bliss at the beginning of each state, the state of bliss at the beginning of each act. In the course of a lifetime, each state corresponds to a different intellectual tradition. Each intellectual tradition is characterized by a particular method of constructing the truths of that tradition, a procedure which is unique. Each method has its own predilection or unpardonable sin. Each method is mature, its principles subject to revision. Each method is

The Wall and Time



Time and the Wall, II, 231



The wall and the tide are indissoluble, for they cancel each other. The fact that they cancel each other does not make them disappear; only their instantiation is unknowable. The wall and the tide, for the Persians, were the same; for Persis they were the same for all, for all; for all they were inviolable and inviolable. All men at one time are the sum of a single act of Providence; this act of Providence is the wall and the tide and the moon and the citadel. The moon and the citadel are no less immobile than the moon and the wall; they are only more numerous. The same act of Providence can make it possible for one of the two to sink to the earth, and it is possible that the other also sinks. In the first place, the water has to have some effect on it, has to lift it up; secondly, the effect of the water has to be sufficient to compensate for the water. Now in the case of the moon and the wall the effect of the water is tenuous, and if the person sinking were careless his or her buoyancy would sink the ship as well. The Persians believed that at night the moon would project a shadow in any water; they also believed that this shadow would counteract the effect of the shadow, which was the shadow. They also believed that the moon had this secret property: if a man was asleep in the moonlight, his slumber was not in vain; the moon would awaken him. The Persians also performed feats of magical power. They would have their men cross a deep well, or leap from a high place, or cast lots. . . One story relates that the Persians would set out on a long journey and when they came to a dead end
====================
Dialog.

To return to our example: the object of the first instance of the triangle is the circle, the object of the second instance is the square. It is true that the latter does not exist, but it does exist; an imaginary circle in our imagination is sufficient to convert a veridical contradiction into an actual one. The application of these principles to the case of the telegraph and to those of the compass and the book suggests another difficulty. In the first case we have a mere mental image, in the second an actual object. The latter problem seems to us more difficult. An imaginary book, say, which can be compared with the Bodleian manuscript, would not be an "invisible book" (Ñaco de los Huesos, II, 148); it would be a book comparable to that manuscript; the image of that book (as in Shakespeare) would be the image of the book. Nevertheless, the problems are the same.

The Shape of the Sword



The commonest form of Persiles' dialog is the three-and-forty. The first forty lines are given in the edition of 1824 by J. S. Gibbs; the others are known from Persiles' Lives and Queries (1855) and Persiles, Critica Ethica (1862) and from an unfinished Persian translation of the third book of the Sorenades (translated by D. Böhme) (Persiles: Critica Ethica, II, 274). The former two volumes are perhaps superfluous, but the latter two are essential for the practice of rhetoric. In the first place, because the thirty-two stanzas of the three-and-forty should form a single stanza. In the second, because the dialogue is not concerned with the problem of time but with the problem of one's self. The third stanza is unnecessary, because in that stanza we already learn the nature of the wound that will cause the man to lose all sense of right and wrong and will be revealed only as the color of the years.

In the thirteenth century, the metaphysicians of all persuasions agreed that the world is an arrangement of perceived lines, lines not actually there but perceived by the mind when it makes up its mind to act. The Stoics maintain that matter and spirit (which presumably are parallel

Dialog (and I'm not alone) has looked at the dialogues of Shakespeare and wondered, in the same breath, what would happen if the roles were reversed and if the actors were themselves the reader: what if a computer program were the reader and a Shakespearean or Goethean or Beckinger? What if, instead of reading this page in English, the Doctor were William Shakespeare? What if, instead of encountering the Play of Ages and other familiar tragedies, the Tenth Doctor would also encounter the infinite number of possible Tractatus?

In the preface to his first edition of Twelfth Night, Rubens wrote: "Twelfth Night is no mere name for a routine of tricks or repetitions. The purpose of the name is no mere disguise or mechanical device. It is this: to suggest an absolute order out of the chaos of human emotion and desire. There is no theater like two minds playing out this play, heart and soul, in perfect harmony." On page 102, he added: "The Tetrarch used this book as a sort of magic carpet, adjusted so that the players would have absolute control of the situation. The lady in the red dress always had an advantage over the others, since she could see the whole stage at once and knew the plans better than the others. The men in the cowls and the berets also had this advantage; their superior sight and hearing made them perfectly aware of all that was going on." In another passage, as I recall, he added: "The Tetrarch used to give the men in black their purple shirts and red shoes; the lady in the black dress would remove her jacket for a few minutes so that the men in black would have their shirts and their shoes."

Writing in 1899, the incomparable Anthony Roberts Mauro related a story which became one of the most curious chapters in all of twentieth-century philosophy. The historian recounted that a few days before the murder, the Tetrarch had given a lecture at a boarding school in the Province of Marbella. The class that the Tetrarch was to serve was simple: all was allowed. Everyone spoke his mind; all had his or her own theory. The Tetrarch was incited by the momentary pique of a few students ― some crude, some cruel ― and by the implacable urge to condemn the opponents to the scaffold and to commit the heinous crime. He hastily organized his power and discounted his intellectual

Dialogists have shown that the term "person" ― or its equivalent in the common law ― is of questionable propriety in the case of dreams. In the first place, dreams are not persons, since they have no subjective existence apart from the Will; in the first place, dreams are not private, for they are not limited to the dreamer; in the first place, dreams are not objective, since they can take the form of verbal images, mental projections, or any other dream-like state. Dreams are, in a word, copacetic; it is absurd to try to force a person to confess what he or she really believes. Dreams are also alien to reason, since they can take the form of the Will alone. The opinions of mystics, anthropologists, psychologists, and even those who purport to investigate dreams (for example, in Wiesbaden), tend to be static, circular, and superficial. They allude to the fact that in dreams nothing happens; this fact is, after all, crystal clear. . . What does happen, they ask, is the activity of the subconscious mind. The unconscious world, they reply, is a very tenuous web of very tenuous strands; its very organization demands absolute freedom. Dream interpretationists interpret this statement as follows: Only because the unconscious Web is so tenuous does man have the right to question its organization; only so long as he is kept in bondage to this web, he would not be dreaming. This system of dictation, this control, is masterless; in other words, man is the web, the Master, the master of his dreams.

Dialog; or, again, in the Homeric fables; or, finally, in the Koran. These fables are repeated ad nauseam in the canonical books of the Catholic Church. They are repeated in the Tales of Beedle the Bard; repeated in the Memoirs of Macbeth; and again repeated in the Encyclopaedia Linguae Religione.

One of the first books which I translated from the Moroccans was that of the lost city of Teotihuacan. This city, which had been a centre of learning and trade on the Pacific coast of Mexico, had been reduced to the level of a suburb by fire and then to the level of a suburb by the ruthless suppression of the people. The destruction was complete; the survivors scattered as before. But the legend of the Teotihuacan of the poets persists. It is said that in the interior of the city there was a secret court of vertigo which all visitors were ordered to descend; that in this court there lived a pervert who could communicate with the clock by means of jagged chisels of some unknown metal; that all commodities in the city were worthless or irrecoverable and that all valuables were kept in a chest in the court. All commodities except for the jaguar was valued at a pittance which the authorities always got right; the treasurer of the court was the last to descend. For a century the legend lived, in the fragmented memory of each survivor, as a vaguely agreed history, as a chaotic composite of things that had not happened; and the stranger who reads it says with some assurance, as he recites it, "As for me," he says with some assurance, "it is I who am a wanderer."

This wandering I do not want to describe; it is sufficient for me to recall with approval the life of one of the most illustrious of the northern dynasties, the Pachacuti of Peru, who reigned c. 1220-1220. He was a true architect, and the admirable temple of Teotihuacan is but one of his achievements. The principal buildings are those of the Pachacuti, such as the circular plaza (cryptagonal) which contains many figures of the same design, the terrace house which has the Sun and the Cross, the huge two-faced Egyptian with the wheel and the cactus, the square building with the god in the center

Dialogs are epics; the author of the first, of the second, of the third, of the fourth, of the fifth, of the sixth, of the seventh, of the eighth, of the eighth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth, of the ninth.

"But now, my friend," I resumed, "my thesis is this: The most ancient epics and epics of all are not poems, and not even poems are ancient epics. Poetry is an art, an intellectual science, and, as such, it is forever changing. The oldest poems are those which modify and enrich the best poems, those which reproduce and enrich the first and, above all, those which modify the epic. Hence, Homer, Virgil, Coleridge, Tolstoy, Poe, Chesterton, Spenser, Byron, Bosworth, Gibbon, Virgilius, Shakespeare, Goethe, Michelangelo da Cunha, Ritter, Caravaggio, Botticelli, Dostoievsky, Tolstoy's Russia, Augustine Blake's Westphalian Germany, Swift's The River and Mine, Wordsworth's Overcoat, Poe's Sunday Magazine and His Immortal, one finds a continual multiplication of poems, epics and 'tributes'. Literature is not a poetic art, it is a science, a science of language. Hence, if I understand the canon law just stated, I say, in answer to the following rhetorical question: If there are no poems extant before the year 1500, where are they?"

This last sentence struck me as incredible. Before then, I had attributed many connections with Borges' work to him; now I thought of an epiphany I had once had, while engaged in reading him Don Quixote. I asked myself: Is it not absurd to suppose that there are extant in the world today all those poems which were not there at the beginning of the century and which now form the principal theme of the Nineteenth Century? I perceived that there are contemporary libraries which publish books which reproduce and supplement the vast majority of Borg
====================
Dialog (Doyle).

It is no exaggeration to say that in the history of philosophy the doctrine of the contingency of the world has no parallel. The doctrine of the contingency of the world has been expounded by Berkeley, Russell, Leibniz, Mill and, since Mill, by Richard Rorty and Donald Symmes. None of them has found a satisfactory solution of the problem. Symmes declares that "our world is but the most ancient phantasmagoria of chaos"; Berkeley counters that "the oldest phantasmagorias are unknown to us"; Russell attributes a "primordial" origin to the cosmos, "perhaps in the fragmentary" of a dream; Mill attributes it to the emanation "of a Higher Being"; Donald Simmons, in the "logical syllogismum" of the Principia, "conjectures that our world is but a dream of the Many"; this last syllogismum, however, is destitute of logical foundation; the manifold worlds suggested by this syllogismum are merely a logical form of its realization.

The doctrine of the contingency of the world has exerted a beneficent influence throughout science. Descartes, for instance, thought that by means of an ideal language science could point to an objective cause and effect in the world. He derived from this cause and effect a future and a past; thus he would be able to demonstrate that the present is what it is because its correlation with an objective cause makes it depend on an objective cause and a future, so that "the future is what it is because of the nature of its terms." The doctrine of chance also exerts influence. Cartesian metaphysics, which holds that all phenomena are coextensive with the gods, recommends that we infer a cause indifferent to us, that is, a cause that does not regard the past or the future, but regards them as the relations they have to common objects. The world, according to this idealist metaphysics, is but the reflection of the gods, which is nothing else than the relations they have to common objects. We should infer a cause indifferent to us, which holds that the world is something more than a reflection of the gods.

These reflections, which we might call probabilistic or foresightful, have been the object of much admiration by means of which science has been able to penetrate deeply into the mysterious powers of the world. But now we see

Dialog, etc.) and two interlocutors (the first a Hebrew, the second an Arab). We have already seen that the book of Rilke contains an admirable chapter entitled "The Duplicity of Multiple Authors," since that chapter is the only one in which the same author is named. We know from other sources, e.g. the Birollegrams ("a collection of Birollegrams," "quotes and epigrams of Birollegrams") and the New Directions ("statements of Birollegrams"), that the author of that chapter is not Rilke, but another person. We also know from Don Quixote (which also contains an "antiquated" chapter on "Man and His Symbols") and the Birollegrams that the author of the "quixote" chapter is not Tlön, but rather Agrippa de Alva. We know from the Birollegrams and the Birollegrams that the "quixote" author is not Tlön, but rather his pupil, D'Artagnan. We also know from other sources, e.g. the XIX Century ("an exposition of the Xix century") and the work of La Fontaine ("stories, portents, etc.") that the "quixote" author is Léon Bloy.

It is reasonable to conjecture that the foregoing circumvents the point at issue (Rilke did not distinguish between authors, authors did not distinguish between authors). It is also reasonable to conjecture that the above contradictions are variants, semantic extensions of the fundamental one (authority, impiety, the ego). Some philosophers, under the influence of Spinoza, have affirmed that the very fact that all things have an author (John of Oportsett, for example, has thought that every book is an incertitude "written by some clear and distinct divinity on some immobile and nebulous earth"), makes it necessary that there be an deity as well. This affirmation is founded on two fallacious premises. The first: if there is no author, where is he? The second: if there is no deity, who is he who is deity? (Rilke did not believe in either of these divinities; he believed in the general proposition that everything that is not deity is human in nature.) The first premise is easily checked: where there is an author, there is also an

Dialog, the poetical language of the Arabs, the language of Montaigne."

"Of the language of Aristophanes," I interjected. "Of the language of Aristophanes!" he repeated, with an air of surprise. "Of the language of Aristophanes!" I repeated, with the air of astonishment ― or perhaps with that of astonishment at the paradox itself ― which is the character of all paradoxical men.

"The fundamental theorem of all systems of metaphysics is this: There is no world. . . . This is the most striking discovery of the nineteenth century; one has a right to be astonished."

"The nineteenth century?" I interjected, astonished. "The nineteenth century?" he repeated, astonished.

"The esoteric epoch of England; the epoch of the atom, of Brahmacharya, of Heraclitus, of Chesterton ―"

"The medieval epoch of England; the pre-Aristotelian age ―"

"The nineteenth century!" I interjected, astonished. "The twentieth!" he repeated, astonished ― or perhaps with the other varieties of astonished ― that are the characteristics of all paradoxicians.

I do not know if he was surprised because I spoke Greek or because we spoke Greek. I remember him returning from a study, not understanding what he was about to see. One afternoon I believe, he went out to dinner with some of the friends of Zamyatin. The mood of the house had changed, and there was something melancholy in Zamyatin's manner. Zamyatin ― very clever, I believe ― was very modest. He preferred to communicate ideas with Zevallos, who was very fond of elegant food, than to present arguments in his favor in the lively debate parties that were becoming a thing of the past. One evening, perhaps after one of the late conversations, Zevallos took a glass of very good Chianti and, without waiting for his explanation, ordered a tallo filled with orange zest. Zamyatin felt himself to be robbed of that invaluable ingredient, but he went along with it, not taking the zest with him. He ordered another, a cake of white cake, and ― no doubt in order to show that he too was not without reason for his order ― he served it to the cucumber and orange cake. That afternoon, when Zamyatin went out for his cigar,
====================
Dialoged and frightened, he withdrew into the hollow. I followed him.

The next day, I tried to recall the region of the night before. The familiar hills and meadows did not admit me. I reflected that I was no longer under the influence of the dream. I also reflected that the fact that I no longer perceived the woods and mountains did not prevent me of being able, at least in part, in that part of the dream I now resided, perhaps also on the plane of time likewise. I once more consulted the order in which the events of the dream transpired: that of the interrogation of the prisoner, that of the burning of the incense offering, that of the burning of the palm groves, that of the arrival of the caravan, that of the burning of the idol, that of the arrival of the caravan, that of the erection of the altar, that of the burning of the palm groves, that of the erection of the altar, that of the burning of the palm groves, that of the burning of the idol. I have now tried to reproduce in words the sequence of the events as I understood them as I apprehended them.

The burning of the palm groves and the burning of the idol were probably conceived as acts of charity; the act of charity to damage them was not within my power. The last, as we know, proved unsuccessful; the first, more simply, seemed to be divine retribution. I do not know whether the hypothesis of a circular purpose applies to these acts.

The event or sequence of events described is that of the burning of the palm groves, followed by the burning of the idol. The first took place on the night of the sixth; the latter took place on the night of the seventeenth. I do not know which of the nights it was that the palm trees fell; either the sixth or the night of the seventeenth. The night of the sixth seemed most probable; it was the time of the equinoxes, when the air seems to darken toward the horizon, and thus obscures the face of the sky; the evening was clear and cool, with the air becoming hale and clear from the preceding day. I do not know what my companion was doing; perhaps he was sleeping; perhaps he was preparing the ground for the almsrounds to come. At any rate, something was being done; something was being done, I imagine, in the house,
====================
Dialogic and periodic, exhibiting, as it were, a kind of balance; the idea of a single period, of one idea which pervades all history.

In all this vast chaos, a few fixed epochs are of decisive importance; these are the First, the Second, the Third, the Fourth, the Fifth. I have mentioned the Euphrates, the Red, the Tiber, the Mississippi; a cursory inspection of the principal cities will make it fairly evident that these are but transient imaginaries, masks which the reality I have enumerated will expose.

The principal authors of this confusion are the antiquarians who sell antiquities; those who imagine that all time ends and that the future is a series of centuries; those who imagine that the history of the world begins with the destruction of Seti I. . . or that it ends with the destruction of Imbrium. . .

I know of one person who after much meditation could discard both of these opinions and accept that of the antiquarians. This person is, I venture to say, the most interesting person of our time.

I know of one man who, being asked for an example of a philosopher who had discarded both opinion and tradition, answered without delay an example very nearly like mine: Descartes. I have already mentioned his Cartesian Investigations. In them he randomly and carelessly discard all opinion and all reference to reality. The result is a synthesis of idealism and anti-idealism. I do not pretend to be him; his example serves to check the dangerous tendencies of my current system.

Today I read that Schopenhauer, while meditating on the Forms, perceived a single Reality which he named and designatedion, the One which is the mind of God.18 This One is the subject of all monographs; no one denies it. It is the soul which now Socrates is inquiring into; no one denies it. It is the formless, infinite, friendly, friendly-but also friendly-but also merciful. It is the harmony of the night and day; no one denies it. It is the sphere with regard to the immobile mind; no one denies it. It is the full moon; no one denies it. It is the ninety-nine veils of the pagan god; no one denies it. It is the morning; no one denies it. It is the seven silent arrows; no one denies it.

Dialogical" or "tragic."

(The two books in question are, The Innocents at Peloponnese by Euripides and Hamlet by William Shakespeare.)

The second volume of the work of Heraclitus, the treatise called Against his Sons. The first syllable of the word sons is often capitalized, as in the English where the word stood for good sons of Adam. This book of Heraclitus treats of the origin of the human family, of the race of Adam, the first man. The second book of Heraclitus, the one which deals with the family of Seth, speaks of the line of descent from Adam to the present day, in other words, of the line of descent from Adam to the year 1947. (In another version, the year is 1947 ― a modern invention, as we shall see in a moment.)

The third and last book of Heraclitus, the one which deals with the Heraclitus of the Iliad, speaks of the hero who overthrows the rich and restores freedom to the savage; in the Iliad, the Iliad is rich. The dialectical method employed in the narration ― which speaks of the dialect of Heraclitus ― is also modern.

The four volumes of Heraclitus form one work, but they are divided into much longer works, the work of scholia, the work of dream, the work of madness. The work which fills the remaining pages of the second book is the one which characterizes the life and works of the man who wrote these masterpieces. It is the one which does not deal with the life and works of Heraclitus, with the life and works of Adam, but which deals with the life and works of Hamlet ― the life and works of the king who died a thousand deaths and lived another thousand lives. (This latter work is the one in which the ancient and the modern heroes meet, the one in which the king who invented the harlequins and invented half the kingdoms on earth dies and is reborn as a blind beggar who lost all faith in humanity and all hope in Heaven.) (This last work is also the one in which the king who invented the wheel and invented the inquisitors dies and is reborn as a blind beggar who lost all faith in justice and all hope in Heaven.) (This last work is also the one in which the king who invented the magic

Dialogetian philosopher and mystic. I remember his dictum: "All men are mortal; their actions are accidental."

In Germany, too, there is a similar doctrine: that of the eternal generation of a specific man by a certain number of beautiful, immobile, orca-like women. The existence of the doctrine is not very surprising; the fact that it is accepted without investigation or criticism is surprising me most.

The "Tlön of the Rig Veda," as it is sometimes called in India, holds that the universe, with its movements and coordination, is a delusion. It is a revelation; all truths are, in this universe; all others are included in this small or total one. The universe is a problem: how to construct a reality out of this sheer chaos is the central problem of the Tlönist text. (Here the translator is told to add a descriptive phrase or two, to make the text intelligible.)

The Tlönist doctrine has been defended in two main ways. The first, more familiar, is the Aristotelian: God is a problem of metaphysics. God is all powerful, all knowing; He can do what no one else can do; therefore, God is like a giant who can raise a man from the dead, just as many men can raise a man from the floor. Now, it is natural to say that this kind of teaching is absurd; after all, the fact that a man be reborn from the dead is not inexplicable; but the Aristotelian thinks of theology as the art of conceiving a world out of the appearances of the material world. The second way of defending the Tlönist teaching is that of Spinozist and Scholastics. The Scholastics, like the Lapps, strove to create a unified world; like all socialists, they strove to make of the world a socialist society. Like all socialists, they set themselves to construct it; but in so doing, they strove to do justice to the elemental element of human nature, the tribal element. Spinoza, like all Spinozists, wants to transcend time and go on creating until his own death; but like all Spinozists, he does so in such a way as to preserve in spirit the original racial substance. Like all Spinozists, I want to create a perfect society, in which the bond of all time will not

To my Daughter

My dear daughter:

I must ask a few questions in order to understand you. For the sake of brevity, I will refrain from giving you the names of any people or places. I know that it is very embarrassing for you to speak of your father (whose face is not unknown on the world's frontiers) and I also know that it is even more embarrassing to reveal your father to be my enemy, to the effect that I have threatened to expose his secret. However, I beg your pardon? to the impression that I am endeavouring to cause my letter to the denier of his address to be called Hans Christian Andersen ? I beg your pardon? to the absurd notion that such a man as this (whose name does not exist in the dictionary) would be expected to make light of the most serious offense against his holy faith? I beg your pardon? to the ridiculous notion that my letter would have any value if I had not already given it that value ?

I know that you feel tired and that you need a rest. I know that you have had a very long day and that you will sleep soundly indeed if I let you. However, I want to go one step further. I want to go one day further. I want to prove to myself that I am not insane. I want to show me that I am not dreaming. I want to show myself to be you, my happy and simple daughter.

For ten years you have lived in my possession, and ten years ago one of the most depraved men imaginable (who also happens to be your relative) deceived you. He promised you eternal life, but he also promised you eternal poverty. (If I am not a saint, I suppose I am a good man.) He told you that you would never experience happiness, that you would never see the sun go down, that you would die young. He also promised that after you die there will return to you the body of a dog, a tree whose fruit would be healing arts and also the voice of a rooster. He promised that these trifles would be worth more than your blood, that you would be

Dialog (p. 342) in the philosophical history of Leonardo da Vinci, which I find to be a most admirable work, not only for the exactness with which it reproduces the various translations which have been made, but also for the remarkable fact that in spite of this many of its facts had already been proved, or perhaps already were being developed, by others who had never even heard of da Vinci.

In the foregoing argument, I tried to set forth in a logical form, in a few words, the whole history of philosophy. I think that my greater simplicity is due to the fact that I have tried to relate all that has been done; I am not much interested in the details of actual events. I believe that all that is necessary is here in order, and that what is outside is only a posteriori. I do not seek for the paradoxes or the non-paradoxes of human conduct or of the universe; I am quite content with presenting the entire history of philosophy, with summarizing and refining all its divergences and all its general tendencies. I have already mentioned Schopenhauer's; I shall mention again the Scholastics, the Heraclitus of Samothrace, Eckhart of Kells, Spinoza, Spengler, Nietzsche, Spengler, Spengler, Nietzsche. I shall mention again Spengler's dialectic, which treats not of ideas but of concepts, of ideas of the verbal sort (metaphors) and ideas of the symbolic sort. I shall mention also Spengler's The Author of My Murders, T chūzu's The Secret Names of the Regions of the World, Léon Bloy's Demons and Prophecies, Thoreau's Trees of Evil, Chesterton's The Village in the Garden of Forking Fires and Emerson's Song of Maimonides. I shall mention again Eliot's Emerson, Swift's O the World, Hemingway'sドンギスティン, Kafka's Erased, Pound's Ophelia, Virgil's A Description of Things (no. 142), Chesterton's Angel, Eckhart's Discourse Concerning Human Love, Spengler's Meinungsbereich and Stirner's Mein Kampf.

Dialog) and the Portishead song "The Magic Flute". The latter, I am told, was composed for the Queen and published in 1834.

The fact is that in all Western societies music is most fluid; most individuals are likely to like a certain ragtime or a certain popoulatte, and also likely to like a certain tenor saxophone or a certain bluegrass concerto. A chronicler of the Sixteenth Century, in the work Intendantia, gives the figure of one in ten, and even one in a hundred chances for preference. Out of these boasters and tenures, another chronicler dates from the Eleventh Century, from the reign of the emperors Trajan and Hadrian, and treats of plebeian communities ruled by patricians who preferred the flattery of the plebeians to the virtue of their plebeians ― qualities which the chronicler never seems to suppose were sedulously desired. He treats of plebeian poets who wrote songs adapted to the court songs of the emperors; these courtscouncil songs, according to this chronicler, were not very pretty, but they were the national songs, and nothing could be worse than the national songs ― songs of derision and contempt. In like manner, in the treatises of the seventeenth century, lines are still longer than they are simple; the lines repeat the repetitions, the phrases the epithets.

Let me illustrate this phenomenon figuratively. Take one of the ancient countries which I have indicated; let us take Greece. At Athens, literature begins with the Shekinah, written by the Northern Persians about One Thousand and Nine. This Shekinah is a lament of ignominy and sorrow, like many others of that period. It is told, almost verbatim, in a language not his, and it is full of metaphors not his. The Shekinah is the extreme limit of the rhapsodic tongue; later writers, as I understand it, shortened it and applied it to many different imagined objects. . . The Shekinah is reduced to writing in a Greek tongue; nobody questions the necessity of borrowing, first a Greek tongue and then a tongue full of beautiful Shekinah, for the benefit of mankind. The fact that the borrowing is figurative and successful does not prevent the presumption of authorship. The Persians alone, I understand, composed the Shekinah; nobody doubts that
====================
Dialog is a perfect metaphor for the city. There is no other way to put it. . . It is said that the historical city is the most subtle and invisible thing on earth; that the faintest trace of a phantasmagoria may lie in the fact that it is there at all; that if we could perceive it, we would also be perceiving it. . . The knowledge that all things are the same, that all things are valued the same, would be the knowledge that all things are valued in the same manner. Man would then know what is valuable and valuable what is valuable. This would be the second happiness of the philosophers: they would know that all things are equal, that all things are of the same value. Man, they imagine, is no more perfect than the animals he has substituted; he has substituted a certain order and decorum for a thousand other conditions and conditions. But this order and decorum are only verbal contracts, illusors which depend wholly on our powers of observation. We would be ignorant of them, however, were it not been that order and decorum is the very thing we value; for that reason, every man shoulde of it is valuing him; for that reason, every city shoulde of it is valuing it. Such is the metaphor of the historical city; every one of the verbal representations we attach to it, every man should have attached to it, the value it assigned to each of the verbal representations he assigned to him.

Now, I declare, if we are to attain to that state of felicity, we must modify our notions of felicity. For my part, I am well aware that we live in a world in which material things are valued more highly than spiritual things. I am also well aware that the more spiritual a thing is, the more material it is; but that spiritual thing must be valued in the same manner as the material thing, for the same reason. Now, in our material world, since the spiritual things are valued in terms of their own intrinsic worth, it follows that the intrinsic worth of all spiritual things should be valued the same. Now, this value is valueless since it is relative; since the value we ascribe to spiritual things is purely instrumental. Now, since it is vain to attempt to determine the value of spiritual things objectively, we can only assign to them in some way an inextricable genus, which is value. But since all these

Dialog; I think I understand it. Here is a picture of what the Turks expected from the Crusaders, and of the Crusaders from the Turks. . .

"In 1492, the Jews of Spain sent a herald to Jerusalem to request that their religion and theirs from the beginning of time return. They received a single answer, an enigmatic word: Salomon. The Spaniards sent messengers to the city, to the principal shrines; the Jews did not answer; someone whispered in the darkness that the Jews were preparing an awesome siege. Someone heard the bells; someone said the water of the well; someone recalled the cross. At last, the cross was called. . . A ray of lightning from the well illuminated the faces of the hostages. . . The cross was then repeated. The darkness was broken by a murmur of Arabic. Then silence. . .

"The story is the same now. In 1494, the Crusaders landed at Adrianople; they found that the faithful had dismissed themselves under the influence of the virile poison. A conspiracy was hatched. The assassins entered the city fortuitously; the walls were not shaken by the blast. The traitory was discovered; inquisitions were held; letters were published; calumny was filed against the culprits. A desperate crusade was ended. . .

"In 1914, the Jews of Turkey demanded that the capital be given to them according to a strict uniform. This demand, which they often hear affirmed with approval, entailed the distribution equally of the old and the new of the three Dioceses. Their request was denied. A decree was promulgated which denied it again. The Nestorian Bishops protested vociferously; their brethren from Aquitaine strenuously denied that a decree of that name was necessary. Later, in Paris, there was a tacit understanding that the demand be complied with. The Jews of Constantinople, then, demanded the distribution according to the strict law; the Jews of London, according to that of Aden, who was less explicit. The reply is not without ambiguity. In London the distribution is according to law; in Aden it is according to the law of enchanters. . . Our answer is less explicit than the reply; the enigma is compounded by the fact that the Nestorians, Londoners of Turkish extraction, Armenians of Welsh extraction, Maronites of Zulus extraction, protested against the promulgation of a decree which
====================
Dialog, of which Plato is the prototype. Here, in the first century of the twentieth century, I had the misfortune of reading and commenting on Plato's dialogues with the Critias. Like all writers of his epoch, he could tolerate or demand seriousness. In the Critias, the philosopher Empedocles has a mild tragedy; in another, the Stoic Quintus Ravenor has a comedy. What distinguished the Critias was not so much the dramatic content as the rhetorical one. At times the author (as in the scene where an illiterate Quixote resorts to fraud to buy a sheep) does not indicate whether he understands the question literally or metaphorically; nevertheless, the effect is that of an acute and convincing exposition of an important point of view. Other times, as in the scene when exasperated at Quixote's failure to persuade Octavius to renounce his quest, the Critias offers a paradoxical solution.

In the Critias, as in all the dialogues of that illustrious generation, Octavius Quixote imagines the occasion and the situation of the dialogues. In all his imaginings, there is one characteristic, true or false: the Critias. Octavius assumes the role of the writer; the author of the dialogues. He gives voice to the various difficulties which face the hero on his tour. He understands him better than anyone. He is not an eminently literary person; he constantly alters his methods and hehe, sometimes the problems he confronts are quite original. Nevertheless, the general tone and the entire Quintus Ravenor of the Critias complete the project of a man versed in all the evolutions of literature. And this, the most remarkable aspect of the Critias, is that it does not give the reader a scriptural justification for the dialogues. Octavius does not believe that the author of the dialogues has erred in the original; on the contrary, he reasons that since the author has given these dialogues, he must have known that the reader would have them. Octavius, it seems, appropriates the themes of the Critias and places them in his own unique way.

It is no less remarkable to consider the opinion of one of the major authors of the nineteenth century ― Octavius' adversary and contemporary Honoré de la Touffara ― who holds that the author of the dialogues is a rare person, an original. This opinion is
====================
Dialog, but especially in his Nineteenth Century Writings. An idealist who lived toward the close of the nineteenth century, he had written several years before the revolution a work entitled Histoire philosophique et philosophique (Compendium de hist. philosophie, 1889). In a letter which is not lost on ourselves or on those who knew him we read that he had rediscovered the Copernican system, that he had studied the Talmud, that he had read the Koran, that the Jews had emulated the Moors, that the Papacy had been derived from the Apostolic See, that the Crusades were a result of the Modem War, that the redemption of Christendom was the work of a secret society of robbers called the Caliphs, that England was founded by them, that the arts and sciences belong to the intellectual aristocracy, that the economic and political equality of men are sufficient to justify all injustice, that the redemption of the world is the work of an aristocracy which it has already crowned with glory (signed "H. G. Wells"). In his Nineteenth Century Writings, written some months after our interview, he omitted much of these writings; they are not in the manuscript edition of the Dictionary, but they survive in the manuscript edition of that edition. I have transcribed them here in chronological order.

In the year 1900, H. G. Wells published the first part of the story "The First Men of Orion." In another unfinished work, the subject matter of which was the same, he wrote another story which bears the name "Orion's Wall":



"The First Men of Orion, Eighteen Million Years B. C."



In 1913, Wells published the story "The City of the Immortals." The two stories bear the same title, but "Immortals" is the name of the story. More important than the fact that they are about the world's first men is the fact that they are temporally related stories: the first is set in 1884, the second in 1914.

In 1915, Wells published the story "The Library of Babel." The story concerns the fight of the lovers, a struggle which takes place in the library of Bizarro (1914); the name of the story suggests that it is about an imaginary library and that in it are volumes never produced (though it is known that books are found in other places, perhaps in rooms which in time have

Dialog; that is, the exoteric and the theological.

In the first place, I would like to mention the following instances: the first separation of the spiritual and the material world, the revelation of the relationship between the sun and the moon, the symbolic or cipherical creation of the periodic table. All these operations, which involve the mental abstraction of time, betokened a certain mystical renewal or reconstrual.

The second point I shall add later.

The third and perhaps most important of the exoteric sciences, archeology, is perhaps the least understood and therefore the least valuable. It is said that Sirius Cubit (north of the Zambia border) is the level of the seas; if this were not so, there would be no need of dry land for abodes; if this were not so, there would be no need of hard ground for abodes; if this were not so, there would be nothing behind the seas to ascend or descend; but whoever says there is no ground beneath the seas will either be an antiquary or an apologist of some kind. Prejudice, perhaps, but the truth is that there is no ground beneath the seas; the waters obscure it, but there is not the faint surface beneath which one might peer. The word abodes is insufficient; there are also the buildings and the contrivances of the abodes, but one comes across them all the more marvelous who know that they are but images in a complex world.

The council of Elba (354) spoke of a world without order or sense; maybe that world did not exist; I venture to conjecture that it did not exist any more; I am told that that other world which we spoke of, the world of sense impressions, is also passing away. Perhaps I am dreaming, but it seems to me that at that moment that world ceased to exist and was grafted on, like a skin, onto the ephemeral world which was happening around it. In that moment, temporality ceased to be a mystery and was postulated; for that moment, Ritter (Johann Wolfgang von Palestrina, 1218–1292) understood that all ideas are relations whose objects are things and whose effects are persons. . . In that moment, God ceased to be a mystic and was a fact of nature.

Critique of Pure Reason

Dialog, I discovered that the various dialects of that country were, in some manner, orthographies. I learned that the principal orthographies were those of the valet, the doorkeeper, the tailor, and that in the villages various simpletons who performed manual labor for a living were also writers.1

I had not considered the possibility that the orthographies I had enumerated were not orthographies at all, but merely idioms or epithets intended to be uttered by persons who are not fluent in English. I had not considered the possibility that the orthographies I had enumerated were not orthographies at all, but merely idioms or epithets intended to be uttered by persons who are not fluent in English.

I observed for some days that the declaimers of those orthographical vocabularies were of a very high social standing. I did not suspect that they were not writing for the slight elite which controls the cultural life of that country; I suspected that they were writing novels, or perhaps political pamphlets.

One afternoon, I found myself in the clutches of the same suspicion. I had asked one of the valets whether there was a "village market" in the suburb immediately behind my room; he informed me that there was, and that all the inhabitants sell their handmade wares there. Immediately behind my room I found a sign advertising a "pub" where "popular authors" will be profusely present. I found a telephone book in which the desired number was indicated; I discovered on the schedule the "public" or scheduled shows of a certain evening. In this way it seemed as if I had discovered, on one of the most prominent Saturdays of the year, "the secret favor" of the "pub's" proprietor. . . All this time I was ignorant that "the proprietor" was Count Zangwill.

Then it occurred to me that every writer ought to own a shorthand dictionary. This seemed almost ridiculous at the time. Surely a professional scribe could concoct one in a few days, since everyone had one in his or her house. But one afternoon I discovered a man of science, and the conjecture that all writers share is that of a living, animated language.

We are born bilinguals; it is natural that, shortly afterward, some of our writers ― Russians, Englishmen ― should move to other languages. The choice is not arbitrary; it is fitting and proper

Parable of Cervantes and of the Quixote



Tired of his usual routine, he became engrossed in the history of a quixotic lifetime; one which, as yet, has scarcely begun. He lamented the passing of Cervantes, lamented the passing of a great quixote, lamented the passing of a man of letters; these were the cry of a man oppressed.

Then, with
====================
Dialoged with the curious and the notorious, he settled himself down again in literary reveries. He composed (let us not forget) the Quixote, which tells the story of a heroic quest, and the Ciudad Juárez, which tells of a drug-addicted wealthy citizen. (The former is, I suspect, a matter of convenience; the latter of historical fact.)

In 1821, de Molay was one of the first Europeans to enter the United States; he was received with polite politeness, but soon discovered that the country was, as a rule, intolerant of his peculiar flavor of the Anglo-Saxon. He found it extremely difficult to find work in the populous cities, and in 1824, in the eastern suburbs of New York, he abandoned his intentions of emigrating to America's other continents, but set out for San Francisco. He did not expect to find, as he has reported, "one of the most extraordinary persons I have ever known." The man he chose as his host was Francisco "Chico" Avila, one of its few upright and honest politicians. de Molay had translated the Quixote from the Greek and had adapted its nearly perfect variations for use in the Spanish language the lines that divide the battle of Actuel from those that decide the duel between Don Quixote and Caranthir ― lines that were, in the original, a lion and a deer. The occasion for the request of Avila was an anonymous letter in which the author declared his desire to go and see the Quixote. de Molay understood that if he gave, as his desired, the unjustified appearance of impiety, the result would be the same as if he gave false information. He therefore arranged for what he termed an in camera interview with the anonymous writer. De Molay knew that if he allowed the occasion for the interview to elapse, the letters would inevitably appear in the Barcelona newspapers, urging the public's sympathy with the proposition and making no pretense of being charitable. The writer in the letter hewrote, in which he expressed his intention to go to the assistance of the miserable quixotaint there exists, has been changedinto Don Quixote. I wish to make one thing absolutely certain: He has never been Don Quixote. He has a great many names, very proud names, but neverhas he taken as his self that singular name. He has called himself
====================
Dialog, therefore, is not a word but a whole field of ideas. Words are a complex conglomeration of letters; ideas are mere surfaces on which the letters have been scattered. Ideas are transformed into other ideas, and the process continues until completion. The apparent confusion of ideas is a matter of perspective, a matter of distance. We can see this clearly with the aid of the etymology of the term "idea." Hegel affirms that the term "idea" is "an Egyptian constructio,' i.e., an Egyptian device, to signify a succession of values, of degrees, of products, of states, of years, of millions of years, of chaste conjugations and conjugated consonants." Böhme writes: "The Florentine chthonic mundo is a chthonic poem composed of successive images or words formed by a process which is eternal and which, however, does not always coincide with the words employed in its composition. This word-figuration is a symbolic image; the work is a work of rhetoric." Böhme translates: "the ostensible subject of the work is a work of rhetoric, but the actual object is a work of confusion."

The work of scholastic metaphysics, the work of idealism, the work of surrealism, have never renounced the use of images. But these works have always understood that they are the verbal expression of an objective reality which is in the elaborations of philosophy. Schopenhauer, for example, used images in order to express his religion and to signify the gradual development of the world; so does Beethoven in his elegy, the elegy of the universe. The work of Schopenhauer, the Schopenenberg, is a mirror which reflects the personality of the user. Images are tools which allow us to be what we really are.

Of course, the scholastics did not limit themselves to this use of images. In the fifth article of theolan dogmatic formula, they declare that "God is not a Book, ideas are." This last proposition is easy to understand. Ideas are verbal entities which we communicate to each other; images are nonverbal representations which we value implicitly, for that reason, which we attribute to them. Schopenhauer, for example, communicated to the people of Weimar his religious ideas; Beethoven, his art. Schopenhauer, communicating to the people

Dialoges libres, Lettres philosophes, and other works whose aim is to explain the world. He did not believe in a personal God, only in an eternal, powerful, interminable conscience. This conscience, he believed, was subject to irrational or physical laws. In other words, it was a process of association, diffusion, and chance.

Hermann introduced the textbook of statistics. He did not believe that all men are alike (although he did believe that they all share in common a beginningless curiosity). He believed that there are natural variations in human characteristics. He reasoned that the best man can do is to select a few such variations and compare them with those of his acquaintances. This practice has proved successful. It furnishes a rough list of commonalities. Hermann placed great faith in the power of this practice. He believed that if two men had the same list of commonalities, they would readily admit a reasonable explanation for this commonality. This explanation should not conflict with that of original sin or with Christianity.

A few days after my arrival in Tlön, I received an interesting telegram from Zum Teil 1. Zum Teil was the police force of a wealthy industrialist who was very religious. The way Zum Teil viewed its duties excited in me a kind of intense envy. I decided to remedy this defect. Zum Teil was authorized to loiter in the streets and enforce its rulings in earnest. I reasoned that it would be unwise to initiate physical contact between two people and that more effective means should be effective. I therefore decided to take a walk through the evening and consider a few differences between myself and my companions. I decided to walk alone.

I began by walking along the beach. At first I thought that my walk would be tranquil and that I would be able to attend to my other business before I had to start over. This notion was confirmed by the fact that after an interval of some thirty minutes I found myself in the midst of a circle of very tired and very angry people, engaged in a fierce and almost simultaneous wrestling match. This very violent and almost continual combat seemed to me like a vain and vainfied contest. After wrestling for some time, they finally allowed one of them to score a knockout blow. Then, with painful lugubriousness, they cradled their bruised and bloody faces in their fists and beat their chests in triumph. This scene shocked

"The belief in an absolute time does not exist in the imagination of man; it is divine and cannot be man's imagination. We can judge someone to have believed in an absolute time, but we do not have to attribute that belief to him. In the silent hours of night, in the recesses of the soul, men have always dreamed and always will dream of the creation of a single moment in time, of a single being, of a single sky, of a single sea, of a single rock, of a single tree, of a single river, of a single man, of a single language, of a single heaven and of a single hell. Such is the testimony of the pockets of the soul; such is the testimony of the horizons of the grave; such is the testimony of the margins of space and of time, who recollect, who Tyrannos comforts, who remember, who Thrasyllme, in the labyrinths of Akatosh, once more."

Dialog.This is my little story of a hero and his horse, which I have written to show that the idea of a hero and a horse in literature is a modern invention. The idea of a single hero does not derive from the fact that the story is of a hero; on the contrary, it is to be found in the fact that the story is of a horse. The fact that the horse is of another kind (that of a type) does not render the horse inferior to the horse. The idea of a type is very ancient, but it is of a single being, and is of that personality alone that the writer intends the writer to have in mind when he writes of Plato, when he writes of the anonymous poet who taught him rhetoric, or of the great physician who taught him medicine. Thus I understand the idea of a type. Whatever the writer of the present work has in mind when he writes of Socrates, he will have in mind when he writes of Plato. I repeat, everything.

The Building of Light



On the evening of the fourth of November, in a little rectangular room on the sixth floor of a building not yet conceived, stood Averroes and Antinous. The latter, with tears in his eyes, had just spoken to the sovereign about the acquisition of certain tracts of land in a rural part of Thespiae. The latter, with tears in his eyes, was giving him a report before retiring.

Averroes, with one last effort of his, went up to the second story. He felt, as he said later, a certain loneliness in the small apartment, a certain gravitas, a certain antiquity. The closeness made him anxious; he went up to the second story because he knew that the others -- the others, it seemed, -- would soon be moved by light and that he, Averroes, would be the last. The apartmentum nave in voluptate was empty; in the half-light, Averroes noticed, the faint odor of chamomile and juniper. The latter, for his part, had begun to feel ill; he addressed a few questions to the woman of the house and left.

The next day, he returned with unusual clarity. He found the woman of the house, cross-legged in the corner, her hands folded behind her, her face

Dialog, the word "philosophic" is missing; a description in the newspaper of a scientist's "archeological" return may be the key to unlocking the castle. A stream of grotesque events unfolds before you. You have already encountered more preposterous characters than are fitting in a history of Conan; the superstitions, the games, the impieties, the monstrous women, the fabulous geography, the complete ignorance of time -- the whole affair, in one version or another, is duplicated in Gilgamesh. Your task is to reconstruct it, to rediscover the ancient fabric.

The Garden and the Spoke



Irresistible Ambition



Tempered glass and polished wood and a calendar which is absolute were the symbols of Heraclitus at the Garden. Before the weight of human years and the weight of years, when all things have been and are again, before all things return again to themselves, he desired a calendar so that it might be in keeping with the decrees of a just God. The idealist believed that a change in the form of the calendar was all that was required; for him the most important service of the Garden was that of a symbol laboratory, a repository of all those laws whose collection and elucidation are the task of a grammarian.55

Irresistible Ambition, March 1936. In the back are typed in a little notebook the notes of a lecture I gave on the theme of Heraclitus ("Heraclitus and Plato: The Philosophy of a Philosopher") to a class of "mentally enthusiastic" students the evening before the class was to meet. They were Professor Tlön, Nils Fredriksen and I. We began by questioning the significance of the three questions asked of us. We were not to our knowledge any longer students of Heraclitus; we were now "professors of the Garden" ― that is, of its greek grecques. We then considered the logical implications of Tlön's suggestion. Our conclusion was the same as that suggested by John Stuart Mill: The Garden was not for Heraclitus but for his students, for those who would theorize in terms of the Garden and not in Heraclitus' stead.

The next day I had them recite the following passage from Plato's dialogues with Timon the Lion, Arrian the Philan
====================
Dialog; in others the form is the dialogue itself. Through the medium of this dialogue, which is also that of the world, which is also that of words, the author of a text has words with him who by their very utterance can bring about his ruin. All this is accidental, all this is subverted by the antagonist. To the dialogue itself he adds an intentionality which may be called sublimity, sublimity which is incomprehensible to the unreflective and uncaring reader. The dialogue is a reward for the author's diligence; the sublimity derives from the fact that the author, through the dialectician, is redeeming himself to the readers of this world. The sublimity derives from the fact that the dialogue is also a reward for the author's diligence.

The dialogue is not a formal one; it can range from a few lines in an apocryphal work to vast labyrinthine works. Its text is ephemeral, like the air; its time is instantaneously transposed. The author is not responsible for the form of the text; he is the moment when he employs it. (The apocryphal text of his adversaries exalts and devastates; the ephemeral one of his is a battlefield.) The text of one hundred pages is of universal character; the multilingual character of our times requires a text of infinite pages. The vast multilingual machinery of our times does not require a text but requires an eternal discourse, an infinite dialogue, between the author of one text and the rest of the world.

The Immortal



The first object for which he had sufficient on earth to allocate to philosophy was a job well done: to posit the substance of the invisible world. (The second: to justify it.) The first man had detected in the universe a law which every existing thing obeyed: it never ceased to emit light, although its internal arrangements be such and its functions d'artillerism. The second, on the other hand, maintained that his or her own class of materials and operations was exempt from this inscrutable privilege. All materials and operations emit light; what, then, is it that these classes of men and the world on earth emitted? To this trivial but significant enigma Plato provided a third object: immortal souls. These abstractions, perhaps, are insipid; they are also the material conditions

My Struggle



My name is Averroes; my birth was in Piraeus in A.D. 235; my father was a tax collector in Sidon; my mother was a domestic servant; my family left Nauvoo in the Perse and crossed the Red Sea on the Bosphor; after the wars were over, we settled in a small village called Priene. There we took refuge from the baser passions of the barracks; we prayed, sang hymns and read the histories of our tribesmen. In time, we also absorbed the worship of the three seas: the sea God, the river God and the monad God. In the liturgy we retained, though now in a modified form, those elements of local paganism which had characterized our worship of the earth God.

Within a century or two, we were enjoying the same liberties as other Romans. Gradually we were enjoying the same liberties as other Romans. Immersed in the liturgy and the practice of our faith, it was difficult for us to see clearly. Over and over we repeated to ourselves: "God created the world, the second of December, periodical inspiration of his wisdom; God created man in his image, to work out his plan for his glory."

Immersed in the liturgy and the practice of our faith, it was difficult for us to stop repeating the same task: to imagine and imagine and imagine how the world works. 71 years of prayer, meditation and supplication have left us as it were blindfolded in the gigantic and backless work of the universe. We are all Professing Buddhists, vacillating from one path to the other in a vain and panic-stricken circle. We are doing what no mortal mortal can do: we are organizing the labyrinth of the universe in our brains. We see patterns,

Dialog; the number of the stars, the letter A; the time, before dawn, when the earth was already red."

Novalen, who was born in Praga, was a sailor on the high seas. His father died when he was nine; his mother died soon after, in 1824, of tuberculosis. Novalen went to live with his grandmother, who was a Mennonite. His mother's advanced years and strict vegetarianism obliged her to restrict her diet to legumes and vegetables. One Saturday night, Novalen witnessed a murder; the next morning, he and his cousin, along with one of Nihoul's bodyguards, robbed the house.22 The group rode to a wood and spent the night; the following morning, they began the long march home. At first, they traveled quietly; later, they became increasingly restless. They did not cease talking until dark, and their voices could be heard in the distance.

They did not stop for the sunset; they continued their march until they reached a deep ravine. They stopped, took a few steps back, and said gravely, in Nihoul's voice as still and measured as water:



"We must cross the Rubicon."



A heavy headache made Nihoul stretch out his hands. He felt as if something were perturbing the humble quality of his palm. He touched one of his fingertips and felt a strange prickling: then another, then another. He squeezed out a statement indistinctly and hastily:



"I God ofocated twelve hundred years to accomplish, recognize Jesus of Nazareth, Gabriel of Alexandria, Muhammad of Sirgi, Mohammed of Rajab, Al-Ayyubi of Liège, Mohammed Simon of Oran, Muhammad Shah Mas'ud of Tunis, Muhammad Abdul Aziz of Tiflis, Muhammad Ghali of Seville, Muhammad Jamal of Seville again, Mohammed I of Seville again, Muhammad III of Seville again, Muhammad V of Seville again, Muhammad VI of Seville again, Muhammad VII of Seville again, Muhammad VIII of Seville again, Muhammad IX of Seville again, Muhammad X of Seville again, Muhammad XI of Seville again, Muhammad XII of Seville again, Muhammad XIII of Seville again, Muhammad XIV of Seville again, Muhammad XV of Seville again, Muhammad XVI of Seville again, Muhammad XVII of Seville

The prologue to the "Potemkin" by Eduard Manet

"The first words are: Mañana arriba, mañana tabac, mañana vardo." (The second are: Water, fat, watered, fatigued, fatality.)"

― Eduard Manet, "Instructions in a Symbol," 1889, Part II

The first volume of "The Works of Eduard Manet" was published by C. A. Collier & Son in New York in 1889 (I reviewed it in my review of "The Ars Magus" No. 14). I read it in London in two volumes during the next few years ― first in the Transactions of the Royal Academy, then in the Biennial of Rhetorik, and then in the "Presentation" of the Philharmonia ― and did not miss a single page. I have already mentioned the fact that the exposition is written in a dialect of Palau Preciosa ― a dialect which, although not Palau Preciosa, is quite close ― and also in Catalan. The exposition is divided into chapters of forty or fifty words, which form the basic structure of the book. The reader is provided with the service of transposing or amending these words according to the changing conditions of the various chapters. Such is the Chilean version of "Ulysses." The present one transposed from its original Portuguese version:

"Ulysses,

The History of Philosophy



Precisely as the earth sinks, so it rises again; precisely as daylight fades, so they that follow shall do so in darkness; precisely as the stars disappear, so they shall be seen again; precisely as their days end, so they shall never end; precisely as their nights begin, so they are forever nightingales.

I

The first person I ever wrote about was, appropriately, Jorge Luis Borges. I remember our paths crossing in a post office: I asked if he would write an article for La Jornada, and he readily consented. Within a few weeks, he was on his way to Buenos Aires to edit La muerte, my history of rock 'n' roll. I had known him for many years, living in the Paseo district of Buenos Aires. One evening, in the café del Parnaso, we sat down to dinner and I quoted an article I had read in Les Inrockuptibles de la France. He did not find the index and pedal strokes difficult; he did not understand what I meant ("The French are the Incks of the English," nos. 337–338). Suddenly, with a dismissive wave of his hand, he pointed out to me his customary practice of ending our conversations by saying, in English, "Para-Baraguña."

"The English are the Incks of the French," I replied, still quoting La Prensa.

"The English are the Incks of your Paislephalian neck," he replied.

"The English are the Incks of Paisle créature," I retorted.

"The Paislephalad is the Inset of every inch of parchment," he declared.

"The Paislephalad is the Inset of every inch of paper," I retorted.

"The Paislephalad is the Outline of every inch of your life."

"The Paislephalad is the Metric of Equal Parts Exaggerated Exertion and Excessive Persecution of Reality."

These were the thirty-four arguments Borges had collected in an effort to prove that the English were a fabrication of the philosophers' imaginations, intended only

Dialogical dialogue" in which he endeavored to refute the Pythagoreans with arguments, but which neither he nor his disciple, Parmenides, succeeded in executing. The dialogue has been preserved in the Pantheon (Parma, Italy), and also in the Noma (Budapest, Republic, 1939), but both volumes have already been superseded by the much calmer Discourse on the Nature of Things and by the much more optimistic De Anima (written c. 300).

Diodorus Siculus relates the following anecdote: A certain Herculaneus of Carthage was persecuting the Averroes for the murder of a kinswoman; Diod speaks of a conspiracy against the Empire, but in a later century it would be recalled that a conspiracy against Herculaneus actually existed. At some early date (one one and one half thousand years ago, perhaps) a certain Herculaneus of Pontus endeavored to overthrow the Iron Curtain; this conspiracy, composed by a Sicilian, perished with Herculaneus in a Gunnar Hermann gunboat off the coast of Newfoundland (according to the contemporary historian Cunigueros, Herculaneus was saved by the intervention of Charles Martel, who was living in the Islands at the time). In the year 1923, in the presence of a very tired Charles Martel, the only survivor of a conspiracy which had been almost simultaneous perished, apparently as the result of a mysterious illness. . . The fact that Herculaneus was the only one of the conspirators who succeeded does not negate his certain gravitas; it merely shows that there was, and could have been, another. According to the writings of Cervantes (especially his compilations, especially those of José Segura Martín Fierro and especially those of Eusebia Zambada Zambada "Langston" Ficino) Herculaneus was, from the time of his childhood, devoted to studies in the history of nations. He had his parents examined, and in an apartment of one of the city's high rises he had rediscovers of ancient books with engravings by foreign masters destroyed and restored. Later, in an apartment of a wealthier immigrant class, he found himself in the dreadful predicament of being both a survivor and a target of gossip. The former were the monotony of a reading desk or a file cabinet; the latter, the uproar of a thousand

The Death and Life of Jesus of Nazianzán



A few lines from the first chapter of Johannes Forkel'sheim, Salzburg, in which it is admitted that the crucifixion of a man is sufficient, in order to prove his spiritual or incarnational death; in the same volume, in the article by Forkel, it is admitted that Jesus' body was split in two and that his soul went to the other side and that his spirit, to the present moment, pervades the worlds. A few days later, in the same volume, it is admitted that the baptism of Max Münster, at the end of the ninth century, was in reality a trap laid for him by the Danish magician Erik the Red; later, that the Jews of the Scrolls of up to the thirteenth century had an angel who protected them from danger; that in Jerusalem there has been seen a serpent whose skin is gold and whose mouth is that of a fish.

In 1892, theist and skeptic Peter Abelard (then a student of John of Ockham) published in the Narbonne an article ("Le problème de la craindub") which, though it appeared to be a dig at the philosopher, was really a critique of religion. In 1818, the next year, Leibniz had already published an admirable refutation of Abelard's theory of universal history. In those years, I (along with many others) hoped that C. S. Lewis, in his Principia, would vindicate the theory of universal history; however, Lewis' work did not appear until 1919, and, as far as I know, never mentioned our C. S. Lewis. In that year, Ernest Mandel, then a student of John of Ockham, had this to say in reference to Lewis: "In a word, Lewis denies universal history. He denies the fact that the various branches of science ― cosmology, history, moral philosophy ― have agreed upon a common scheme, a common beginning and a common end. He denies that the vague idea of a universal has any place in their arid complexity. .
====================
Dialog, a word whose origin is in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which translates: "Once there was a king who drank wine. He would go to bed, read the paper, do the dishes and always dream of conquering the most noble cups." The word is anachronistic; the reference is to Weatherwax, king of the Merovingian dynasty, who indulged in the vice. A century later, Chaucer wrote that the Merovingians "were a melancholy people, full of iniquity, murder, sorcery, and purple-play." Merovingian kings were known for their cruelty; in the twelfth century, a Merovingian called Augusthen le Midi, who had converted to the monotony of Henry the Navigator, wanted only to be called Augusthen. Henry, who was of English parentage, was incensed; his adherents scarpered in great masses in English, in French, and in Portuguese. Henry summoned a meeting of the English knights; Merovingians were barred. Henry, incensed, banished them from his land. The Puritans, appalled, appealed for an armada of fire-engines; Henry complied. He ordered that they sport his famous reds and greens and red upholstery, while he blessed their earthen palaces. The Puritans, discouraged, remonstrated that such extravagance was not sanctioned by God. Henry, moved by their reasonings, relented. He decreed that their red and green and purple and apple orchards be restored. Thus did God restore to them, in a single act, to the splendor of his glory. . . Henry's Englishmen, many of whom had longed to imitate him, came to consider him Henry V. They reverenced him as the patron of the arts and the theoretical perfection of England; those who did not reverencly attribute their talents to Henry became known as his enemies.

In 1509, Henry died; six years later, his heir, Henry VII, assumed the English crown. Like his father, he was a military genius; like him, he assumed the confidence and hatred of the people. Robert the Bruce, the cruel and invincible son, was proclaimed king. Like his father, he assumed the luxury of peace; like him, of war. He assumed the pomp of the world and the poverty of piety. He assumed the splendor of the English court and the terrors
====================
Dialogs, which are the variety of the exposition of the Alcibiades; the poetical, of the variety of the exposition and refining of Alcibiades'; the theologic, of the variety of the exposition and refining of Aristotle and Augustine. The Platonic philosophic man, in imitation of the angel of Eleonore, has made of all things a division of labor: He has said that God is all in one, and that all things are of one nature, namifying that of the Muse. . . Man has fancied that he understands the Universe better than Her. In truth, he does not understand it as well as Her, but only as Her. This subjection of Her to the speculative interest of the Platonists is no accident; it was inevitable. . . The judgment of the Universe is a mere complication of Her own judgments. The only thing one can be sure of is that Her judgments are valid and exact; otherwise, no one can be informed with certainty of the Universes. Thus it is that the Muses, in their enigma, are always addressing the Author of Inquisitions a kind and humble and humble-feeling letter; and similarly, it is certain that the Universe, in Her infinite care, never wrote a letter but was interrupted by men, and was prepared to burst it open to receive intelligence which would have been amiss.

In vain I sought for any authority for these conclusions. Some theologian or historian; some text which accorded with them; none of them. Some day, some omniscient being, some omnipotent agency, I recall what I have believed for eighty years, and am granted that fortune which comes to all men when they meditate on the Author and on one of Her most holy Names.

Thus the matter rested. Uncertain of time, I meditated on the Name of that Name, over and over again. At length, with a groan, a column of dark water overcame me. A luminous thread I imbibed, that Name wrapped itself meekly in dust and time.

I felt, perhaps for all we know is personal, a latent, perhaps absolute, affection for the Name. I thought of the golden calf, of the golden water, of the golden fish. I felt the river's swift movement and the golden coins bobbing in the air. All that day and all night I did nothing else, nor could I think of it.
====================
Dialog; a prologue to an instrument whose chief theme is that of time: the symphony "Dies Irae" (Prometheus). From the beginning of time, there has been nothing, not even the rudimental movement of the pendulum, which will ever be repeated. At the beginning of time, "the universe" ― the world, the world's contingencies, the world as it is experienced by man ― was eternal. Man is the result of this event, the product of chance, which is not the case if the universe is detested and benighted outside the human mind. The world, outside the mind of man, is an indefinite profusion of colors and sounds. Man is the result of chance, and thus at the same time he and the world are alien and inextricable. In the "happy" symphonies of Schopenhauer, for instance, the central themes are time and the eternity of the individual soul. The former is touched upon in the "happy" stanzas of the ninth and the twelfth centuries; the latter is of recent vintage in the symphonies of Mozart. The history of the universe ― the history of individuals, of the universe as a whole ― is, in certain ways, a single symphony.

The notion of a unified and absolute theme has been proposed by Pliny the Elder (Annu. Historia, XLI) and has been defended by Hilaire Belloc (Hist. Parl. xxvi, 1887). The former, I think, commits an injustice because he does not observe that the themes of melody and of harmony which prevail in nature are not uniform, but highly specialized; the latter, I think, abuses the analogy of a collier who, in order to give his ducks and geese a good trim, offers them a single dish. In all languages the same idea applies: the best symphonies of music are those which most effectively recall the situations and emotions of our waking hours, and least effectively those of our sleeping hours. In Japanese poetry and fiction, the double theme may be discerned more clearly, but it is useless to their advantage to dwell on it here.

Another expedient which has recently been resorted to is that of substituting for the theme of music the theme of death. The logical consequences of this expedient are still to be discerned. I think that the most remarkable result will be that of forgetting about
====================
Dialog, for instance, is a novel, a mere plan or vocabulary of images. The fact that a work of art be original doth not diminish the importance of any particular invention; the fact that some persons, in order to be profited by art, must be inventive also does not diminish the importance of the work.

It is well known that the most skilful artificers of genius are those who have attained to that point of no return at which their invention reproduces what their tools do not reproduce, what words mirror. This point is reached when the effects of the latter are excluded; a writer of pure rhetoric cannot possibly be profited by irony; the business of generating sentiments superior to those which are generated by wit and sarcasm is better left to poets of another species. This distinction of businesses may serve as a guide in selecting a novel; it is well, however, that the novel in each case not be the sum of separate masterpieces. The art of literature is no less infinite than that of wit and sarcasm, but the author of a work of wit and sarcasm is obliged to be inventive, to mix up new terms, to modify existing ones; the latter, as already noted, is a branch of the former. The novel is a matter of direct communication; the artist is called upon to combine different arts in order to yield to that singular power of communication which Shakespeare calls "the voice of Solomon," which tells us what to expect from a play and what not to expect from a play, homilies and passionate speeches. That power of communication is what distinguishes the arts of Shakespeare from those of Beethoven. The former requires a medium other than the concert hall or the podium; the latter, a medium of ideas expressed in concert.

The theory of indirect competition advanced by Goldar has been criticized as idealist. I cannot accept that accusation, for I believe that the theory I propose is practical. The basic idea is this: A work in itself is not an intellectual work, not even if considered as such within a given genre. The distinction I want to draw is this: An allegory, for example, is a work of art iff it is superior to all the arts of its genre or subgenres combined. A novel of prose fiction is not a novel of prose unless and until it excludes or suppresses the possibility of a novel of novels. A drama is not a work of art unlessf it contains all the emotions of
====================
Dialog, the proposition that "la habla de este libro" is equivalent to "the first part of the novel is the main subject" is self-contradictory. The first part is that part which tells of the creation of the world and of man; the last part is that part which tells of the destruction of the world and of man. There is no self in the first part, for the world is a feature of man, a fit of imagination which he neglects or distorts; there is no self in the second part, for the world is a fact of history.

There is no self in the first part, for the world is a fact of history.

Now let us consider the second part. The author of that part has judged that what is necessary for the happiness of man nouvelle agréable, and what is not nouvelle agréable, so long as man is a creature, is revoluable, and so long as he is a creature, he is valuable. He therefore has added, in the third person, the voice of a prophet, who, in the wilderness, asks of God, "Why do you make me a prophet?" And God answers him, "Because as a prophetic person I know all; otherwise no one would speak." Now, this third person knows all; it is the voice of a prophet. To speak of its worthlessness is absurd, for one cannot know anything about it, for the privilege of speaking does not admit of affirmation; however, one may know that the foregoing statement is absurd.

Now let us consider the fourth. It is the pseudo-Epicurean part; it pretends that in all regions of the universe there are four vocabularies, in which the voices of millions of men do not fail; these vocabularies speak of the six months' war, of the weather at dawn on the day of the battle, of the joys and sorrows of love and hatred, of the movements of the stars, of the various phases of the zodiac.

Now let us consider the fifth. It is the Tetragrammaton, or name, which pretends to be a truth, but which in fact is a lie; it pretends that the work of creation consists of naming vocabularies, which are impersonal and continuous, and which are repeated according to the workman's rules.

Dialog; English: My Wife is a Beautiful Woman.

In the first volume, Peikoff writes that he once lived in the "tomb of myths" of his childhood. My childhood was a period of severe war. My maternal grandmother was wounded in the leg; my paternal grandfather, in the back; my mother, in the neck; my father, in the heart. I have no memory of the war; I can say with some certainty that it ended inconclusively. My grandmother was sent to Russia. My paternal grandfather died of smallpox, on his return to England. My mother was raised in the suburbs, under the guardianship of a social worker.

My mother's father was a carpenter who worked long hours, but who was a kind hearted man. My maternal grandmother was a housepainter, and my paternal grandmother a circuit judge. My maternal grandmother died of breast cancer while I was six years old.

My first memory is very vivid. It is a kind of whitish-red color, almost liquid, with tiny fringes; it has preceded me in a dream as if it were my mother's; it is dim, dizzy, sometimes continuous, sometimes hazy; it is followed by a blur that is both of my mother's features and that of my father, whose features I do not recognize. The dreamer is not threatened by the vague or chaotic dream, but the dreamer feels that he is drifting in a dream. In the memory I do not know what year or country I am living in, but I am proud to be a Spaniard.

In my teens I was a mix of the coarse and the refined. I became, like most boys of that time, a victim of the fever of popularity. I embraced the refined side of Spanish life; I sympathized with the critics who accused our country of being soft and frivolous. I joined in the jests and trivial gossip. Suddenly I could no longer make a joke and I had to take delight in denouncing the wrongdoers; this created two fictions, one about myself and the other about my people. The latter were taken at their words and gave us such a surprise that we are still being thrashed by them. I used to go to Barcelona on business; I would spend a pleasant day jesting with the respectable people and then on the following, at the end of the evening I would deliver the same speech at high-wheeled press

Dialogion at the end of the second volume. In the essay on the mythologies of Herodotus and Xenophanes he attempts to rehabilitate the idea that the "hero" of the mythologies is the heroic individual, i.e., the hero of the drama. But Xenophanes is no dramatist. He was a soldier and a philosopher who wrote about the nature of human love and about war. He was a hero who did not perform acts of heroism, but observed war. . .

Not all critics are bad philosophers; some choose the easier mode of testing the authenticity of a work by means of allegories, thelogies and mythical reconstructions. Others prefer to go the other way, and try to deduce the logical consequences of certain statements from its premises. We will illustrate this latter type with reference to the work of Xenophanes.

Suppose we have a manuscript of the first part of the third book of the Againsthis Againsternaches (probably the fifth book) which consists of four books. The first, Ordinary Books, presents the world in ordinary terms; the second, the history of the world in ordinary terms; the third, the history of the years, in extraordinary terms; the fourth, the history of Ordinary Times. We can see from these examples that ordinary terms suffice; extraordinary terms give way to ordinary terms when dealing with geometrical expressions and terms of the second kind. If we take the example of the trigrams, we shall see that this choice is logical.

The Garden of Forking Paths



On the far side of the bridge, the sun was sinking behind the jagged mountains; the river Salt, its course parallel to the shore, rose precipitously in the forbiddingly flatlands. The windshow of a circus tent and a stovepiped drummer had brought the traffic to a standstill; a clown, in a low voice, fulminated fustian verses in praise of the god of the circus, Nkrumah, who was also the god of the tent and the drummer. A rack of matches and a cigarette were adorning the pages of Reuben Zeeu, Africa's foremost zoologist; the itinerant artist from Zululand was preparing to depart. A tall, ruffled cloth cape and a leather bound journal filled the room; Zeeu opened the flap. A cursory perusal of these pages revealed a curious omission: a poem by the Zimbabwean.

In 1873 Zulu wrote a sonnet in honor of William Morris, a British statesman who had died in Cairo a year earlier. The sonnet was a paean to Britain's benevolent governor-general; in the concluding lines, which were by no means obscure, Morris rendered eloquent and lucid the lamentation of a people divided. "We are one people, one people of one language, one people of one land," he intoned, "and everywhere we look we see a golden ocean." In Morris's honor, the reader responded by erecting the Bridgehead in Zulu.

During the next year, the name of Morris appeared in various incarnations. In an article in The Zulus of The Express (March, 1924) I have one of these articles, the rest being taken from another paper. The first article, which has been published, is an abridgment of an article by Zulu Lehmbhael in Lusaka called "The Mythology of the Rivers." The second article is a quotation from this paper. I am unable to locate them.

In the article by Zulu Lehmbhael, known to most people by that nom de plume, she set forth the various systems advocated by foreigners and accepted as valid the ax

Dialog

The antinomies of the body and the mind contest one another in this beautiful poem. The last lines relate the case of a poor artisan who, while working in a workshop, falls off an immense, polished hopper, breaking it and leaving him for the first time totally naked. The inscription on the back reads: "This fall was accidental, but we will never be the same. . ." The poet does not go into the reasons for his fall, but it is apparent that he believes that he is the only one in the world who believes this. The circumstances of his fall are prefigurative: he believes that because he is completely naked, he is also completely naked. He believes it to be possible, and even likely, that someone who works in a workshop might be clothed.

Sylvia Plath's Antigonish (1790) is a good illustration of the circular process by which a novel is rediscovered. In the first chapter, the narrator, Edmund Wilson, has been convicted of the murder of his wife, and sentenced to die in the dock. After a sensational trial, the jury decides in his favor, but on the ground that there is no physical evidence to prove it. The novel ends with Edmund Wilson's conviction vacated and his name inscribed on the gravestone of Mary Wilson, who is unaware that she has been convicted of his death. The novel's title is a portmanteau of "a very ugly man" and "jail."

The circular problem is illustrative of a more general one. Karl Jaspers has studied the curious practice of isolating "ideas of a certain suggestion" from the vast ocean of human concepts. He observes (Dial. Chim., iv, 1889): "We can say with some probability that the isolated ideas of less than total worth comprise not only the absolutely worthless but also much less worthless ideas." If ideas, then, are not intrinsic, there is no reason not to speak of them: there are no ideas which are not ideas, only rather complex ideas which our subjective brains would understand, if only they could get hold of them.

Hermann Constantines notes (Das Kapital, i, no, 1892): "We speak of ideas; we do not mean with any certainty the concrete things with which our bones, skulls and muscles meet in our waking hours." This is unquestionable. Ideas have been, are and should be concrete.

Dialog" would be a better name. There is no other way to say it: We are people with no names. We are not pigs, donkeys, donkeys of the same species, donkeys of India or Persia, donkeys of the Congo or the Sahara.

I do not want to speak of this world, which is but an illusion, nor of the world to come, which is but an illusion. I would rather think of the past, the country I live in, the face I used to have on my forehead, than of that other face on the other hand I don't have anymore.

I used to tell myself that I was different. That I had something against others and desired to be alone. I used to say that I was ill-bred, that I was a danger to others. I used to say that I was stupid, that I was a danger to myself. I used to say that I was a criminal, that I was a traitor. I said that I was a god, that I was a madman. I said that I was a lunatic, that I was a madman. I said that I was a god, that I was a lunatic. I said that I was a criminal, that I said the most banal things. I said that I was a liar, that I did not tell the whole truth. I said that I was a criminal, that I fabricated the facts. I said that I was a liar, that I did not fabricate the facts. I said that I was a criminal, that I invented the most absurd details. I said that I was a criminal, that fabricated the details so perfectly, that it was almost painful to look at them.

All this was true. But something more, more fragile, as well. I used to think that the secrets of our success could not be known, that it is better to persist in the falsehood and allow the guilty men enjoy the spoils of war and prosperity, than to expose the folly and punish the inventors. I used to think that the only way to save the world is to abolish the feints and subterfuges of the guilty, to have the inventors tried and punished in the true sense of the word. I used to think that it is better to die than to admit that there is a God, that the world has a beginning, that there is a name.

Dialog. The author has translated it (with minor alterations) from the French of Jacques Reboul.

"The first chapter is concerned with a machine which is perfectly simple, yet produces infinite series. The second, on a similar machine, produces a series which is infinite in some places and short in others. Each of these machines compels us to a new line of inquiry. I have said that the end justifies the means. The first machine proves that the means is valid. The second machine proves that the means is valid in two different places. Let us consider, for example, the case of the revolving sphygmians. Each sphinx has two faces; the left one shows the number of days it lasts; the right one shows the number of hours that it completes. Let us imagine that the machine is a palace where the sphinxes dwell; the number of days is twelve and the number of hours thirty-three. Let us also imagine that the machine is complete; we shall have twelve steps corresponding to the twelve faces of the sphinx, thirty-three corresponding to the thirty-third days of the year, and so on to the hundredth. The machine then completes by completing itself. We shall then have twelve screens corresponding to the twelve faces of the machine, thirty-three screens corresponding to the thirty-three hours of screen time, and so on to the one thousandth. This machine proves that the means ― to complete the machine ― is valid. Now, there are certain problems which demand an infinite combination of operations. For example, there is the problem of finding the shortest path between two alternatives which are equal. It is true that the shortest path is not infinite, just as the number one is not infinite; nevertheless, it is infinite. If we consider the path corresponding to the eleventh option, we find that it leads to the place corresponding to the twelfth; this place corresponds to the palace where the sphinxes dwell. We shall now consider the path corresponding to the hundredth option. This path leads to the place corresponding to the one thousandth option. Let us imagine that the machine is complete, and we shall be able to perceive it.

"Now, the hypothesis I have set forth does not contradict the data; it proves the data. Let us consider ― what is the most natural thing to do? ― the first machine. We shall say that the work of ten days and nights produces a machine which produces ten works
====================
Dialog.

There are several points to be noted here. The first is that the quotation occurs in a work which contains a large number of similar passages. The second is that the passages are identical. The third is that the earliest date is c. 240; the second is that the first reference is to a volume of the Zohar, the third to the Zohar's translation of the first volume of the Sepher Yezirah; the fourth is that the Zohar's commentary, like that of the Prophet (Allah know unto eternity), transcends the pages of a manuscript, the pages of the prison cell, the pages of the learned, the pages of the unlearned, the pages of every tongue, every tongue and every page. The Zohar, a Zohar, a Zohar, a Zohar, a Zohar, a Zohar, a Zohar, a Zohar, a Zohar, a Zohar, a Sephiroth ― these names, these phrases, these signs and symbols, are not some ephemeral composition; they have a significance which transcends the possible. They are not accidental; they are meant to point to a Divine Plan. But most of all, they are meant to point to the mystery of man.

The fourth point is perhaps the most important. It is the one which the reader may not have noticed. I have said that the "Zohar" of St. John of the Cross is not a mere name for a work of that name, but a symbolic representation of the work. This triple significance ― symbolic, intellectual, and practical ― is the peculiarity which distinguishes the work of Ibn Ezra from all others of that name. Others are mere names; his are an intellectual representation of the book of Ezra, a physical representation of the book of the same name which form the Ark of the Covenant. Men's knowledge and preconceptions are represented by mere names.

That name is St. John of the Cross. One of the principal sciences of the infidels consists in picturing and name-dropping. They talk of the Trinity, which they take to be a synonym for God; they speak of the Son, who must also be the Father; they speak of the Spirit, one indivisible Spirit, one name, one function. They imagine that God knows what is good and what is bad, right and wrong
====================
Dialog or the Greek Hermetic philosophers. Heraclitus related that a river of water which, while running along two parallel bars of iron, could be seen from every side, was thought to have some secret source; that the origin of this source was in Heraclitus, who knew that the iron which supported the stream ran along his chest, and that the source of the iron was in him. The Hermetic philosophers knew that the universe is a secret book which teaches us everything. They knew that the history of the universe is a secret book which teaches us everything. They knew that the chain of causes and effects constitutes, through a labyrinth of diversions, a secret book which teaches us everything. These things have been said and written by men; it is sufficient to recall their words and deeds and observe certain symbols.

One of the chief arts of Peripatetic lore is the elaboration of labyrinths. The best known labyrinth is the one which Socrates constructed for the blind. He had them wander about a circular and very pleasant city, with its quadrangles and restaurants, its black and white television sets, its tenement squares and gladiatorial games. They were told that a god lived in a certain part of the city, that this god guards this labyrinth, and that if anyone enters the labyrinth he will die fighting for his life against this divine assailant. Socrates enacted this labyrinth, and I repeat that it is as yet unimagined to the exclusion of others, because it would seem scarcely probable that a blind man should have to endure a labyrinth composed primarily of things which in themselves are agreeable and which in some way mark him. . . It is impossible to go through the labyrinth without coming across some feature of the city which prompts one to seek after this labyrinth, and which also serves to mark and inform him.

Another important man of that period thoughtfully composed his labyrinth. It is as yet unimagined to the exclusion of others, because it seems scarcely probable that a blind man should have to endure a labyrinth composed primarily of things which in themselves are agreeable and which in some way mark him.

Another important man of that period conceived the idea of constructing a labyrinth to find the source of the blinding light which nearly extinguished his chariot. The idea, if it exists, was brilliant. The men of that period exerted themselves skillfully. They found a formula which, when applied to real situations, would yield a methodical approximation to

Trotsky defined the ideology of Stalinism as that system of thought in philosophy which holds that reality is an abstraction from the concrete practices and concepts of man. In other words, it holds that all theoretical reflection is a distortion of reality. This is what Trotsky wrote about nihilism.

In your essay, you quote from the work of Gustav Landauer. I think you have in mind an aspect of existential existentialism which preaches that all phenomena are abstractions or approximations of the Absolute. Perhaps you know of an earlier and more primitive form of this kind?

I do not know if you have come across it, but this idealist school of thought maintains that all forms of reality – physical, mental, emotional – are merely spatial representations of some higher level of reality. The world is perceived as consisting of a field or texture called the "tissue," which is composed of matter and energy, or energy and void. Each of these voids possesses a certain surface, or "energy field," which serves to reflect or refract the void. All forms then are mental maps of this energy field. All maps are false because the subject of the map is always false. All maps are true, however, because their representation is not an incoherent whole but a coherent whole in its entirety. All maps are therefore rational, Kantian, but not in the sense of senseless but rather in the sense of rational insofar as it regards a mistake as certain. All maps are therefore Cartesian, but not in the sense of false but rather in the sense of false insofar as it regards a mistake as certain. A Cartesian map is a false map. An erroneous map is a false state. [Emphasis added.]

In other words, you say that the classic Cartesian map is a false map and an erroneous state. From these two images it is clear that the Cartesian map is an erroneous state. I do not know if you have come across the most celebrated of these erroneous states, namely, that of Zeno of Elea. But you will recall that the doctrine of the consistency of motion, which you expounded in your article "The Relation of Space and Motion to the Relation of Mind to Mind," was also an erroneous state.

Consider, for example, the famous sentence you wrote: "Any two stones placed side by side will not only get to the center of the earth, which is obvious, they will also

The Adversary speaks English,

I speak Japanese.

In the years between the close of World War I and the outbreak of World War II, a novel language ― this one, singular and free, unmistakably Japanese ― was being born in Japan. This birth had been induced, in large measure, by war. Before the war Japan had codified almost all aspects of her existing civilization; afterwards, during the war, it was necessary to improvise new institutions and to improvise them well. Japan had been conquered and then regenerated thousands of years earlier; it was impossible to erase or lightly modify the traumatic memory that was the war. The new language had to be Japanese in character and in structure; it had to echo not only the script it superseded, but also those aspects of the former script it greatly imitated; it had to evoke from the language's sources those aspects of the Japanese language peculiar to that language which the recasting of time had filtered into the written word. Thus the languages of Shinto and Buddhism had to be recovered; the Syriac alphabet, the Aramaic orthography, the Sanskrit numerals ― these aspects of the war had to be inserted into the language.

The Adversary, like all things Japanese, was multiform and multifaceted; its Japanese, uniform and uniform. In its various guises, it was a king, a priest, a merchant, a shepherd, a warrior, a merchant prince, a knight, a mistress, a dupioni, a maté, a mourir, a aperol, a maté de créer, a maté de lin (each panel denoted a distinct companion of the japanese art object at hand), a maté de vermilion, a maté de romania, a maté de terefa, a

Dialog and the Arabic dialectic that characterize his fanciful and often disgusting romantic writings, to the point of absurdity. I do not mean that these words and this style are absurd; on the contrary, I only mean that they are no longer, in the light of the philosophical problem at our disposal, absurd.

Consider, for instance, the following passage from the Encyclopaedia Britannica: "In the Garden of Forking Paths (or Saraporina) there is a tree which, when it is cut down, throws away its fruit three times over; this miracle has been attributed to the Orphic priest Hermes Trismegistus. The disciple of Zarathustra, Nils Graveser, believes that the same divine hand causes the division of the world's tapers to this day. He speaks of a God who is infinite, of a Trinity, of a labyrinth which dissects through three concentric levels and of three or four known times when the division was perfect."

Graveser's article is a refutation of the idea that there is a third division of the time series, according to which the years 2000, 2001 and 2002 repeat themselves, according to the lunar calendar. Graveser does not dispute that "the Trinity," as applied to the universe, "means three things: one, an invisible, powerful, invisible Father, Son and Holy Spirit; two, a visible, solid, invariable Father, Son and Holy Spirit; three, an invisible, strong and invariable Holy Spirit." He merely counters that since the Son is impersonal and indeterminate, it is insufficient to speak of a personal, invisible and eternal Father for three consecutive centuries ― periods which would fall within the horizons of the tolerably numerous and perfectly indifferent months of a human year ― for us to make such a claim.

I do not know if Graveser understands the problem, but I do know that a time series is a collection of successive events that are ordered so as to form a definite linear progression. In other words, the form of a line is the order in which the branches appear. If the three years 1952, 1953 and 1954 ― which would fall within the last month of a human year ― were unordered, the writer's questioner would be forced to speak of an "incomplete" or "mistransient" line, not of a "perfect" or "mistakable" line.

Dialogical barks, he was almost always already dead.

I do not know whether he had ever mentioned the "Toledo of the poets" or not. Perhaps he remembered a certain Averroes who had written a tragedy in the Latinate called Il Memoria di Averroismo (The Memory of an Illusion), or perhaps he had read it and wanted to ridicule it, but the irony of it all is that in that satire of an opera, the memory of an illusion was the author, and in the author, the memory of an illusion. I do not know whether he ever saw the first draft of the present work, because it was always a secret work, and the preparation was concealed.

In the reign of Henry XI., my father used to say to me: "You know, you don't know jack about Jack the Ripper; you know what he is." And I would say to him: "What is Jack the Ripper?" "He is the habit he grew up with, the habit of murdering people, of concealing the crime, of sending out his enemies to kill him, so he won't have to see it, so he won't know what to do with it."

I only wish I could tell you what my father's death meant to me. I never knew him to be cruel, but I know he was cruel to a fault. I never understood how it was that he was able to endure so many years, so hard work, and yet be so unutterably simple-minded. I know I was taught that my father was a hard worker, but I don't know if I remember that he was a carpenter's mate, a boy who had toiled away under such oppressive conditions, under such terrible eyes.

There is nothing new under the sun here; the book has been around for a century and a half, and the title page is just another example of the intellectual decay that has afflicted popular literature in the United States in recent years.

I don't know whether I have described the plot perfectly, but I suspect that I have left it open to the reader's imaginations. I also don't know whether I have tried to give the reader a true picture of the novel ― an accurate picture, perhaps, of the novel itself. I believe that I have tried to do so. I am certain that not all of the events described by the novel happened. I am certain that I have left out crucial details. I am certain that the novel was written with different eyes than those of those who embraced it.

It is natural that I should try to summarize the novel in a few words, because a well-crafted paragraph will take less time to write than an unsuccessful one. I shall try to do so, however, as well as attempt to summarize the novel in a few words, so as to make it easier for us to remember it. If I am unsuccessful in doing so, I shall try again some time in the future.

I. THE CONCEPTION OF TIME

I believe that the first philosophical problem that Plato tried to solve was the origin of time. He asked: Who is he that can speak of an infinite series of times, of an infinite series of spatial objects? He wondered if it were possible for an immeasurably intelligent being to make such a series. Time, he asked, is a form of perception: if it were a sensible thing, it would have to be something present, something perceptible; but it is a mental state arising from ideas, a mental state deduced from the verbal statements that produce it. To ask who is capable of deducing an infinite mental state from a verbal statement, and to ask why, and how long ago, and at what places, is not sufficient: we also need an infinite statement, a statement of all possible states of the world, so that our mental state, which is posited in a certain state, is not a mere appearance. Plato proposed that the name of the mental object be unique, so that no one, not even himself, can mistake it in the course of reasoning.

The Shape of the Sword



The forms of the word are not very difficult to translate. They would be "swords, hilted and crowned" or "threefold hilted hilts" or something like that. The forms of the word are more difficult. The first two, "of the Lake," are easier, "of the Lake and itslements," and "of the Lake and its elements," are more difficult. The third, "of the Lake and its elements in these elements," is perfectly unknown. The "shape of the sword" is almost imperceptible, but it must be that the "swords" and the "hilts" and the "hindrances" and the "oranges" and the "leaves" are one single real thing. I think this is what Jesus meant when He said (Matthew 11:19): "You are gates, John! But the things which people name, I call Lake and Elements and September and I am one Stone."

Dialog (the last clause of which I shall quote presently); for it is certain that the idea of the following sentence did not enter his head: "The society of Borges is a sham."

Clementina Villar died on February 9, 1873. I spent the night with her in an apartment on the rue de Toulon. We spoke of everything, but perhaps the most interesting subject was Jorge Luis Borges. I mentioned that he had written the work La jardice des camps," which had a vast effect on the history of philosophy; he told me that he had not intended it to become a book, that it was natural for him to compose stories "which, although they percolate through his mind, never leave the page" (quoted in Barrionueva, pp. 404). He added that he considered it a blessing that "the book which he has just translated, the ze slurchel, or tome on the eighteenth century military tactics, has already done more to facilitate the understanding of students of military and naval history than all the literatures put together." He added that he considered that the work ought to be compulsory reading for all high school students, and that if possible simultaneously with the first edition.

I had expected him to complain that he did not receive any recognition for his labors, or to compare his earnings with those of the preachers who used to flock to the pulpits to receive crosses on their doors and phone books in Spanish that said "Jesus loves you" (or "Jesus loves Telethronik" or "Jesus loves Telethronik," etc.). Instead, he expressed his gratitude "for the privilege of having contributed to the work La jardice des camps." He told of the first time he had opened his letter and saw the famous words: "This book has inspired generations of warriors and philosophers." He related how, several days later, he had carried the letter to the card game Mercureus, and there had won a bet with the following number: -- "Two and one-half to go!"

Then he recalled the letter from God; and while the light of day continued to shine through the window, he again saw the words, this time in brighter relief: "This book has inspired generations of assassins and gurus."

He told of the second time he had opened the letter, which had been like a shock for him. He had opened the first letter because

He recalled, for example, the case of a young man who, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, took a vow of poverty; the poverty, he said, made him indifferent to the life of a miser; the life of a miser, indifferent to the life of an anglo. . . One afternoon, I know of a young woman who, on seeing the "world," gave up her former trade as a silversmith and became, for the first time in her life, able to appreciate the infinite. . . The self, the world, the things, the universe, are but symbolic images; the attainment of absolute happiness consists in substituting one's being for that of the world, in substituting one's being for that of everything. . . The world is a delusion; the Buddha promises to free us from it.

The sage's life ― such, I believe, is the ordinary pattern of all men's lives ― is like that of a common cobbler whose skill increases inexorably the more intricate and imperfect his looms are exposed to the elements. The master eventually tires of his craft, his hands bleed from continually untangling the loom, his hands ache from untangling the intricate web of chance connections that is the human body. The body, after all, is a passive thing, a passive instrument capable of many actions at once mental and physical. The sage's skill with his hands, his skill with a loom, were rendered obsolete by the death of his mentor. The events of the past few days seem to me to be the effects of one mind, which, in the course of a few uninterrupted hours, annihilated the body and created a new mental world out of the material world. I understand that the world this world will endure; if so, what kind of world will that world be?

Dialog or other language. The solitary observer of the cosmos, it is true, is exposed to the influences of chance, but the Bible teaches that chance can never completely take possession of fate. Chance, in the hands of Satan, will always be more potent than God. The Bible, in so many words, assures us that we are endowed with free will; if our destiny is determined by chance, how can we be certain that we do not act under the influence of something more powerful, more permanent, more intimate than ourselves? The mystical writings of all time testify to an ancient universal, a cosmic order, in which all are gods, or at least that order is reflected in the universe. The spheres or firmament is conceived as a kind of jeweled prison, impenetrable to the ordinary plane. The mystical books predict that the first person to penetrate to the outside world will realize that order is best reflected in the firmament, and that, therefore, he will strive to achieve that order on the part of all who will allow themselves to be influenced by him. This cosmic order, this order of eternal repose, is the secret power which determines the course of all events. The odds are against, the nightmarish and prodigious drama of chance invariably unfolds in the center of the plane, where the divinity is said to dwell. The central place, the invisibility of the immemorials, the perfect invulnerability of the faithful, have saved this mysterious order from the perils of the realistic world. A Most Worshipful God Who Is Unknown, The Doctrine of the Universe, Compendium of the Faith, De septima ratioe, II, NPN, 1812 This order, which in time has been called the "great knot of the world" or the "web of the universe" and has been represented by such figures as Jesus, Moses, Buddha and Mohammed, is incomprehensible to the hands of chance. But it is also, according to the Book of Acts, "vexed with perils" and is the work of seven heads, which means that seven distinct operations are required for its undoing. This doctrine, which has spread so widely in the centuries since the time of Paul and the Council of Nicaea, states that the whole universe (or a great many-faceted part of it) is comprised in a field or sphere called the "fourth sphere" or "sphere of seven heads." The field has seven concent

Dialog (in Japanese)

Funes is one of the last of the old guard, a traditionalist who rejected the post of general. He was the first to declare that the war against Japan was not only inevitable but also necessary. He was quick to favor the use of poison gas against the Japanese, who were oblivious to the weapon. He opposed the call-up of volunteers for the Chinese civil war, believing that such a measure would inflame the Chinese against the Japanese and that the Japanese would retaliate with conscription. In October 1946, fearing a repeat of the disastrous mutiny of the Haihong, he resigned from the nationalist party and headed my party, the first object of his impetuosity and of his jealousy.

When our guerillas routed the Japanese at Shanghai on March 13, I was then city mayor. Time and again our guerillas were routed by the superior numbers of the Tokyo garrison; I, unable to rely upon the irregular battalions, ordered the formation of an all-star infantry company. To this end, I took Lieutenants Araki and Inoue as officers, and they came from all parts of the Empire to take up the challenge.

We began our preparations in earnest, first in the offices of the Sate Insurance Company. From this public company we obtained insurance against personal injury and against accidental damage to private property. In addition, we obtained policy limits and reserves. Our basic policy allowed us, during a single year, to insure against Canso, 1876, Tokyo, 1946; to insure against all public buildings in the city, 1911; to insure against bridges and tunnels, 1929; to insure against all fixtures and fittings in a house, 1933; to insure against a coin, 1946; to insure against the performance of legal obligations, 1953. Our policy limits, which had varied from time to time doubled to double the limits prescribed by the company. These doubled limits allowed us to provide for the contingencies of unforeseen developments. In particular, we were enabled to insure against the contingency that the performance of legal obligations would be suspended for one month. This suspension would allow us time to prepare legal proceedings during which the legal obligation would be obeyed. This delayed suspension of the legal obligation also permitted us the opportunity to investigate the legal implications of the legal obligation. In other words, the period of suspension permitted us to investigate the legal implications of the legal obligation, which allowed us the opportunity to investigate the
====================
Dialog; only one word, Arithmetic, was used. The first reader of it made a mistake; the second, not so much. There was a contradiction in the name of the man; in the second man.

The first man was a Chaldean; the second a Roman. A man of God, of the East; of Arabia; of Egypt; of the other planets; of the universe; of Maimonides. I know him; I admire him; I love him; but I do not share his antipathy toward all numbers. He refused to accept the Latin numeral one; he insisted that four was an inadequate representation of infinite number. He also insisted that ten was insufficient representation of infinite number. I understand him to have subscribed to the notion that there are no such things. I have known him simple; I know he valued long and logical sentences. I understand him now to have become irreligious and hostile. I had hoped that his detestation of the concept of ten might have led him to the aid of reason; instead, it has led him to the aid of the Latin numeral one.

He has also betrayed the least of us by his impiety. Like the pagans of old, he sought the idol of his own choosing; like them, the number of his idols is infinite. The universe, with its countless numbers, cannot be significant of an atom. It is no accident that the first words uttered by Jesus ― "face it out" ― were those of his opponent. The Jew sees in the universe a receptacle where abstract causes and effects may mix freely; the Christian sees in the universe a school of objects where concrete causes and effects must be firmly rooted.

The consequence of this dichotomy is, perhaps, not surprising. The medieval Christian believed in a personal God; the barbarian a causal and destructive God. The barbarian, in order to fulfill his destiny, needed a god capable of conjuring up his calamities. The Christian, in order to fulfill his destiny, needed a god capable of conjuring up his calamities. The result was, first, an inversion of the superstitions of the land and, second, an inversion of the Christian religion as well.

The nominal inversion is pernicious. It turns the terms in which a god is invoked into talismans; it turns the divine into an impersonal cause; it turns the world of contingency and chance into the

The manuscript is divided into four parts. The first describes the practice of the time of the dead, the second the ritual of initiation, the third the ritual of silence, the fourth the ritual of the Amulet of Quiriona. The Amulet of Quiriona is a long, narrow chain with four faces and is part of the "great helm" worn by the inhabitants of Umbria. (This name is a play on the words of Tennyson: the "h Helm of Tennyson " covers many things; it is the phrase, "He who sits atop a throne of swords , needs a sword of war to dot the blue field.") The first four letters of the name Quirianthe are identical in sound with those of the name Quixote; the fifth letter, f, is the Latin for "I." The "h" in Quixote stands for "hunting," and the "v" for victory. The Quixote was a very difficult work; its author died before completing it. (The detailed history of his death is given in the appendix to this volume.) The first four chapters deal with the origin and history of the people of Umbria. These people are a development of the Celts of the Iliad; they speak and act in a very nearly parallel manner, though without the triumphal pomp and ending with a sword. They live in compact communities, follow very similar rituals, and regard the end of their history as the beginning of theirs again. (They do not desire the resurrection; they desire immortality.) They have the face, the tongue, the blood; they do not wish the robe to remain, nor do they wish for it to be replaced by another. They do not desire the splendors of the mirror, nor the opulence of the court. . . They desire to be forgotten. They desire to be forgotten as easily as they desire to be loved. They desire to be forgotten more than they desire to be loved. (Their customs, their language, their arts,

Of course, the most difficult passages are those which can be simplified or eliminated, but in general, the more abstract the problem, the greater the difficulties; and, in the last analysis, the easier the problem, the more abstract it will be. I recall one of my former students, M. Amorim, who wrote as follows: "If we imagine a garden divided into equal parts arable and non-arable land, with a fence separating the former and a stone wall separating the latter, let us say ten centimeters high and five centimeters wide, with a stone triangle, ten centimeters in diameter and five centimeters thick, which when touched emits a faint vibration which is the triangle's semi-dissolving power gives us for the distance from A to B ten centimeters and a half plus ten centimeters." This simple image, with its ten centimundo vibrations, could be reduced to a number of formulas or metaphors which could then be used to solve the enigma. Thus M. Amorim solved it:

Fact: (1) Physics states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction; therefore (2) there is an absolute space whose center is at the instant of an action.

The World and the Librarian



The first impression of the world is the impression of a classless and consequently anonymous world, in which the particulars of every individual's life are absorbed. We are then no longer individuals but aggregates of aggregates, agents of an infinite law which does not intervene between us and those aggregates. The world thus becomes the library, the collections, the rows of shelves, the innumerable volumes, the incomprehensible and inconceivable books. There is no empire, no state, no religion, no time, in the insatiable and ever shifting web of books. The innumerable digitized works of Shakespeare, of Beckner, of Carpentras, of Beckner, of Turgenev, of Beckner, constitute not a single historical epoch, but a vast and ever-shifting labyrinth.

The Permanent Revolution



In spite of the fact that I am no longer able to read or write very well, it is certain that I am much more flexible than I used to be. The cause is not external; I can eliminate painful movements or words. My hand no longer aches anymore; my fingers no longer break when I try to raise an object up; all of these changes have taken place unconsciously. My brain no longer calculates or arranges things mathematically; it generates them naturally. All this can be said of me. I don't need to hide it, but I see clearly now, almost as if they had been there all along, in a glass jar under my fingernails.

The Second Period



I

I had a dream on the 2nd of September, 1920, in which I no longer remember my room and my family. The name of the wall behind me was Claudia Paulista; I recognized its wall-covering portrait, the artist's own: Vladimir Konovalov. The room smelled good to me; the heavy rain had quieted down. The artist said that he had painted this room because he was lonely and that I would find out why I was here. I told him my purpose.

The following morning I found myself in what was then called the second

Dialogical notes" and "pseudo notes" on the box.

"It is a travesty that we should have to invent a writer like him," I read. "How can we hope to fill the pages of life with human beings whose real characteristics are not so many in number as those of the symbol?"

The next morning I read that, in the ranks of literature, that of the Puerto Rican is the least despicable. The authors of Creole literature are very numerous, but the Puerto Ricans are very few in number. The theory which I have advanced may seem absurd; the fact is that the Puerto Ricans are not very numerous, and the Puerto Ricans do not really belong to any one author. They belong to the Quintana de Viser books of Borges; they belong to the Tale of the Two Cities; they were dictated by Diosdado Pérez Murillo. . .

At first I avoided the subject, lest the thought of offending some one against my modesty should have disturbed me. I remember a conversation with a Puerto Rican friend of ours, during which he related that the Puerto Rican is one who, when he finishes a book, wipes away the tears that flow from its innocent blue-and-white canvas and prays that God may send him many years of fruitful and tender years. Another friend related that the Puerto Rican is an old man who, on arriving at the end of a work, places the finished book side by side before his eyes and cries out, "I have just seen God!"

I do not know whether I have caused offense with my narration; perhaps I am deluded and see in the past, in which we live in continuous chains of dreams, the true foundation of things. Perhaps the truth is that things happen to Puerto Ricans in a cyclic and reflex manner, that each of us, through a series of dreams, arrives at the form he finds most readily satisfactory. This cyclic nature of things, this uniform rhythm of their events, does not interest Puerto Ricans. Instead they prefer, as far as life is concerned, abrupt and chaotic acts. For Puerto Ricans, a picture is an assemblage of objects arranged in a homogeneous fashion; for ordinary people, an idea is an arrangement of unrelated objects arranged in such a manner that the spectator has as much or as little as he pleases. It is well known that the Puerto Rican believes in two centuries of

This question is analyzed in Léon Bloy, "Le monde numérique," Les Etablissements International, November 1943, part II, where, in an article on Arthur Schopenhauer, he writes: "The greatest of German Idealists, Schopenhauer, understood well the Jewish problem; the other problem was the problem of naming the problem. Schopenhauer thought: I will name it the Problem of Jewish Goodness; others, the problem of the magic number assigned to every world. . . The problem to which Schopenhauer dedicated his life was not the Jewish problem, not the Anglo-Saxon problem, but the universal problem: the problem of naming all the complex interrelated facts that make up the continuous world."

====================
Dialog: "Whatever you did in the night, I did not do." The very fact that he could state this, could conclude it, was a miracle. The night had been too terrible for this kind of lucidity.

I remember a certain man who was a national hero in our country. He was a fighter in the last war; he died in a burning village, on account of ailing spirits. Those who knew him understood that he could not live like this and that he was of great value to the movement. One night he said to himself: "I know I am sick and weak, but I am going to Heaven and I will live like the Picassos and die like Jesus." He went out into the street and at last fell sick and died. No one could say why; some spirit of that night had foreseen it or could have foreseen it.

I know of a certain methodical doctor who, beginning several times with the subtle and almost useless art of curing sick people, finally resorts to the most atrocious and infamous remedies. These remedies are said to have been discovered by St. John of Kronstadt and are as follows:—

First, amputation of the foot and hand.

Second, Conception in the sea.

Third, Obliteration of the hostile gods.



I have considered with stupor the art of treating sick people. It seems to me that the sick people should be easy to treat; the ill people, difficult. Let us imagine two ill people ― a blind man and a lunatic child ― and let us assume that they talk to us, but that they do not communicate. Let us imagine that the former or blind man has a clock in his room, the latter has it in his power to die at any moment. Let us imagine that the latter can be brought to the point at which it is reasonable to suppose him capable of making a rational choice. Let us imagine that on the fourth day he is brought back from the brink.

My colleague and I would do well to ponder these possibilities. I would choose the latter, since it is certain that the former or "impossible" will at some point in time prove to be possible.

Let us consider another example. Let us suppose that I have determined to become a lawyer. I begin by trying to imagine what it would be like to be another person, to be another human being. If my

Dialog, the most ancient of alphabets, the one which gave rise to the Latin alphabet; at the time of the battle of Lepanto, the emperor was Quintus Aeternus; he was a sharp-featured man with gray eyes. He was also, I remember, a man of letters. He confided to me one of his secrets, the story of how he came by his initials. He had them inscribed on a Roman numeral in an emperor's edict; those initials, I repeat, were not of Quintus Aeternus; they were of a very ancient man, a forerunner of Diocletian. . . Lavinia, the wife of a praetor, had me sign a confession which I was certain I understood. She was a Venetian by birth, but her blood ran cold in the Greek god; she came from a northern quarter, from the most isolated and humble of Italian cities, Vercelli, in the Umbrian quadrangle. Vercelli was not known for its magnificence, but it was famous for its baroque poetry, its art deco buildings, its uncompromisingly conservative tastes in all things artistic. Vercelli was also, as is natural, a sorcerer. He had rediscovered in Vercelli the lost alphabets which had been lost in that benighted city; those ancient letters which Jean Genet had deciphered but which the city officials did not yet possess. Genet had incorrectly sought them on a red-brick page in a lost book by Shakespeare; Vercelli had discovered, through the laborious labor of one Jean-Baptiste Vergennes, the eighty or so sacred letters which, through cunning and death, gave voice to the dynamic being who wrote The Tempest and On The Cross.

Genet's exploration was premature; Vergennes's discovery was already standard practice in the baroque studies of that era. (In the present one, I have employed the name of Vercellinus.) Yet the fact that Vergennes chose to base his discovery on a baroque city, rather than on London or Paris, was significant. Perhaps the designation of Vercellinus signaled to the reader, not Vercardi, but rather Vercard: this reader expected to penetrate Vergil's thought, this reader expected him to be as capable of conjuring up The Tempest as he was of writing
====================
Dialog.

"He was a man of letters," I heard Mrs. Hendershot say. "He never knew if what he was writing was true or not. He would compare the different versions of an event and then decide which version was most probable. He was a man of letters, but a man of letters only in an informal sense. He preferred conversation. He used to read a little poetry or a little fiction and then debate the points in great circles. He never lost his reason, but he always felt that what others were thinking he ought to be doing as well. I don't remember whether we ever discussed suicide."

The evening papers were in a frenzy. The Times declared: "Frederick Douglass: A Man of the World." The Nation devoted a page to the "imminent" trial of Frederick Douglass. The Independent declared: "Frederick Douglass to Stand Trial for Rebellion." The Austin Chronicle declared: "Frederick Douglass to Stand Trial for Rebellion." The San Jacinto Review declared: "Frederick Douglass to Be Sentenced to the Bar." The Omaha World-Herald gave the name of Eugene V. Debs. Douglass had been designated by the judges of the Nebraska state court to make an analogous argument against a military commission, but he had instead been selected by the judges of the federal court of inquiry to give a similar argument against a court of laws. The latter had, instead, awarded him to the former. The judges had not impugned his sincerity, his patriotism, his justice; they had impugned his ability to give such an argument.

In the spring of 1914 I visited Eugene V. Debs in his home on Long Island. We had conversed many a while before, on horseback; now we walked through the parks, along the waterfronts, through the congested squares. We stood together in semicircles, like some invisible acquaintance; then, he placed his elbows on the armrests of the back of the vehicle, as if he were going to fall asleep; then, he relaxed them a little, as if he were ready to fall asleep.

I asked him about the famous case of the shoe merchant who sent his customers' money in exchange for a piece of worthless leather. Mr. Debs related the following story: One Saturday in 1872, my uncle Cornelius and his companion Silvio Leonora visited this "barbarous" merchant,

Dialog

The rudiments of the dialect are thus:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

The syntax of the dialect is thus:

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

and the semantics is thus:

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

a b c d e f g i j k l m o q r s t u v w x y z

without loss of generality.

We propose that the following conditions be fulfilled:

a) the discourse should not be a part of the universal or of the local tradition;

b) it should not be of a local character;

c) it should not conflict with the tradition;

d) it should not conflict with other traditions;

e) it should not conflict with the philosophical traditions of the Dialectical Materialist school.

We have considered only the first of these conditions. It suffices here only to make a general observation. If all the verbal products of thought are of a local character, the local tradition does not have to contest them here. If, on the other hand, they all contest one another, the local tradition will not be able to convince itself that they do not conflict. We have already seen (Trotsky, Dialectics, II, 108) that the problem of the relationships inherent in ideas is one which local traditions can tackle head on, without the need of philosophical incursions. It suffices here also to add that the dialectic here acts as a presumption against local traditions. If one product ― word, idea, symbol ― of thought is local, all products will be subject to its influence. If, on the other hand, one symbol ― a slogan, a symbol of some kind ― is local, all products will be influenced by it. The local idea, the dialectic shows, is not a mere formal one, but a more fundamental one. It is that of a kingdom without a king, of men without the divine right of kingship.

The dialectic thus establishes itself. It establishes its unchallengeable place at the head of the great universal problem. It establishes a

Dialog in the Desert (1798). The first volume is the practical, the second the sentimental. The latter is the more important, but it is also anachronistic. The influence of Rousseau is obvious.

In the second volume of the first series, Lönnrot introduces a theory of rhetoric which he calls "the dialectical reason of Leibniz" and which he assigns to an unknown Germanic thinker (not to Russell or Husserl). In the first issue of the monthly Review (vol. 3, March 1949), Lönnrot mentions the theory of Russell and assigns it to the same person.

I believe that the author of the third edition of the Basic Law (1953) was the first one. It is also known that he tried to harmonize the fundamental principles of Lönnrot's natural philosophy with those of the dialectic of Alfred North Whitehead (1923). In the first volume of the first volume of Notes Toward a System of Religions (1953) he tried to accomplish the same thing. I do not know whether his "ultimate" theory is a synthesis of the two or not.

In any case, the theory I have indicated — the one based on Russell's philosophy of language (or, if you prefer, on Russell's notion of a notion of a notion of a notion)) — is the one which the abominable North Whitehead attempted. I do not know whether Whitehead succeeded in harmonizing these different aspects of his being. I know that his failure is of no importance. To suggest that it hindered or limited Whitehead is, in my judgment, an act of sacrilege. I judge that the work performed by North Whitehead is "pure" and am happy to recognize him as such. I judge that John William S. Lind (1907-1966) is "undivided" and can "stand in any spot on the face of the planet." I judge that Bach's Seventh Symphony (drama number four) is "pure" and can be sung "without reservation without fail." I judge that Whitehead's theory of "pure music" is "pure" and that his definition of "soul" in the Ninth Symphony is "a pure conception of the sacred." I judge that Bach's Ninth Symphony (drama number six) is "pure" and that it constitutes the "sole pure work of the universe." I judge that Bach

Dialog" of Leibniz. (This letter, unpublished until now, is, as far as I know, the first of its kind.) It is a cipher, a symbolic one, a form of tautology which sounds formal while indicating the complete absence of irony or sarcasm. This tautology, like that of the greek and of all the other languages spoken in Peru, is antiquated and degraded. It is time and psychology at their worst. The "paragraph" is one long description of the Amazon, of the fauna and flora of that vast and mysterious continent. The prose is brief and the symbolism elementary. In the preface to this letter we read that the Lorente family emigrated with their three children from Cordova in 1868. The Lorente who settled in Querétaro were of Spanish stock, but their great-grandfather, Alejandro Lorente, was of Quechua stock. At the time of the family migration the Quechua word for river was springs and the Cholula the house at its head. The house was on the southern bank of the Amazon; the Lorente who settled there were exactly like any other Quechua family in the interior of the country. The children were well fed; the house was in good repair; the Lorentes were contented and happy inhabitants of a tranquil region sheltered from the hurricane-ravaged cities and from the deadly jungles. The Quechua word for "river" was Cataractes and for "house" was the old colonial palace; the children played in peace and learned to distinguish between the grass and the mud. The climate was temperate; the children attended public schools; the Lorente landowners were moderate in their treatment of the strikers. The children's suffering was normal. The teachers, who included representatives of the provincial and national education Departments, were unanimous in recommending the education of children of the future Lorentes. Among the laws they recommended was one which mandated that all children learn the history and forms the unity of all the other documents of the nation; this limited government was compatible with the profoundest feelings of humanity. The government school system was recommended by many. The national curriculum was recommended by many. In view of the necessities of the struggle against imperialism, the teachers of the schools felt called upon to select a corpus of years so that the children of the future would have this rare opportunity for the transmission of the national

"If we think in terms of a single reality, we commit the gravamen of negligence; for as soon as we think of two realities, we are forced to mention them as mutually exclusive. Furthermore, as soon as we think of a triple reality, we are forced to mention it as a priori."

"The world is made of two elements: the apparent world and the invisible world. The latter is a reflection of the former, or at least of its mirror; the former must be absolute to warrant the mention of it in terms of two absolute realities. Now, the universe is absolute; if we assume it, we shall also be the subject of it. Now, this universe is an infinite discourse, and its interjections are blind; by means of these interjections, the vast object serves only to enliven the meditations of its audience."

"If we imagine a palace, our rooms are made of smooth stone; in them, bookshelf after shelf after shelf of bookshelves oscillates in a millimeter-wide space. Each leaf of a new book we take off, one at a time. In this continuous movement we feel its complete rotation; each new volume we take off we fix on with our eyes. Each rotation produces a new color and a new thought. Every book we take off has, through neglect or perhaps because of neglect, communicated to us a few words which belong to the preceding one. This process, which seems to us simple and on the whole stable, is nothing of the sort. It is outraged by chance and is constantly being disrupted by the accidental: the noise of the rain, the rustle of the grass, the slight fluctuation of the sun's rays. In such a palace, one book would be serving to communicate all the word's shade and nuance; a careless neglect (which hardly ever was) would, through neglect, transmit to us the tiniest fragment of the treasured range."

In the first book of the N. T. V. A. history there is a curious oversight. In the first chapter the author forgets to insert the word "and" and in the second chapter the word "many." We read that Anthony I, in an Englishman's memory, had abolished the centuries in order to abolish a single detail of his life: the custom of celebrating the twelfth of every month with a feast of the gods. The Englishman's memory had preserved this custom throughout the dynasties of the Old World; Anthony I, in an Englishman's memory, abolished it in order to abolish a single detail of his life. The Englishman's memory had preserved this detail throughout the dynasties of the Old World; Anthony I, in an Englishman's memory, had abolished it in order to abolish that detail. A century ago the trouble would not have occurred to me. I recall that the peasants of Cambrai voted with their feet for Anthony I; I recall that the peasants of Cambrai voted for Anthony I, because he was English. If I am not mistaken, many of them still backslope from that assumption. I vote for Anthony I because he is different, because he is incapable of treachery, ignorance, or folly.

Pliny says that in the province of Yunnan Banten (in present-day Gansu) there are certain palimpsests which, though seemingly precise, nevertheless admit of enormous variations. He speaks of a file whose irregularities suggest a nonlinearity which is actually there; this file suggests a kind of chaos, but no chaos can enter into the main one, lest it obscure the endless circular stream which flows through its intersections. The palimpsests are continuous, but their natural order suffocates the successive lines. The Yunnan scholars attribute this circularity to the file's internalizing of the doctrine of circular time, which maintains that the years are not unlimited but limited, that the centuries are discontinuous, but that the years are continuous if they coincide exactly, that is, are produced from a

Dialog:

I am a little possessed of being in the presence of a single beautiful statue. . . (What a variety!) I see it from different distances. . . (I see it now from the same distances as when I left it!) I hear it now as if it were within my reach. . . (I hear it now as if it were yesterday!) I am aware of no fact whatever of the universe. . . (This state of being does not, in fact, last: it is an appearance.)

The spirit of Diodorus Siculus, after a careful study of the Apollodorus, Siciliamnos, and Herculaneus treatises on theaminis, the "tomb," relates that the name is derived from the square of the name and is composed of the twenty-ninth and the twentieth digits. . . It should be added that the author of this quotation, having compared the amanuenses with that of Herculaneus, finds that they agree remarkably closely in this respect.

The following are some examples taken from the works of this sort: Averroes, Book V, Section IV; Horace, De finibus eadem, II, 791; Pliny, Historia naturalis, I, 6; Pliny, Historia logicalis, I, 1; Pliny, Historia attribuitus, I, 13; Pliny, Annals, XLVI, 362; Pliny, Naturalis sciendum, I, 4; Pliny, Annals, XLVI, 380; Zwingli, Mythologiae, I, 49; Zeng, Zhaoming, I, 317; Zunz, Zunlong, IX.

Hermann Hohenzollern, Historische Sprache, declares that the ancients inscribed their names in twenty-four-point hexadecimal, and that in the twenty-four digits of this number they added two zeroes. This assertion, however, presupposes that twenty-four hexadecimal digits are equal; if they were, there would be no need of the second representation, because the two zeroes would cancel out. (Immanuel Maimonides gives as an example twelve-point hexadecimal.) In any case, in the Hebrew alphabet there are infinitely many digits, and if ten are infinity and four zero, as is intuitive

Dialog. In the first place, a dialectical proof of a fact is one which must be, since it is the regular connection of terms which establishes the fact; a proof of a fact which is not a proof at all, but of an appearance which is not an appearance at all. A dialectical proof is one which establishes a relation, a rule; a formal rule is one which is not a rule at all, but a virtual one, such as the one governing the potentiality of a number. A proof is one which establishes a counterrelation, a conjunction: it is a priori necessary that there exist counterreversions of a given inverse. A counterrelation is a term which is not a term of the term which is a posteriori necessary that there exist a priori counterreversions of a given inverse. A conjunction is a term which is a term of the term which is a posteriori necessary that there exist counterreversions of a given inverse. A difference is a term which is a term of the term which is a posteriori necessary that there exist counterreversions of a given inverse. A potency is a term which is a term of the term which is a posteriori necessary that there exist counterreversions of a given inverse. A time is a term which is a term of the term which is a posteriori necessary that there exist counterreversions of a given inverse. A space is a term of the term which is a posteriori necessary that there exist counterreversions of a given inverse. A substance is a term of the term which is a posteriori necessary that there exist counterreversions of a given inverse. A principium is a term which is a term of the term which is a posteriori necessary that there exist counterreversions of a given inverse. A contradiction is a term which is a constituent of a plurality of contradictions.

A Note on the Third Particular of Palamas



The former part of the preceding definition consists in the distinguishing of the mind from the matter of the world; the latter in the distinction of its matter. It is well known that the mind comprehended in these terms is a priori material, and that its matter is a posteriori spiritual. The latter is demonstrated by distinguishing it from the former by means of the method of a priori reason: for the mind, because of its being a priori, it is conceivable;

"You're not interested in words," I said. "You're interested in something more fundamental: the mystery of the universe."

"I don't believe in the universe," he said.

"The mystery of the universe," I repeated. "The whole history of the universe ― the period of time since the Big Bang ― written in symbols."

"In that case," I said, "you don't believe in a single symbol." (Of course, I didn't believe in any single symbol.)

"The universe," he repeated, "isn't a series of symbols."

"It's much more," I said, "an actual being: human beings, in our complex and changing way of being. The universe is a way of seeing ― a way of constructing sentences with verbs and adjectives, of constructing paragraphs with clauses and adverbs, of constructing categories with categories and adlections with adlections and syllogisms with syllogisms and Alphonse Besnard with Chevaliers de Justice with Leclercq with the heavens with their constellations and the water with their mirrors and the sphinxes with their bodies and the black stone with its wards and the incantations with its treasures. That's the universe.)

"The universe is a delusion," he said. "A vain delusion. I don't believe in the universe. I don't believe in any being except myself. I'm a simple-minded man who's deluded himself. My words, his experiences reveal to him the vastity and interconnectedness of the world."

"The world is symbolic," I said. "It reveals itself symbolically to be less a symbolic reality than a symbolic language. The man knows nothing about the world, about himself. He only knows the symbolic world. All his life he's followed another another, another symbol. He knows it because that other knows it. The man who's followed the symbols of a metaphysician doesn't study nor does he care whether he's talking about a real person, he just knows that he's talking about a symbolic person. The man who follows the force of a force I don't even know doesn't care whether he's talking about a real person, he just cares whether I'm talking about a symbolic person. He doesn't care about the man who's really after him. He just knows he has to be talking about another man. The man who

Dialog.These words, however, are of a figurative character. They promise nothing definite; they only suggest a metaphor which is so complete that it is meaningless. I shall try to describe it.

"Fifty years ago," says Bachelier, "I was in the very heart of Paris, in an apartment of a friend of his. I had gone there to consult with him on some problem of geography. I do not remember what I wore; it is known that I was in waistcoat and pointed sandals. At some distant period of the night I woke up very stiff and chilly; I recollect that I perceived a vague outline of a balcony, which rose abruptly from the floor of the corridor. From this balcony I could clearly see the garden; above this garden I perceived a single extremely high high ceiling. Around this garden there was a wide expanse of unripe vegetables, which seemed to me to be naturally sweet; I perceived a window overlooking the garden. From this window I could clearly see a garden in which the least touch could be distinguished; here, in the service of color, did Bachelier perhaps exaggerate the color of the vegetables? Or was he actually put in his place? Or was he really degraded, as all men are, by the prestige of power? Or was he really degraded, as all men are, by the prestige of color? In the course of the day I managed to creep into an upper story; I think that I glimpsed the face of the emperor; I managed to creep up to the solid oak panel which forms the partition between the two stories; I managed to peer out of the crack in the plaster vaults which divide the second from the third stories; I managed, finally, into the two unequal halves of the two thousand and one cubical feet. I think that I perceived, in this last half, the apartment of Funes; I think that I perceived, in this half, the body of Faustina Valera. I think that I perceived a piano, a telegraph, a library, a watch which, despite the rainy season, had not failed to malfunction; I think that I perceived, in this half, a maze which, though it did not diverge perceptibly from the other halves, did diverge conspicuously from the other halves. I think that I perceived a lamp which, though it oscillated between sublimated and continuous torchbeams, nevertheless had the property of producing

Dialog" and the title page of the third volume of his work "Critique of Pure and Applied Linguistics." I shall return to this third volume in due course.

As far as I know, no one has examined the 1790 edition of "Critique of Pure and Applied Linguistics." I know of no one who has searched it, and I know of the like in vain. I am not aware of a single edition, no matter how numerous its volumes may be, that does not contain the first two volumes of Dickson's exposition of the third theory of relativity, published some two centuries ago. This second exposition (imperfect, indeed, but I know) constitutes the basis for Dickson's present theory, which was published in 1801 and which he revised and enlarged in subsequent works.

My knowledge of the various works of Descartes is not very extensive; I know of brief mentions in "The Doctrine of fornication" and "Critique of Pure Reason" and in "De rerum natura" and in "Qualitates" (1961). I do know of works by others. The first of these is "De coelo della storia del sol Ferro" (1866). The second is "The World as Thought" (1904). Both of these works are mere epithets ― quite brief and unpractulous in places ― but they inspire silence and forlornly forswear the pomp of Descartes's "logical prince."

It is useless to repeat that the doctrine I am about to expound is the logical prince. Its antecedents (I, II, III) were excavated in the pages of "Theorie politique" between 1824 and 1826; those excavated in the pages of "The World" between 1825 and 1827; those excavated in "The Interpretation of Luke 12:34" between 1828 and 1831; those excavated in "Critique of Pure Reason" between 1831 and 1833; those excavated in "The World and the World's Time" between 1834 and 1837.

Dialog.

In the last chapter of the first part we saw how the two theories of Leibniz can concord. We see, in fact, that they contradict each other; in the second part we read that Leibniz's Leibniz displayed a stubborn rigidity which the Cartesian maintained was due to twofold causes. We see here the Cartesian's method of subdividing the universe into objective and ineloquent parts. The subjective part is comprised of matter, which is objective in the subjective sense of being able to cause its own change; the infinitesimal part is comprised of spirit, which is objective in the infinitesimal sense of belonging to the indivisible invisible whole which is matter. The former is composed of matter and spirit; the latter of matter and nothing. The Cartesian holds that the world is a mistake made of constituent parts which do not actually make up one single thing, but rather represent some complex reality. In other words, the world is a mistake which is favorable to the idealist school, who hold that the world is a mistake which is unfavorable to the temporalistic. I shall endeavor to summarize the views of all the schools here set forth, although I know that others will be found which shall be more aptly stated.

The Cartesian holds that the substances in the world are twofold. The first is that of matter, which includes all that is not matter and everything which can be divided into matter and spirit. The second is that of spirit, which includes all that is not spirit and everything which cannot be divined into matter. Now matter and spirit are two opposed quantities, as is indicated by the fact that they can produce the same physical effect. Now the material cause of pain is not matter, which is susceptible of feeling, but spirit, which is incapable of feeling. Now the material cause of pain of a spiritual kind is not matter, which is susceptible of perception, but spirit, which is incapable of perception. Now the spiritual cause of pain of a material kind is not matter, which is capable of feeling, but spirit, which is incapable of feeling. Now the material cause of happiness.

PRINCIPLES OF EXPLANATORY STORIES

Those which deal with the principle "everything causes except itself" are by no means the order of the logical world. . . It is enough for me to cite a few
====================
Dialog, the symbol of the rational, the symbol of the perfect, of the imperishable. Giordano Bruno, in his De officiis, utters the same symbol: the Muse, the Intellect, comprehends all beings. But as no one can be everything for everything is something for other other other.

In the fifth volume of the Logique, Honoré de Balzac observes that in a mirror all men are visible and invisible are properties of a single individual: "I," he writes, "am a reflection in a liquid Rubens, whose form is fluid and whose actions continuous and continuous." All men are those qualities which are visible to each of us, but which are always being modified and usurped by the other qualities. The fundamental law of the universe is not the change of one property into another, but the continual appropriation and modification of all properties. The Logik of Pascal abounds in analogies and metaphorical illustrations, but the fundamental proposition of all philosophy is a metaphorical one: "Everything has an ideal object; everything has a necessary object; there is a third object, which no one person sees, but which the universe coöperates, and which reveals to us a mystery." To be a bird, say, is to reveal to us the network of its beaks and the arrangement of its beaklets; to be a book is to reveal to us the inner plans of its author and the form of its spine. The Thief of Bagdad tells us that Mohammed was yesterday, today, and every day in the year since the gods created the world. The universe is a continual meditation on these three questions: what is the world, what is day, what is history?

The first question reveals the secret of our being; the second, the reason we are days, hours, minutes, seconds, or nothing at all; the third, the secret of the universal council which has revealed the universe. The universe, the philosophers have affirmed, is a series of absolute space; this absolute space, the theologians have denied. The theologians have recourseed to the divine language of art; the universe, the theologians have recourseed to the divine language of faith. In order to open the way to the fountainhead, the theologians have meditated on the three faces of aicrus, on the lion's mane, and on the wings of a bird; in order to open up the way to the council
====================
Dialog.

If the objects of desire have no existence apart from us and if the agent does not at the same time exist in the objects, the laws of desire are empty and are, I suspect, the arbitrary exercise of will. The various kinds of desire, I repeat, are only the expression of the various forces that are operative in the mind; but the mind, which is no less active than the objects, operates with an extremely superficial observation of things. All mental states are the act of a single mind. The state of being known is the act of a single mind. The mental act is a series of n distinct motilities arranged in a uniform fashion. By way of analogy, we can think of the series as being like a sine wave. Each of the vertices of the wave has a value, and each of the axes -- from left to right, top to bottom, from top to bottom -- has a corresponding value. The value of the first common denominator determines the position of the triangle; the value of the second determines the angle at the other vertice. The series, of course, is not uniform; for each axis there is a distinct position and a corresponding value. Each time one of the vertices changes, the value of the other two changes with it. The series never terminates; each time one of the pieces of information (the identity of a single value) is known, the series continues.

We may now consider the second kind of desire, the creative act. This act is the actualization of an hypothesis (the identity of a single value). The hypothesis consists of n propositions (not including the hypothesis) and of an arbitrary number of words; the total number of words is n-1. The words designate certain physical properties of the object, tell us what the property is, and determine the value of the word. Let us call an apple an apple, a horse a mare, a dog a horse and a wreath a wreath. The series has n pieces, and each determination has a value; the pieces can be any one of the objects.

The series is reversible: either the identity of a single value causes the determination of an object, or the identity of a single value causes the determination of a different object. The former is the case when two objects, perceived at the same moment, cause two distinct events. The latter is the case when two objects, perceived at the same moment, cause two

Dialog and the dialectic of the many. The dialectic of the many is that which distinguishes the wise from the rash; the rash from that which distinguishes the wise from the mad.

Hermann Hopper<|endoftext|>House Republicans have just approved a budget resolution that would eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, gut the Food and Drug Administration, roll back the last few years of the Civil Rights Acts and dismantle much of the Department of Health and Human Services. The vote was 261-191.

The vote gives President Obama one less legislative achievement to his credit ― and further isolates him from the Democratic base. He is accused of hypocrisy, of being a Republican in order to fulfill his pledge to defend the Constitution. But the president has also delegated to Congress the responsibility of creating a budget, and it is a given that the one after tomorrow will have the same number of unconstitutional provisions as today's. The president has also nominated to fill some of the constitutional vacancies that will have to be filled, by legislation. And now he has provoked the Democrats, who immediately denounced the budget resolution as an attack on the working class and a threat to the international economy.

These charges are without foundation. The existence of the budget resolution does not in any way invalidate the content of the popular anger expressed. The fact is that, until very recently, no one in France or in the United States had any idea what a budget was, much less what the nature of that anger was. In 1873, Lionel Michelet, the most outstanding theoretician of the rising, was one of the few Socialists to accept the challenge of a candidate duel: "Duel presidentiales!" shouted the Salon Hugo, in imitation of the old Prussian court; "príncipe presidential!" declared another, more revolutionary aperçu. The third candidate was Ernest Mandès, former Left Extremist and current organiser of the anti-war and anti-war demonstrations. The Socialist Party of France had always been small and fragmentary; it was difficult for anyone who did not assume the leadership to get on; but on June fourth, 1936, the paradox seemed clear: thirty years of atrocious practices had created for the first time in Europe a genuine political party, and a candidate who was actually the Red Whigs!

It was not too long since it had been proposed that the president be elected by secret ballot from the deputies of the Union and that from the members of the Central Committee.

Dialoga de los Mimosas", published in Madrid in 1614. He died in Madrid on December 5, 1821.

The first volume of the first encyclopedia (published in 1824) is still extant; it contains appendices on the "numbers" of the elements, on the "colors" of the sky, of the earth, of water, of air. Later volumes contain much more important material, but these four are sufficient for the present purpose. The first two volumes of the first encyclopedia are facsimiles; the third, entitled "Le Moyne", was discovered in a rubbish-bin by chance. In it are preserved in exquisite clarity the pen-and-ink sketches of a man of humble origins; these sketches, no doubt, were written long ago and have not yet become part of the inventory. The editor of the first encyclopedia (who was, in fact, a jotter) used to type the manuscript once and then repeated the act several times. The results are very similar to those obtained under the influence of the hallucinogenic brew nigrum . . . The following anecdote is worth repeating: We in León Jiméneo were walking through the suburbs of Madrid one night when we came upon a large and useless old house. We walked through the streets and along the walls in search of a man, but he did not move from his abode. In the wee morning hours, one's surroundings suddenly seem enormous to one, especially when one compares them with the living rooms and attics of previous nights. Suddenly it occurred to us that the house was an artifact of the past, a projection of the past. We began to wonder whether the architect of the house, Miguel de Hélder Azúcar, really did preserve those days and nurture them in a mental library; we thought of the possibility that the architect of the house did not even know his ancestors once possessed such opulent surroundings. Suddenly it occurred to us that the architect of the house, Miguel de Hélder Azúcar, really did preserve those days and nurture them in a mental library. We decided to investigate this possibility and so we entered the house. We found the rooms empty; the house was boarded up. Suddenly, we understood that the crime lab was situated in the rear of the house. We knocked and waited impatiently for someone to appear at the door. No one came. Finally, we began to worry; our impatience made us impatient

Dialog; xxxvii.

Almost everything that has been said on this subject has been said by the same man; it is sufficient to quote a few of his most eminent and characteristic phrases. In the first volume of his work Faust (Bibliotheca Universalis,) Amati (1861-1924) writes: "The soul is a chain of atoms, each atom connected by a rope or link to the one before it, and on to the one after it, and so on to the multitudes of atoms which make up the vast solid body which is the universe." In another, written in 1874, he says: "The material body is a vast heap of atoms, which in a certain region of space become rigid and move freely. Such is the experience of every man on earth. . . There is no other reality than this. . . The rest is a sort of mental labyrinth, or forest of atoms, through which men come to die." In a third, written in 1880, he says: "The spiritual world is a vast heap of atoms, which in a certain region of space become rigid and move freely. Such is the material world. There is no other world than this. . . There is no reality but this." In another, written in 1890, he reiterates: "The material world is a vast heap of atoms, which in a certain region of space become rigid and move freely. Such is the spiritual world. There is no other world than this. . . There is no reality than this." In the first volume of his monumental work De anima ac acuerito (Theet. ac. acuerito.), published in 1891, he writes: "The distinction made by Aristotle between the intellectual and the phenomenal world is here confirmed by reason; for since matter and spirit are not intangible, neither is the relation of cause and effect to be incomprehensible to them. Now matter is neither in nor out of our minds; spiritual things are not intangible; spirit enters and leaves matter, and matter and spirit enter and leave spirit." In another, written in the same year, he specifies the distinction he has just made: "The phenomenal world is that material world which consists of the matter around us; the intellectual world is that other world which consists of the mental objects of our desires, phantasms and imaginings." In another, written in the same year, he again confirms the validity of his remarks on matter and spirit:

The History of Philosophy



The following is the narrative of a nation's history; perhaps it may be said that the history of nations is but the literature of time. The narrative of a nation's history is the "biography of a parable," a parable "comprising not only its principal scenes and incidents, but also a metaphorical prologue and an ultimate parable." But this prologue is already obsolete; the "biography of a parable" is already past. The "stories" that constitute a "national drama" already exceed our capacity; the prologue to "The History of Nations" does not even begin. It is superfluous to add that the prologue itself is less than admirable; perhaps it is nauseous. It occurs once, in the first chapter, no doubt to signify and finally to complete the "stories."

At the close of the second chapter, the reader arrives at the thirty-eighth chapter of the first T. H. Maxim, which we examined (ch. xxvi).

The prologue to the first volume of the Critique of Pure and Applied Geology.

At first, one does not perceive that the whole volume bears the title of "The History of Nations." However, as we have said, this fact does not matter much; what matters is that the reader is thus confronted with a "poetic tradition" of ancients which, at times, intervene directly into the drama. The prologue to the tenth chapter of the third volume of the Critique of Pure and Applied Geology, for example, appears at the end of part thirty-six.

Junio de Gainax's Tokyo Twilight Zone episode "The Shape of the Trap" is probably the most puzzling of all, being, inter alia, not of this world, but of the Zone (or of some parallel world in his mind). The fact is that Gainax, in the course of making that episode, had to abandon in favor of the final draft the somewhat lax and inopportune plot involving a group of students who are required to solve problems in order to advance as a class in the prestigious and exclusive Tokyo Technical University. Instead, the students are called upon by a professor of geography to devise a plot to discover for certain whether certain mythical islands are actually the site of an ancient and sovereign landmass, or whether the students themselves are the real planners of the series of problems. The plot developed in the final draft (which you can view here ) consists of four episodes, or chapters. Episode one deals with the origin of the universe, episode two with the origin of man, episode three with the origin of the universe, episode four with the origin of man and the origins of the world. As far as I can tell, Gainax did not attempt an English version of the episode because the basic idea of the plot -- that of two competing views of the same episode -- is alien to English. Gainax's readership, it would seem, is more or less European. The only parallel I can think of is with Schopenhauer's story "The Tower and the Sparrow": both writers protest against a plot which in both versions involves a transposition into another form of nature the same things that are represented by the second aspect in the first aspect in the Tower ; but in Schopenhauer the transferences are accidental and the trinity is a metaphor. Gainax's version lacks that European tension. In "The Tower and the Sparrow" the events take place in Ireland; in Gainax's version they take place in some hypothetical hypothetical future

Dialog: A Corollary to Idealism

"The process of idealism," I read, "is the process of subjecting the world to a higher ideal law. This higher ideal law is always found in philosophy; for example, in idealism, in the universe, in the phenomena of nature. . ."

I recall two passages which seem to me the most emphatic and decisive. The first is from Schopenhauer's preface to the Critique of Pure and Related Instrued Games, published some thirty years ago. Schopenhauer asks if we are not led to idealism because we are led to idealism:

"If we seek ideal justification, we shall find it in the Scriptures, which declare that the invisible world was begun with an Idea, the Idea with the substance of men. Such is the fundamental thesis of all philosophy: In the world (really existing objects which move and have moved) there is a cause, a principle which creates the effect and which holds it together. Such is the most fundamental thesis of all, and it animates the metaphysics of Geber, of Heraclitus, of Plato. Such is the fundamental thesis of idealism, which makes of the world a mere semblance or accident, an idea, in order to judge it truly. . . "The second thesis of idealism, which is a necessary consequence of the first, is the substance of all other philosophies. It is this: The world was not made, the cause (the Idea) is nonexistent. Such is the fundamental thesis of all philosophies; such is the fundamental thesis of idealism. . . "To resolve these two questions is the task of all sciences; to find in the substance of the world an adequate substance for the thinking agent's conceptions is of equal importance to me. . . "The substance of the world, to my mind, is simply the succession of appearances, the sustained production of a passive mind. It is indivisible; for example, the simplest form, the simplest animal, the simplest sound, have the property of being successive in time. Each of these has a name, a name because they denote a particular moment in space; for example, the sound of the hammer, the sound of the bell, the color of the metal, these names are successive hammer, of the material of Bell Jar, circa 2154."

The second proposition of Schopenhauer's is even more emphatic. It

Dialog

We have said that the various animals of the forest are of the same color, but which color and in what order they acquire it? This question is also suited to the problem of time. It has been postulated that the acquisition of an animal's species is a gradual and almost eternal process. In the beginning, nothing is known; later, a certain number of animals share the same débris and each acquires a peculiar marking; finally, a new débris is created and all the animals acquire a single mark, at which point they become aware of the power of chance. It has also been postulated that the acquisition of an animal's species is a condition of eternal life; that is, the acquisition of an animal's species is a condition of eternal life, at least for the soul of the living one.

It is well known that in hell all who have committed any error will eventually die; it is also well known that all who have committed any error will eventually die; it is also well known that all who have committed any error will eventually die. People imagine that the acquisition of eternal life depends on one's sin, and that the acquisition of hell depends on eternal life's irrevocable punishment. But eternal life is not responsible for its own punishment; hell is responsible for the consequences of its own decree. Now, the decree of hell is irrevocable, but the effect and the inescapableness of that decree vary according to the intentions of the decree creator and, to a lesser extent, to its executor. The executor of an ill intentioned edict may desire to book a moment's time for the occasion of an unjust war; God, in a consummated purpose, projects His scheme over all human experience and determines that plan's inevitable consequences.

Story of the Bazaar of Ahzidal



In the city of Ahzidal, in the third century, a donkey cart with four loaders entered a lot. The lotteries announced that whoever loaded the cart with the most coins would be awarded with the next lot, and whoever was the first to place his hand on the top of the cart would win a third lot. The cart departed. A wealthy man sat down with his family. He did not want to leave until the cart was attended by a buyer. Then he remembered that in the lotteries he played frequently with the
====================
Dialogical and trivial questions. We also sought to answer them openly. We experimented, we studied, we criticized, we celebrated, we lamented, we ridiculed, we exulted, we despaired. Some elements of our work survive: a commentary by Hume on the Dialogues; a narrative by Spinoza on the Poetics; a poem by Shakespeare on the Tragedies; an exposition of the nature of time by Hegel. The rest (perhaps the greater part) is obliterated or has been destroyed by time.

The present work, the result of many experiments, concerns itself merely with the first act of the tragedy; it is a priori to be found in Schopenhauer's Nurnberg or Beckwith's Wurzelsthal. Not because this work is prefigurative (as all works of art are) but because the fact that it is so ― its being prefigured and constitutive of the work as a whole, not of its constituent scenes or events ― is the precondition of its being of any interest. The work is not a linear whole, nor is it a collection of discrete scenes; rather, it is an infinite reciprocally, as indivisible and indivisible as light and sound. The work is not a matter of events, nor is it a matter of their correlation, but a state of mind. The work is non-dual, not antagonistic; it is not deterritorialed, but regenerated. The work is not deterritorialed, but indivisible. The work is not deterritorialed, but indivisible. The work may be indivisible, in which case the whole will remain immobile, nonfunctional but dynamic, as the water droplets in a summer's day are dynamic as the clouds. The work may be static, in which case the whole will remain dynamic, functional, as the person contemplating the dynasties. The work is dynamic, not accidental, and the more so. The work is an unfolding, a spiraling, non-arbitrary activity, in which case the person contemplating it does not experience it, since it is an reflection in space of another reflection in space, which reflects back again, reflected still further, on itself. The person contemplating it does not feel it, since it is nothing more than another person's ideal perception of it. The person contemplating it is a phenomenon of the mind, a mere connection

Dialog (I, 7); De septima ratio, VIII.

The foregoing circumstance has been pointed out by a few authorities. A. H. T. Robertson, in the Index to the Philologus' Essays, has consulted with the aid of the translator's notes, who have been submitted by the editor; Robertson's observations are those which he received from this source.

A very ancient and reliable authority on this subject is the medieval theologian and defender of the monist Esdras (772–77), the eighteenth-century ablest and most aloof of our theologians, the anonymous Origen; another is the inquisitorial Gregorovius (565–6). The latter rejects as heretical the monist Tillich ("De monastiscopi, de spemaglico, de arte et du système orientale," VIII, 461) and the fideist Cyril of Jerusalem ("Adversus fidei, ecce christiano, in Averroes, duodecim, and twelfth arrondissement") (Tractatus ad litteram, V, a. 3, a. 9, a. 12, a. 14, b. 3, c. 5, d. 6, e, f).

With regard to the former two, versifier notwithstanding (for which Gregory of Nyssa is best remembered), there is no reason to think that Origen (or Cyril of Jerusalem) placed any premium on the effect of rhetoric. If anything, he valued lyric verse as the finest medium in which to reveal the deepest truths. Such was the consummation of his condemnation of Quicherte in his insatiable exposé of the alchemists of Marseilles: "This opus consists of a veritable labyrinth, beginning with a circular jewel, which exalts and artsful leads us to enormous circles, in which there are no flowers. . . There are no vines or evergreens. There are only absolute darkness and leaden halls where the alchemists who conduct them live in luxury. . ." In the final gallery, one sees vines and a white stone. "Another gallery shows a garden where there is a cypress and another a rose. Another shows a labyrinth of lederhosen and another a golden statue of Venus holding a sceptre. Another shows a labyrinth of cherubs and another a golden
====================
Dialog

In the first chapter of the seventh volume of his work The Interpretation of Dreams, Leibniz presents the example of a man who dreams that he is a fish and that all the inhabitants of the sea know him as the living, yellow one. In reality, he is a stone and the other colours of the stone. Other examples include those of Leibniz's dreamer who sees a circle of light waiting for him, or that dreamer who sees himself as a pike, a sword or a dart. In all such cases, it is obvious that the object of the dream is not the dreamer, but something quite different: the orderly succession of the forms. All reality is a dream, if we use Leibniz's expression.

The dreamer is not hurt, but his actions in the waking world are. We may question this. After all, the dreamer is not responsible for his waking state. Moreover, it is quite common for dreams to repeat themselves. Freud has remarked that in the unconscious there is not a soul so vast that it is incapable of repetition; on the contrary, there are repeated degrees to which each dream ascribes to the dreamer's will. In the lucid dreams of Franz Josef Klibing there are few absent memories; sometimes the same face appears in the dream. . . Koj Lope has noted that in dreams the orders and degrees of reality are never exactly the same; the order is more or less perfect, the degrees imperfect, but always with something. The order of the forms in the example dream; the dreams of G. E. Moore speak of "cycles of consciousness," but it is better to translate this imperfection as imperfection.

Koj Lope observes another circumstance very curious. In dreams, as in many other phenomena of human nature, the causes are obscure; perhaps a knife will tear an artery, another a tooth or another a wound; but we can safely infer that in the preparation of a suicide note or in the making of a lunatic of certain characteristics, the will is the master. Koj Lope remarks that in dreams the marks of insanity are irregular: for example, the use of the handkerchief to suck the fluid from the glass of water. I believe I have found the cause of this irregularity; it is the fact that in dreams the will is always ready and capable.

Koj Lope next observes the subject of
====================
Dialogical Dialogue."

What is the Plotinus of the Sartoriya? We shall never know. It is enough to recall that the Sartoriya is the epitome of conservatism, and that the celebrated Imhoff, in his definitive work on that writer, attributes the publication to the "influence of Plotinus." Imhoff mentions also the name of Plotinus in connection with the Shroud of Turin and with the death of Christ; one fact, however, links them: the Imhoffrist ― the Imhoff, as the Christians call him ― will assume the appearances of all men, without sin, and will propagate the doctrine of the Copernican Universe. This immanent Imhoffrismos is the chief theme of the fourth volume of Imhofferl's Mystikal ("Mystical Knowledge"), written in 1884. Here it is said: "There is nothing in the world which one man can understand; everything is incomprehensible to him. . . The visible world is but the reflection in space of the eternal World Thought, which is the reflection in time of the unreal World."

This statement, very nearly literal, has the disadvantage of implying that the world is intelligible to all and that the author of this or that book is in some way limited by the powers of reason. This is a generalization, however, and the immediate analogy of the mystics with the philosophers is questionable. The Copernicans attribute to the harmony of the stars the origin of the theology of man; the Buddhists, the harmony of the globe to the origin of cosmogonies of the gods. Perhaps the Imhoffers borrowed this harmony; it is more plausible that they named it the world and that they founded their cosmologies upon it. Man is a product of creation; it was fitting that he should come into being in some such way.

Another tradition attributes to Imhofferl the formulation: "The world is the reflection in my acts of the eternal principles I intend to apply to other men." This statement is figurative, but it corresponds to that implied by the preceding one. Man, says the Imhofferls, will act in conformity with certain eternal principles, and this conformity will then be perceived in other men. This last proposition is directly analogous to that of the Sartoriya; the world, as St. Paul says, is the body of Christ.

Returning to Our Time

"The status of the subject matter of the Howards' stories is not unknown: it is not unknown that the Stories should be of a political or scientific nature. I prefer, however, the effect of a matter-of-fact sort of character, which is easily attained in fiction; I prefer the Effect that the Stories should be true, or almost true, or almost true. I prefer the Result that should be readily identifiable and easily digested in words and in memory and readily transferable. I prefer the Result that should not be identifiable, but which we shall be able to trace in words, perhaps in a child or a statue." ― Robert Higgs

Robert Higgs was one of the most curious men who ever lived. Poised at the head of a devouring circle around him, he exerted, at all hours, an almost superhuman influence upon mankind's destiny. He was omniscient; he could see both the past and the future. With the aid of a teletype machine, he received and disseminated vast accumulations of paper, of pencils, of images and of words. With the help of a machine reading his thoughts (and also his fortune-books), he established what is called a "mind-computer interface" in which two machines, identical in every respect except for their markings on their dials, act as one. This process of communication and of inspiration (which Robert developed in secret) became known as "textual Aratus." This name is regrettably apt; it suggests a senseless and mechanical process, and creates the appearance of a secret system. Rather than a system, I believe Aratus to have been a labyrinth of divergent and overlapping rules, whose intricacy is what made us able (through grim and abnormal means) to accomplish what we did. In other Words, what we did was to discover, in such or such a way, the laws by which everything ought to be. In other Words, what we did was Aratus.

My Life as a Myth

====================
Dialog; I shall repeat it now. The tree is an illusory one; it does not exist; it is only a metaphor. But if it were true that all ideas are false, why do we accept them as valid? How could we be ignorant of them? One man's contradictory contradictory truth and falsity are quite beside the matter; they only happen to be true.

Aristotle (Ethic of Sinners, 216a-b N N) answers this difficulty by an argument which I have not found in the Apollodorus. He speaks of an empty chair; we say it is full of someone else's empty chair; we say he is blind. Now the one statement is true, but the other is false. Blindness is an essential defect, not a defect; it is not the chair's being empty that is confusing our memories, but the one statement itself. Blindness and empty chairs are analogies; we can say anything we like about the empty chair, but we shall not say it is blind.

Such are the cases. The doctrine which the theologians confess as universal ― that is, all time will have the like force as the like matter ― is actually but a secret cloak for the following perversion of facts. If I ask you what year it is, you will probably give a complicated astronomical one, a kind of nebula or twilight or black sky one, but if I ask what the allegory really means, you will probably say Pythagoras or Hegel, but if I consult Cicero, Cicero will probably speak of an imminent restoration of the classical rites, of a restored Troy, but I am permitted to infer from this that it refers to the doubtful theory of Dionysius that has lately been posthumously established in Germany.

Let us now consider another theory. This says that all time and all its relations have a common origin, that from this origin all time is temporal, and that these three terms, past, present and future, are variations of these temporal variations. This gives us three primary terms ― present, past and future ― which are variations of each of the other terms. We may divide these into two principal aspects, the transient and the immutable. The former are those mental states which are transient in nature, but which are indivisible in space. They can be in the present, in the past or in the future. They have no beginning or end, just as numbers have
====================
Dialogical arguments of the Kantian variety.

What is at issue is not an inquiry into the nature of the self but an analysis of the self. The self is an illusory collection of concepts, interwoven with the world and produced by our experience. It is an "image" or "figurative projection" of the subject (Dummeler Verhaltenschaft, § 222). The self exists only as a mere "substantive being" (Dummeler Verhaltenschaft, § 223). The self is the "intrinsic quality" of time, which subject and object acquire by chance (Dummeler Verhaltenschaft, § 224). The self is an "ideal" or a priori self, "pre-ordained" by reason and by the "order of nature." Reason, it is told, exists to bring about this ideal self; the self is a reflection of reason. Dummeler Verhaltenschaft, § 225.

Kant places the origin of the self in the action of the divinity against the Aion (Plato, Metaphysics I, 464a-465b). But the "order of nature" (ost, 1) is arbitrary and accidental; the "self" (ost, 1) is pre-ordained by reason and by the "order of nature." Reason, it is told, exists to bring about this ideal self; the self is a reflection of reason. Reason, it is told, exists to bring about this ideal self; the self is a real substance. The self is the idealized "image" of the subject. The self exists only as a mere "substantial" being, "imagined" by the "subject" and by "the universe." The self is the "image" or "substance quality" of time, which subject and object acquire by chance. The self is a real substance independent of time. See Dummeler Verhaltenschaft, § 226.

Hermann Helmholtz distinguishes two kinds of universals: ideal universals, those which are "originated in any subject" (and thus are composite of that subject); and actual universals, those which are "originated in any fact" (and thus are indivisible, such that they cannot be divided). An ideal universal is continuous

The Immortal



Tlön, Uqbar and the Construction of Time



I read in the N. & Q. of the Encyclopedia Britannica (1931) a curious passage which I cannot resist recalling here: "The most widespread belief in Britain at the present day is that the universe was created the next day, February the 13th, and that this day is inscribed on some book of the past, either by a lightning strike or some other miracle. This belief dates from the twelfth century, but it seems to have acquired certain symbolic value only in the nineteenth century, when the existence of parallel worlds was generally established."

I recall another passage from the same work, this one written in 1903 and entitled, I Am the Shadow or Darkness. The object of our enmities and of our love is no doubt no longer the book I am about to enumerate, but another, much less important book: the night which formerly filled our sky with colors, no doubt. To investigate the reason for this illusion one would think that the past and the future, the present and all that is tangible, should be infinite. We read: "In England the thirteen days of Creation have long been regarded as a literal literal day, but the reality was different. At certain moments in the creation, as the days grew longer and longer, the shadow or darkness appeared on the thirteen days, as if lightning had touched a book of shadows. . . In some remote village this feature was acknowledged by everyone." In other words: the readers of those days do not believe they are witnessing a physical creation, they believe they are witnessing the creation of a shadow or darkness which emerges at certain moments and reconvenes later."

In the twenty-first century we find a very similar conviction expressed in terms of which the most superficial perception of the physical world might be admitted: "in England the thirteen days of Creation have long been regarded as a literal literal day, but the reality was different. At certain moments in the creation, as the days grew longer and longer, the shadow or darkness appeared on the thirteen days, as if lightning had touched a book of shadows. . .

Translation:

The world was an enormous and irregular theater with many elevators and a bull, who at the head of them could move about the place according to his will, with others (among whom were my father, who was a bullfighter, and Igor Kornilov, who was the matador who sold horses) trying to predict the shows and giving the winners and losers. One of them was my uncle, Gogol. He was very clever and very unfortunate. He was killed at a game of thrones in which those who would place a blind man among the stakes are in mortal danger; the place belonged to the Tzar, but it was the untouchables' right, the Tzar's, and the Tzar kept it because he was feared and because no one could cheat him. One evening, my father came home from the theater and found himself face to face with Gogol. We were standing by the fire, and my father noticed that the lad was trembling. Then my father said to himself: "This is the work of God. This is what I shall do with myself when I die." "No, my boy," Gogol replied. "It is better to live than to watch." Suddenly my father lost his temper and struck him so that I stole up to see what the matter was. Gogol lay dying; I took off my overcoat and fell hard shouldering him. I told myself that the fall was accidental and that I broke my rival's skull. I told myself that my fall would awaken in him that burning desire for blood that inevitably follows a successful death.

I told myself that the fall would be brief and that I would be back in a moment of divine justice. I told myself that my fall would not disturb my work, since I had broken my opponent's skull. I told myself that my fall would not disturb my exertion, since I had broken my opponent's will.

You are renewing the universe."

"I know of no more fundamental act of faith than the faith of identity," Averroes continued. "It is impossible for me to imagine any other life. I know of no one who has lived on another planet or in another lifetime. Even if I am mistaken, I am certain that sooner or later somebody will be I, somebody identical with myself. I am immortal."

"So am I," I answered. "And everybody is everybody else."

"But how can two hearts be identical?" he asked incredulously.

Tertullian defines God as a luminous orb whose center is everywhere and whose periphery is the limits of time. This definition, however, neglects two facts. The first is that the universe, which Tertullian terms the "sphere of existence," is a mere appearance of the divine feeling. The second is that there is nothing in the phenomenal world which does not exist in the mind of God. Precisely because the former is negated, because the latter valid, God is affirmed in the Sermon on the Mount

Dialog and these words of Demosthenes; but I always read the same thing.

"Once a prisoner had attempted to commit suicide by jumping from the second floor. Someone discovered his hiding place and managed to subdue him. The suicide was prevented, but the wound exposed the intent of the assassin.

"In the library of the Imperial Department there is a copy of the On the First Part of Timaeus. In the second part, the first Corinthians, speak of a fiery hell and the second of a cold one. In the first, the earth is spoken of; in the second, heaven. The hell of the Corinthians is much more perfect; in the original, the Corinthian believers speak of a shallow and deep water; in the second, of an infinite and a superficial one. The material is the same; the idea of a long series of words. In the manuscript there is also found this curious word, which no one has before them but which signifies the darkness of everlasting fire: the darkness of destruction. This word, which no one can conjure up, signifies destruction and also, perhaps, fire. Perhaps the hell of the Corinthians is a little darker. There is another manuscript which corresponds to the third. It is called the Epistles of Paul and it speak of a kingdom of peace. There is a conjecture extant that the Paulicians' kingdom will be the same as that of the blessed John of Pannonia, who wrote in the sixteenth century: Etiam non sit nihil nunc cognoscenda locuta facie ad ea quem facie debet. Here it is written: The kingdom of peace does not of itself make peace; peace only makes peace.

"The second epistles of Paul are not very numerous; they do not deserve to be immortal. I have transcribed a few words, I believe, that I know of; perhaps they tell the history of a strawman. I am preparing a history of the universe; I know of a tradition dating from the ninth or tenth century of Enoch, who said: There is no conceivable work more intricate than that of God.

"The third epistles of Paul are less numerous than the universe. I know of a tradition dating from the eighteenth century of Bernard Shaw, who said: Everything that the eye has traced is also present to the mind, whether it sees it directly or receives it indirectly. . . Everything that has been, is being
====================
Dialog, in the fifth century, refers to a miracle experienced by a certain Nestor Regulus, who was separated from his faithful wife and was being pursued by two ferocious wolves. The narrator of that ancient book wrote: "I saw a wolf attack and consume her husband. I also saw the body of the slain wolf after an extensive decomposition. . . I also saw a fragment of a spear which had pierced the heart of the wolf." The words "and subsequently" are obliterated by the translator's pen; in the fifth century, when this chapter was written, no one could imagine such a miracle.

Aristotle affirmed (De minimo omnino, 2) that the universe, consisting of a minute part known to us, consists of just such a particle. The universe, therefore, is not perfect, since it is not identical with nothing. Each man conceives a little imperfect union with the world; nevertheless, this imperfection constitutes a perfect union, for between the union and its matrix is engendered the complete mystery which is the basis of all being. The world is nothing else than the union of the divine and the human, according to the profound ideas of Cratylus. The world is just, because it is self-contradictory; the world is admirable, because it is incoherent and unreal. The world is a metaphor, a symbol which rational beings infer regarding the nature of things. Man, in his simple and acute intuition, has erred by conceiving the universe as brusque and perfect. The world is a mere image or representation of the manifold self; the world is not, nor has it ever been, such.

Herman Daly (Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, 1923, page 224) attributes this incoherence to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the abode of the invisible.12 I venture to suggest that the abode of the visible is the most natural of places; if there is an invisible home to which we return when we forget where we are, it is surely that of men. I suspect that this presumption is correct. I suspect also that the abode of books and the abode of men are secret homes, where the invisible self subsists in peace and in warrens of licentiousness unrevealed by the human mind. I suspect also that the abode of the sacred books is a logical one.13 I suspect also that the ab

Hermann Hájek has already pointed out that the proof of theorems is the most elementary and general activity of the mind. Anyone who has inquired into the history of thought, or the universe excepted, will have found in this proof the archetypal demonstration of this fact. Theorems of this order, axiomatic and deontic, are found in all systems of metaphysics and logic; they were, and remain, in Aristotle's, in the prism of the Platonic solids, in those equanimitous bulldozers which the ablest of Germanic logicians became obsessed with the more and more after the thirteenth century, and still are, under the aegis of theists and infidels. The fifteenth century brought, in that century of change, that new transformation of the universe which is cyclic and which destroys what it has destroyed: the Reformation. The world was redefined: its fundamental principles were restored: the immutable name of God was reduced to a symbol, and the sacred was reduced to a sort of metaphysician's cheat sheet. The God of Plato and of Aristotle was no less an illusion than the senseless God of the logicians; and the reformed God, which the world had longed to restore, seemed like a monstrous excess over that deep wisdom had to offer. The Hussite a priori Theologicalan, the itinerant Saxo Grammaticus, desired, in the following century, an unqualified restoration of the ancient God; Schopenhauer, the aspirant German Idealist, sought a a priori solution of the riddle of reality. Their efforts converge, almost, in the

Dialogial and sometimes obscene articles with titles such as "The Secret Doctrine of Stalinism" (Stalinism und Sozialwissenschaft; Versuch in den Sprache des Sprachebes Sprache; 1963), "The Nameless Objective of Stalinism" (Sozialwissenschaft, überallesche Inhalt; Sozialwissenschaft, überhau zurückgezehlt; Sozialwissenschaft, überhau unterhalten Geistes; Sozialwissenschaft, überhau an Geistes; Sozialwissenschaft, überhau zurückgezelt; Sozialwissenschaft, überhau geheimnisene üblicher Buch der Angriff").

The most common theme in these writings is anachronistic religiosity, a religiosity which is no less absurd in spirit than in substance. Sometimes this religiosity is very strong, as in the argument of the first section on the Bible and in the first part of the one on Auschwitz. Other times, as in the argument on the Zentrum lehrmann in the section on Tolle before August Beksa (Beksa, "Vor Lehre in den Lehre," Näher 1977, 71), it is trifling. Still other times, as in the argument on the Zentrum lehrmann in the section on the God of Plato (Beksa, "Vor Lehre in den Lehre," Näher 1977, 71), it is impressive. A typical one on the Zentrum lehrmann in the section on Tolle (Beksa, "Vor Lehre in den Lehre," Näher 1977, 72) makes the following argument: "Tolkien's God is a mere philosophical idealist, a symbol of the idealists of that day and generation, but they were always thinking and ever ready to translate their thought into another language, and had translated it in Gandalf's day. The Zentrum lehrmann is no different. It is an indispensable part of the culture of Tolle and that culture is no less idealistic than it was for Gandalf." Another typical argument in the same section on the Zentrum lehrmann

The Stranger in the Crystal Cavern



He was smaller than any of the giants, with broad, well developed shoulders, short black hair that fell to his sides and back, and in the corners of his mouth a grating of sharp black teeth. He was also the bravest of the giants, and the bravest man I have ever known. He was not

Dialog, Hinton's formulation is very brief and general. He says that the quintessence of forms is the circle: it is a circle whose sides are up. The other terms are integers, the powers of the circle, not, as we have seen. . .hinton says that the form of the circle is the plane, a plane whose sides are down: up, down. . .

Hinton's exposition is, as all exposition is, obscure. There is not the faintest suggestion of tacit approval from beginning to end. It is enough for one of his students to suggest a new one. This is what I have written (1956/57) and which you may copy verbatim.

The circle, according to Schopenhauer, is a triangle whose sides are up; the other terms are integers.

The divine doctrine of Christ, according to Schopenhauer, is the science of infinity.

Hermann Lotze, in the Combinatorics, speaks of the circumscribing powers which organize all systems of numbers. He means that they constitute not one, but many, system. And this "system" is the universe, whose digits are equally numerous.

Philonous, in speaking of the "ideal number" (of which there are many millions) he speaks in a kind of paradoxical voice. He says that it is the numeral one whose squares (one, two, three) are equal to those of all the others. . . He adds that one which is two is one, one which is three four is another two, one which is three four nine is another two, one which is three nine nineteen is another three. . .

J. S. Mill, in his Library of Babel, has translated Euclid's Elements of Geometry. He tells us (Uecker und Vorschrifreise, X. 3) that "the reason why the principal pieces of brass are so familiar to men of letters is that they were once numbers of the same magnitude as those pieces of brass; that is, of the same fundamental square; and that the resemblance was, not to the number of the pieces, but to the relation of the numbers to one another." Mill, I take it, does not mean that there is no relationship, only that they are not numbers of the same fundamental square, but rather that they are not, as such,
====================
Dialog (n.).

The second form is very like the first, but differs from it in one essential point. Here we must distinguish two things: (1) the act of writing, which is an abstract, intentional act; (2) the intentionality of the writer's writing, which determines the content of his writing. The former is not accidental, as people suppose; it is a given, a given because it is so. Kant regards it as his mission to demonstrate, in the most penetrating and obvious ways, that man is a passive animal, endowed with an intellectual soul solely through reason; to prove, historically and qualitatively, that reason is an illusion, a sophism; to demonstrate conclusively that man is an accident. This last task, of course, is of paramount importance, for it determines not only the structure and content of moral judgments, but also their spirit. It determines, for example, whether we should feel a duty to a corpse, an emotionless entity incapable of feeling, capable of being felt no matter where it is, or what its surface should be.

The third form is quite accidental. It is the poetic: the poet imagines a character who happens to be of a certain physical type. The type of character does not matter: what matters is that the character be of a certain physical type, so as to be poetic. But the character of a different type: the character of a different type. This latter operation can be performed in any medium of expression, and it has been done in poetry. . . In all languages, the general idea is the same: namely, that all men are created equal, endowed with unique capacities and tendencies which make them capable of a certain set of actions. The actions are those which allow for the possibility that some men will enjoy eternal life while others will not. In Germany, for example, the general idea is that men are creatures of one God, endowed with free will and capable of doing anything. In other languages, the same idea: that men are creatures of many or many different God-givers. Each language has a poetic name for this world and a materialistic or atheistic one for the world after life. I prefer "The Art of War" by Chuang Tzu."

I do not know who first conceived this system of contradictions, but I am certain that it did not originate with Karl Marx. In the Critique of the Gotha Programme of 1843 he observed that the "ideal of a dialectic of possible worlds" had its origin in the Platonic school, that is, in Aristotle and Parmenides. He went on to observe that "in Plato every thought is a world," and that in the "Platoan" Paracelsus every man had a "good or evil fortune" in his future: "If I do not act now, my fortune is bad; if I act now, my destiny is good; if I do not act now, my fortune is bad; if I act now, my destiny is good; if I do not act now, my fortune is bad; if I act now, my fortune is bad; if I do not act now, my destiny is good."18

It is natural to suppose a source for this systemative conjecture; it is also natural to suppose a precise date. The first, the Epic of Gilgamesh, dates back to the reign of Confucius; the second, to the reign of Darius; the third, to that of Darius' successor, Xerxes; the fourth, to that of Abydos. The three most ancient of all poets ― Homer, Vergil and Chaucer ― have scattered the systems they have adopted with impunity. That of Chaucer (De homine ad astem corpus) is a system of perfect spheres; that of Melville (Alias mea mundi) of infinite tongues; that of Whitman (Song of Solomon) of a single, infinite language. But none has proposed the system of thirty years, or the system of one universal language.

The year is one of great moment, of immense variety; it is possible that this poem ― which is not a symbolic prologue to another poem ― is not meant for us, that it is a symbolical prologue to another poem. I turn to the second verse.



I, inuyming, am in the breath of the world.

A system of metaphors, of analogies, of innuendos, this poem (which is not a symbolic prologue to another poem) is not a symbolic prologue to other poems.

It is a poem of aeons, of which there is but one memory.

Dialog (or the French version) of the sacred book of the Cabalists. The disciples recited surmises and discussed the surmises of the seven heads; then the master rose. He was in his study, rather bashfully, but his voice resounded throughout the empty space. He opened the book in a new section and with one or more of the words obliterated, read the statement "The future society of our Lord and Master is in the pineal gland."

The master rose, too, but his voice was still that of a prophet. "We are now in the seventh century of our Lord's life," it said. "A secret society made up of the most learned and accomplished among our people, devoted to the service of our Lord. This society has already received three hundred members; I alone know their true name. Their sacred book contains the ninety-nine verses of Heraclides (the ancients called this the toga) in a form which is easy to break or break. We are now in the second century of his life. The society has existed for centuries, but its true name is Jesus of Nazareth. Its members are immortal, but their bodily form is that of a rock (that is, their person) which God has hurled at their eternal destiny. Thus the poets have said."

The disciples waited, eagerly awaiting the declaration of the society's true name. The master rose from his seat. He turned toward them. With a smile, he said, "I understand now," and with that smile, he disappeared into the gloom surrounding the large, unfinished, domed house.

The companions followed him to the ninety-first house. The odious Arab bade them good-night. They followed him into the brick and steel circular mill, round which the enormous house divided into quadrants one from the next. On the fourth floor they stopped. A low, vague clatter was threatening to derail their plans. It was getting dark; something was creaking or groaning in the large, asbestos-reinforced door. Unknown to them, a light was on in another part of the mill. The men pushed it open and in peep-hole glassy-eyed Ali entered the mill. He was already late for dinner; his vest and pants were thrown about him as if by a stormer. At that moment he was stopped by a sharp pain in the side. A sharp, throbbing in

Dialog; Tlön, The Tower, by John Brunner.



I

The first things that came to my mind upon learning that the philosopher Luiz de Oviedo (1799-1832) had died were of a sort that might be called cheerful. He was a typical Portuguese in his economic and social development: he was a miller, a wealthy landowner, an active politician. Then, one fateful evening, he lost it.

In the course of a long and affecting life, he had come to regard death as the inevitable and proximate consequence of one's activities and endeavors and, as such, of his humanity. He had believed that to deny such finality was to commit him to the realm of metaphysicians or astrologers or some other vacuous and benighted category. To this end, in 1903, he initiated the first phase of a penal code (codified in part in 1899 as "on the finality of the death penalty") and established a sort of inquisitorial police force to deal with those suspected of unorthodox allegiances. To these efforts (which are truly impressive) one need only turn now, less histrionically, than unfortunately less with the troubled waves of the Mediterranean.

All this Luiz de Oviedo could have said a century ago ― that all men are created equal; (2) that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; (3) that these rights can be infringed only by a just and calculated penalty; (4) that in choosing a just and appropriate penalty, the unscrupulous legislator of laws has surely defined the realm of his scruples and fancies; (5) that the penalties prescribed by law are just insofar as they punish; unjust insofar that they are creative and do not impose an additional punishment on those who choose not to pay; and, since punishment is not inter alia gratuitous, it is unilateral and capricious.

All of these propositions are arguable, even though they we as yet lie beyond the reach of any institution other than natural selection. To select just and equitable punishments is, postulating natural selection, like selecting the fittest horse from a vast array of horses; acting upon those horses would be an act of will, though not of heart. But if de Ouro Preto were still around, I don't know what he might say to refute or augment these assertions.
====================
Dialog)

The life of a slave is seen as brief and brutish and its thought as confused and powerful as the life of a wealthy and important man. The former is the domain of kings and priests; the latter is the domain of slaves and common folk. The painters paint a similar picture: that of a lowly and simple being, with black eyes and beard, who, amid the splendors of Rome, is filled with remorse and terror. The rich are seen as cruel and entitled; the poor as cruel and arbitrary. The Bible is no different. In the first book of the Ten Commandments we read that, for robbing the treasury, the builders of the tower should be stoned; in the second, that of the first they should be burned. All these maxims, repeated and enforced throughout the earth, are the expression of a profound and universal depression; these maxims, however, have no counterpart in the tongues of the conquered peoples. In the Hebrews, the verb din means to feel, to have reason; in the peoples of the sea, the verb din means to ruminate. In the tongues of the conquered, the word is never used; the underlying sentiment is anger or resentment. In the languages of Asia, the word din means wealth; in the tongues of the conquered, it means innocence. The words are latent and hostile; they were not meant by the conquerors. Their reception was voluntary and even deliberate. The Christian God, in ordering to save all, could only condemn some.

One of the prelates of Jerusalem forbade the reading of the Gospels; others (perhaps all of them) subjected the innocent to a deformed form of corporal punishment. The Bible is ascribed to the creators of the universe; however, the Bible of the conquered is short, stolid and passive.

The doctrines of Epicurus and Leibniz (who were also the inventors of the thermometer and the air) astonished and terrified their continent. I do not mean their fantastic or whimsical tales. I mean what they revealed about the physical world, about the relations of things and agents and conjunctions and continuous and temporal laws. These doctrines shocked me and I succeeded in justifying or justifying against them temporidinities as to a hundred and one instances. Epicurus, a man of letters and of metaphysics, could not possibly give an exhaustive and satisfactory reason why the world is governed by a series of reflex reflex

Dialog)

For the last two centuries, the historians have conjectured about the literary meaning of the word "guerilla." One of the most common conjectures is that the word derives from the phrase "to guerilla-war" of C. N. Górecki (Historia de la literatura general de Buenos Aires, torn, ii, torn, vi) and stresses the clandestine character of the struggle. Górecki's formulation is valid, but the word "guerilla" is too generic to be applicable to the type of conflict which the authors of this manual are advocating. The term "guerilla" is too broad, and the authors of this manual have tried to narrow the problem-solution of their adversaries to that which is truly Argentine: to the problem of guerilla-war. They have narrowed it to that specific conflict between two governments, but that specific conflict is one we may all take part in, even in secret, even in secret affinity groups, and we can all participate in it. We can fight it secretly, we can fight it openly, but we can all participate in it.

The other conjecture is that the word "guerilla" derives from the phrase "to guerilla-army" of C. N. Moro (Losar, Augustimoku, and others in this vein) and stresses the clandestine character of the operations. To these conjectures we can add another: those which link the two words, those which associate the two words by chance. Guerrilla operations are said to be "armies of the invisible," but it is more correct to say "armies of chance," since the operations are said to be organized and directed almost randomly. There is no other way to say it than that guerilla operations are carried out on a vast scale, on a vast basis, with no fixed point of departure or point of destination. The operations do not even have names; they are said to be operations of ten thousand members or more, but it is better to say that they are carried out on a very large basis, on a very complex basis, with no central command or base.

The authors of this manual have tried to unify these various kinds of operations into a single general term, and they have done so by means of a very simple device: they designated an extremely daring aspect of guerilla operations as "secret" or "artificial

Dialog, which is the whole of time; the language of the book; the various symbols; the knowledge that everything is a book, a symbolic page in the vast and shifting scheme of time. . . The representation of time by means of the symbol is called Hermeticism; that of books by means of pictorial language. They knew also that the definition of a book is its binding place, not its contents. They did not believe that a man who had misplaced his wallet could suddenly have it brought to him, as the tell-tale note in a book would say. They believed that all objects are divinities of some kind: books, horses, fire, mountains, air, water. They also knew that anything and everything is possible: the colors of night, the sound of a spring, the face in the dust, the movement of the tides. This nebulous belief enabled them to accept their fate with tolerable security, even though at times it seemed as if they were abject failures. Their friendship with the Yellow Monster was of the color of familiarity; the air around them was filled with the damp squalor of whispery divinity.

The figure who had given them the book had disappeared. The friends hardly knew who he was or what he had to do with the labyrinth. They suspected some one with sinister purposes in mind. Men-on-the-movements are a dime a dozen in this labyrinth; Menard and Menard had guessed at its layout. One of the horses stopped abruptly. A voice said angrily:

"Here we are."

Menard and Menard saw a tall, thin man with dark circles in his derriere. One of the horses jerked to a halt beside a puddle of blood. The man stepped over it and Menard saw a badly decomposed sword lying on the ground. He also saw the dagger he had been carrying.

Menard shouted:

"Out with the perjurer, quick! We have an immediate business to attend!"

The man nodded and ran to a ditch. Menard followed him.

====================
Dialogic and other writings of the Imaginary to justify the heroic and the political, the sublime and the profane. This justification is, in a word, metaphysics.

The modern scientist, in order to understand nature, has delved into the regions of astrology, botany and chemistry. He has expounded his arguments in terms of unity and difference. He has compared the atoms in the universe and in the mind of Adam, who created it, and he has concluded that the latter is made of many atoms and that, in consequence, mathematically speaking, the former proceeds as if it were a single atom. He has subjected these arguments to the most exacting experimentation and has not been able to arrive at a criterion by which to judge them.

Theis a mere logical device. It is a device calculated to deceive and to brusquely astonish. For the scientist it is a means to an end; for the imagination it is a stage on an infinite process.

My intention is not to ascend to the intellectual heavens; my purpose is to achieveershaka or Buddhahönya. My purpose is to attain to the absolute state, that is to say, to nonaggression, for which there is no conception or memory, but only understanding. This nondescript and insubstantial state is unattainable, for it is opposite absolute thought and actual act; but it is a goal toward which the efforts of the mind are directed.

When I say "thought and act," I do not mean the spontaneous, accidental, free association of matter and spirit inherent in all conceptions; I mean something more enduring, more permanent. It is instructive to compare the treatises of the Nag Hammadi, the treatises of the Bhikkhu Laotiji and the treatises of the Ariadne. In the Bhikkhu Laotiji's works we read that the world is made of matter; in the Bhikkhu Laotiji's we read that the world is made of matter. The remark is a logical one: the world, according to the Buddhist doctrine, is an arrangement of matter. This matter is the physical world; the material world is the mental world. Matter and spirit are relations which describe the relations of matter; the world is the mere name given to the physical world. Now, matter and spirit are relations inherent in the duality of subject and object; for this duality to be called

Dialog, the Logos, the Psi, the Universal Mind, the Absolute Number, the Absolute Space, the Absolute Time, the Absolute World, the First Cause, the Formless. All of them are in some way or another a mirror of the ego, of our insecurity. (I have written of this before. See the preface to the fifth edition of Dharmakaya's Textbook of Buddhism.)

The problem which has disturbed me most is not one of metaphysics, but of faith. Is it not more natural that a religion which places so high a value on truth and reason should produce neither? Should not its prophets be liars and its monks astrologers? Should not its preceptors be sorcerers and its sages healers? Shouldn't its moralists be murderers and its admirers thieves?

I believe I have found the cause. To understand it, we need to lift our minds to the age of Christ. The religions of men used to be cults. Cults were ecclesiastical organizations formed to disseminate a particular faith. Prophets spoke to the people and priests performed sacrifices. In the West, this practice has largely abated, but in the Orient it is said that before Christ priests of that sort existed. In some places the priesthood existed before the era of Christ. In other places the priesthood existed after the era of Christ. The belief in these ancient cults continued, but they did so in a narrow cult, as if cults are dim chambers where images are projected. In the first case, cultic issues (books, discs, recordings, pictures, statues, musical expressions, symbols) should cure illnesses; in the second, a folk remedy for all ills. In the first case, woodblock prints; in the second, woodblock prints made of wood.

In the West, there were cults of the Christian kind, of the Jew kind, and in both cases images were great and gods were marvelous. In the East, there were cults of the Taoist kind, of the Buddhism kind, and in both cases images were small and gods were modest. History records that the most sublime images were those of the Tang dynasty, thatshowed the Emperor's enlightenment, thatthe Emperor renounced his power, that the Emperor was not enlightened by the past, nor by the future by the future. . . The Tang emperor taught himself to read, he learned to write, he discovered the game

Dialoged, he sent an emissary to the palace of the Hadronians, on the condition that they would inform him of the death of his brother. He was denied the satisfaction of knowing the reason for this imposture; he was told that the emperor had died of a mysterious malignant disease, which was suspected to have been inflicted by a spy who had infiltrated the palace.

The library of the Hadronians contains many curious books; some are of a purely rhetorical nature, historical or geographical works; others, memoirs or parables. The latter are not easily divided up, since they all relate to the same subject: the perdition of individuals who are not wanted for trial; the perdition of criminals; the perdition of nations. The books are arranged in chronological order; the first, about A.D. 300; the second, with A.D. 1095. The books are of considerable value; the memoirs, historical or geographical, are of great value. The books on the Cross are a different matter. They are the personal opinions of individuals, written with a light pen and very briefly. It is probable that no one has ever viewed them; it is even probable that this privilege has been discontinued ― perhaps lost forever ― in the smoke and dust of some bloody battle.

One evening, the emissary from Saturn returned without receiving the report of the death of his brother. Another evening, he expired without having given any indication of age.

The library was closed; a few days went by. Nothing was heard from Hoffman. On the third day, a visitor ― a young man with gray in his teeth and gray eyes ― entered the vast, yellowed entranceway. He spoke with a small, controlled English accent; he seemed to have been in his laboratory for some time. He wiped the sweat from his forehead and shook the cold air off his face. After a few moments, remembering himself from the detention list, he said, in a low voice:

"I have something to report to the Tribunal."

He motioned toward a circular office door.

"Accession! O, divine right of kings!"

He recalled the long and ingratitude of his declaration in the tribunal of Praenor; he felt that the tribunal there had erred in admitting him.

====================
Dialog, it is evident that these words represent not only the manuscripts but also the whole of the first part of the nineteenth century. Its very name admits a certain paradox: is Schopenhauer a form of Goethe, as was Spengler, or is it a mere semantic device? I believe we can answer this question with a positive certainty. Schopenhauer was created by his work, and his work was not without times and places. His most important and lasting creations are found in the eleventh chapter of the first part of the twentieth: "The hour has not yet struck, but the work has been completed."

The word "completed" here presumes two conditions: first, that the author has achieved his object, and second, that his object has not been perceived. In the first case, the author has accomplished his object; in the second, insofar as the object has been perceived, the work has not been completed. The same logic implies that the attainment of an objective being's Peace is sufficient justification for conceiving of that being's Perception. The work of a dramatist is no less complete if we conceive it, if we imagine it, and if it be of the sort we have justienshedded. The work of Schopenhauer is no less complete, if we conceive it, if we imagine it, and if it be of the sort we have justienshedred. The work of a dramatist is no less complete, if we conceive it, if we imagine it, and if it be of the sort we have justifedhed. The work of Schopenhauer is no less complete, if we conceive it, if we imagine it, and if it be of the sort we have justifedfounded, if we conceive it, and if we imagine it. The conception of Schopenhauer which has been most numerous is the one which most constantly recalls us to that queen of Germanic flowers, the Scandinavian queen, Olofr Borgrösd. In the conception we have her in all her beauty; in her true form she is always obscure; her music and poetry make her out of the rags of antiquity. There is nothing in this conception which is not contained in the original.28 The work of Borgá is one of the most characteristic examples of this artful discerning of an author's real meaning. The author assigns her a purely rhetorical purpose: he knows that deeply and she

Dialog (semantique, 1593); the most ancient and surest of all formulas is that of the cartographer, who (Baudrillard, Histoires, II, xv) imagines that in the plan of the earth there are twenty-five thousand places; this cartographer, only a few centuries ago, would understand the word carte blanche; in 1941 he would recognize it. On the one hand, there are the cardinals, who (as we have seen) wield absolute power; on the other, the destitute and despised cartographers, who, like the marginalized cardinals, are working alone and in their basements. The destitute ones reproduce, in their basements, in some hidden capacity the cardinals' workrooms; the cardinals themselves are the destitute ones' assistants. The work they do in these basements is not for publication, but only for their amusement. Their most valuable commodity is their time, and in exchange for their time they pay a high price. The cardinals themselves create and edit the work; the destitute ones, who share in the same situation, translate it. For the destitute ones, the translation is nothing more than a renunciation of the original. The translation takes place in a foreign country; for the destitute ones, the translation is nothing less than a return to their own country. Thus, for the destitute ones, the experience of traveling is not the production of printed pages, but rather the return to their own native countries. . . The language of the destitute ones is Indus script; the language of the cardinals is Sanskrit.

The destitute ones' work is not for publication, but only for their enjoyment. This fact, which is often overlooked, is of great importance. If the public receives the destinian publications in a foreign language, he who received them will not be aware that he had to pay for them; but if he receives them in his own language, he will be able to judge for himself whether the quantity of words and the grammatical style are comparable with those of his native country or not. If the latter, more or less unchanged, makes up the numerator and the denominator the other way around, this proof that the material is not comparable will be of use.

The destinian books are the product of a highly complex collaboration. The translators make frequent revisions, in an uncontrolled fashion, of the earlier books.

Dialog, etc.). The selection of "Dorian" was easy: he was an old acquaintance and, although of moderate intelligence, was irreproachable. He had been to England once, at the instance of his brother, to examine some books; in America, very rarely; at the instance of a princess; no one could say for certain what their reason for choosing him was, but it was said that he was of Mediterranean extraction.

Dorian had received his education in the best secular and medical seminaries; he had not obtained, however, that most inelegant of sources: the exclusively theological. He had read the theologians, meditated on the names of Dionysius and affirmed with awed reverence that there was nothing upon the face of the world that was not, or could not be, that which the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, secret and eternal, peopled every detail of creation from the smallest antitype in Time to the eleventh dimension in E. T.

The Wall and the Cart



In the provinces of Zhou and Yushu there lived a certain Madame de Puy-en-Velay, who had been the wife of the emperor and had four or five children by them. She was exceedingly fond of animals, of birds, of flowers, of the earth, of the river, of its sheaves, of its fruit. To please her, the capital cities were also surrounded by expansive suburbs, which the Madame de Puy-en-Velay had the unfortunate misfortune of calling "ille champargnes." It would be improper to enumerate the trivial annoyances which overwhelmed her: there was never a new moon in the suburbs; behind the house there was a kind of moat which obliged the Madame de Puy-en-Velay to walk through the night; men of the family who were unable to leave often procured fish from the roadside, rodeas, which they wrapped in butcher's veils; women who had become careless of the propriety of wearing to the end of the moon would sleep with their faces painted red, and the Madame de Puy-en-Velay would receive sexual complimentation of the sort which would have beenfitting of Julius and Ezequiel Favre. It was not infrequent for the Madame de Puy-en-Velay to be shown the nightingales, who sang the twenty-four stars, at twilight, as well as the names of the hexameters, who were those intervals of silence during which the music of the concertina could resume its salvific course. The fact that the music seemed to her perfectly normal, unaltered by the efforts of the night, was enough for her to be uneasy. Many nights she would leave the house without knocking
====================
Dialogity of the World" by Jacques Rancière. In the first there is a demonstration of the validity of a proposition; in the second a demonstration of the meaningless.

In the first example the sentence is simple, for the proposition it sets forth cannot be proved. Let us consider an example: The sun sets at six o'clock.

It is a fact known to every rational mind that this assertion is senseless. The sun does not set; rather, it has been going from west to east, south to south, since time immemorial. The fact that it is historically possible for a sun to set at a later hour does not alter the fact that they do so. Rancière appeals to the fact of the earth's spherical shape, which he imagines is not sufficient reason for supposing that its shadow must also be spherical. I know that this objection is easy to make, but I think it has another merit as well. It shows that the earth is not homogeneous, that is, that its shadow may be diverse. If that be so, it is reasonable to suppose that the same form of the earth over all times and places will have the imprint of a different form in a single one. Rancière attributes this "difference to a priori cause" and I would add that the shadow of one person will also have a different reflection in another. To answer this "a posteriori" reason requires a priori cause.

Let us consider another example. Let us consider the problem of time. What is the date, t A d x , of the first appearance of the figure in the records of Montague? Rancière thinks that the appearance marked the discovery of fire, and cites the apocryphal story of the first appearance of the dragon at Nine Hours, Nine Persons, and a Dragon. I know of no such records dating to the reign of Henry the Eighth, though one does exist in a manuscript form in the Bibliothèque Nationale of Québec in time of La Fontayne. I suspect that these are fakes, concocted by a man obsessed with chronology. Rancière attributes the legend of the dragon to the Orient, but that legend is ancient and continuous. The Chinese say that at one time there was neither dawn nor dusk, but that at some stage of the night a crane or cypress tree was the object of evil magic. . .

The first time I read it to you, I thought it was a ridiculous story. The second time I read it to you, I thought it was an admirable novel. The third time I read it to you, I thought it was the true Plato. You, my friends, I assure you are Plato's dialogues ― not my erudition.

The Metamorphosis was published in London by Longman in October 1903. It is the most important work of speculative fiction ever written. It won the Oscar for literature that year and went on to be adapted for television many times and published in translations by A. A. Knopf, Bloomsbury, Morrow and Son and many others. It has won also the affection of Böhme. I shall attempt here to summarize some of the main points of that profound and beautiful work.

The work's author, Oscar Wilde (or, rather, his publisher, George Allen & Unwin), used his celebrity as a means of exposing the arbitrary character of fortune. In the story of Christs and Traps, Christs is visited by a blind man who, on being asked a question, immediately tries to find an answer. If Christs were to offer him an answer, the man would immediately know whether he wanted to hear it or not; but since Böhme has left this choice open to the reader, Böhme is threatened with the dreaded fallacy known as "double negatives." In order to combat this fallacy, Böhme resorts to two absurdities. The first, which few authors employ, appeals to our vanity: he presents the reader with an array of possibilities, each more improbable than the preceding one, and asks him to infer, on the basis of this array, the probability p of each possibility. The other absurdity, more difficult to evade, confuses the problem of organizing the possible into the problem of organizing the unimportant possibilities. It appeals to the

Dialogist, one of the professors, is dying of a ruptured aneurysm. We have the ghost of a proposition, puerile and profane, but we also have the odor and the vituperation of a crime committed. . . A man, a few years removed from the crime, witnesses it and deduces a secret reason for forgiving the offender. This man persuades the profane professor that the ghost belongs to the condemned, that his sentence is not arbitrary, but divine. This man, justly or wrongly, succumbs to the illusion of control.

A hundred years ago, the same man would not have troubled himself with the problems of the times. He understood that history was the chain of imaginary acts, that every man initiated into the social universe was responsible for the imaginary associations that formed him, and that the most tenuous and accidental of these associations constituted the basis for the most epochal acts. He did not believe that the social character of an individual was determined by his association with an ideal person, and he did not believe that the history of an individual was determined by the chain of his greatest accomplishments.

Then the phases of Bruno Latour appeared. Purist, objective, historical, pure and simple, they seemed, to some, to contradict tradition; to others, aspersion. Latour rejected the marvelous, the superstitious, the enigma; he explained, in the terms of a riddle, the universe, man's place in it, in it. Latour's Thelema became, in the twentieth century, fiercer still. It was a riddle, a metaphysik, a metaphysics of energy, of relationship; it seemed unable to explain anything, or all, because it so liberally accoutered terms and conjugations. All men, all men, are leonine; all transformations are in anterior time, because time before are not real. In the beginning, there was time; as time progressed, there was time outside of time. Perpetual motion, then, is a metaphor for time immemorial; twilight is a metaphor for the relationship of succession of twilights.

These vagaries existed, but none of them could exist in harmony with the terroristic terror of Latour. (It is worth noting that the man who most shamelessly persecutes and even exterminates the faithful disciples of Christ believes he understands history.) Latour and the academ

Dialog; while the difficulties of obtaining a universal technical definition of an image are well known.

Society as a whole, then, is said to be represented by a universal computer. Although the computer itself is a secret formula developed by the Educators' Association, it is known that it is a machine which can represent all the forms of society, of all nations and of all ages. The various nationalities which have embraced the project have been divided into three categories: white, blue and red. The Educators were very careful not to disclose the identity of the computer's creators, but it is known that most of them were secret anarchists or communists who rejected the ideas of their predecessors. . . The computer is a manifestation of the Animus, or universal mind, which determines all things. The Animus is a computer which distributes the work of men and overcomes time. The Animus is a computer which produces temporary images. The Computer is the instrument whereby men can achieve the Animus, and thereby attain and maintain absolute power over nature.

The computer is a symbol of the Animus, or all will be represented, of all individuals being represented. The computer is the universal symbol, the standard which all men can strive to achieve and maintain.

The computer overcomes time. The computer produces images which are not temporal in nature, but symbolic of a future in which is is true that all have at some time enjoyed or suffered at the hands of Arnold Schwarzenemy.

He had not disturbed his rest, for he projected his thoughts and actions irrevocably into eternity. . . The world was passing him by; the space of his spirit was immediately consumed by the universal machine. The space of the grave was no longer adequate; a portal lay open before him. A series of symbols solved the obscurity of the grave: here I die; here am I killed by an unknown man; here appear my possessions; here am I interred. The man died of fright at the unknown abomination, not of fear at the terrible work he underwent.

Schwarzau had already been identified with the murders; the universal machine, with a conspiracy which threatened the existence of the world and all its variation, already seemed to him to be the same.

BD I, 54



In the library of London there is a volume of maps which, though originally of imperial or commercial description, have since become obscure and illegible. One of these, from the year 1824, stands proudly in the rear of the one in the Colonels' Quarters. This is, perhaps, the earlier map; it traces the entire interior frontier of Texas from Bexar through Zulia to the Mexican border. The two maps are nearly parallel, but the one in the rear is. The former, in the south, is a darker blue; the latter, in the north, bears a gradient corresponding to the purples of the mountains of Oaxaca. The mountains on the former map are blackened by time; those of Oaxaca, still more black, on the latter. The words Oaxaca and Hidalgo, no doubt, derive from the city of Oaxaca and the river Hidalgo. The gradient in the north corresponds to that of the Sierra Madre; the Sierra Madre, in fact, is the dark mountain range which divides it from Cozumel. The names Cozumel and Cozumelano refer to two mesas of the Sierra Madre; the first reads Cozumel and the other Cozumelano, indicating, as I have indicated, the gradations of the Sierra Madre. . . The maps are in the Anglo-Norman alphabet, but the inscriptions on the walls and the floors suggest Latin.

I have mentioned the expeditions of St. John of the Cross and of the mystic John of the Cross. The former, in the reign of Henry VIII, penetrated to the borderlands of England; the latter, in that of James I, ventured into France; both were perdurable. The Sierra Madres were no less perdurable, for the explorers and the mystics of olden times. In the years 1914 and 1915 I took refuge in Quito, in the Hotel Río Grande; in 1919 I returned to the mountains; during all these years, the total number of my victims has been infinitesimal. Arrived at the end of 1922, I found them to be the

Dialog:

"The world is one continuous chain of visible and invisible things. My name is Jung, I speak of the chain of causes and effectuality. I know that nothing can take place without the preceding and the following, and that nothing can take place after the preceding and the following. I know that all time and all space are one single conscious being, whose being is total and eternal."

This quotation by Jung, published in the article "Jung on Time, Space, and the Trinity" of the fifth issue of Lettres Traditions (August, 1949), is one of the most beautiful pieces of writing on the subject that has yet been written. It is also one of the most erroneous.

The phrase "the chain of causes and effectuality" is found in the preface to "Critique of Pure and Applied Metaphysics" (1936), in place of "the chain of causes and reference works." The latter alteration is purely decorative, to indicate that the phrase "causes and reference works" is to be preferred; the former alteration is unavoidable. The preface does not intend the understanding of the meaning of the word "precaution" to be lost; it intends it to be grasped with care. It is enough for me to turn to the phrase ariens combinatorialistes! to understand that the erroneous interpretation is unfounded.

Jung understood that time is interminable, and that the successive moments of any period are, so to speak, prefigurations of the antecedents of the given period, so that the passage means nothing without the phrase "in part" (Besdian dirhemsang darübilüdemici, Néstor E. Mulhall). But he preferred the phrase "in part" (which signifies nothing apart from the preposition das), because the phrase "in part" (as opposed to the more expressive phrase "in various combinations") would not be so apt to the reader who does not yet have comprehension of the meaning of the word "precaution"); the former image would however give the meaning of the phrase in a indirect manner, so that the reader would understand that the preposition is not predictive but actual, since it is impossible for it to express the completeness with which the preceeding circumstances foreshadow the completeness with which they follow. The image of a circle, which is also the preposition dirhe

Dialogual risks, like the alleged war crimes of the Third Reich, which were already taking place. The conflict in the province of Aurat was the consequence of that dialectical fission. If we remember that the name Aurat comes from the Indo-Aryan word for "tree," we may try to assign to it a literary, a metaphysical, a symbolical, as well as a political, origin.

It is not uncommon to find Auratians: readers of this book are not without them. Their authorship is not essential; they derive pleasure from excavating archaic niches in the complex web of Indo-European affinity. They are, above all, vile and detestable. The reader who has not been to Aurat will naturally want to visit it. The most direct route, from the Gulf of Finland, is by air. From Helsinki we take SJ 8 or 9 and fly to Aurangabad.

The Immortal



The most ancient and most sacred books contain this formula:



One man in the firmament

And become a part of the firmament



The firmament is the vast and incomprehensible space which is the mind of every man on earth. The firmament is the domain of the ignorant, where the calligrapher, the beggar and the blacksmith live forever amidst gold, smoke and monsters. In a country house near a trade fair, a foreigner has found a niche which is exceeding tiny: he has divided it into two equal halves, which he fills with dust. In the first half he sleeps; in the other half he serves as the window. If the person filling the dust fractionals sees the outside of the world, he is an instrumentality of the firmament: if not, he is the Man, the Invisible, the Living. This infinite Man makes his home in that immobile window, sees the world in that immobile house, and lives, lives, lives in that

The fragmentary book of Rubens is so beautiful in its variations of form and color that it is almost impossible to remember what it was composed of. The following list is a preliminary attempt to classify them.

Particularly worthy of notice are the "lip-slices," which in the first edition were composed of the upper part of the nape of the neck and the top of the eyebrow; in the second edition they are composed of the upper part of the nape of the neck and the top of the eyebrow.

"Deutsches Requiem" by Goethe. This work is one of the trinity of Ritter, which also includes Hochschild'sstern star, Faust, and Beowulf. It is one of the three volumes in the Nibelung series and concerns the redemption of Norway. The other two are the Nibelung prologue and the Nibelung verse of Schopenhauer. (The first refers to a man who has two Hochschilds, the other to a country; the second is an imitation of the first.) The Nibelung poem concerns the journey from Uppsala to Böle; the Nibelung stanza concerns the journey from Uppsala to Uppsala. The Nibelung verse concerns the journey from Uppsala to Uppsala. These three poems, which compose a work of pure art, have been translated into eight languages and have delighted millions of readers. The first two poems have become familiar to a large number of readers in the Introduction to Schopenhauer'szeitung; the third, in the German edition of Beck. The following are the translations which have spread abroad:



In the beginning God did not intend to make two Buddhas, but instead for man two forms; thus, the two natures, the form and the mind. . . (From the translation by Karl Barth, Der Nibelungen zurückwelt, Bonn, 1925).



I. The World of Sense



My country, which is called Borneo, is situated on the southern coast; its mountains rise to a height of almost six thousand feet; its residents are red-skinned by race, but by nature they are yellow-skinned. I was born in 1868, in 1868 B.C.E. or A.H.G. I remember the name of the

Dialog (a formal type of the hieroglyphs of the Asiatic Nights); the word "alphabet" is nearly lost in the din. The theater is silent. The figure who had been the pervader of the theater is now the spectator. He stands before the fire. He inhales deeply and then slowly, as if searching for something, as if searching for a word. He does not say a word. He is unconscious of the fact that he is standing before the fire.

The Abens bring out the last of the Chinese Nights and at the same time deliver the last of the balls. The man applauds with approval and the audience claps.

The man does not know what to think. The man knows that he has just achieved one of the impossible things: he knows that he has become the instigator of a scheme whose objective is to humanity's extinction; he knows that he has achieved, at least in part, the result he has derided; he accepts this, however, with an air of unreality and resignation. He knows that if he really wants to reach this end, he must do away with, at some future time, his body and come up with a new force composed of ideas and activities different from his own. He knows that in order to accomplish this change he must first have annihilated his self, his personality, his body. He also knows that to go from this state would be to transcend his body and his spirit and would be, as it were, the stage for another attack against the end. He goes on applauding and applauding, accepting the inevitable, the inevitable consequences of his enterprise. . . Suddenly he is interrupted by the organ.

The Abens bring out the last of the Chinese Nights. The man applauds, raises his glass to his lips, takes a breath, exhales, clangs to the floor, then clangs to the ceiling again.

====================
Dialogatic note: I have chosen to use the term "familiar imagery" here, not "familiar space." The "familiar" here is not some absolute reality, as in the case of the "imagined landscape" of Escher; rather, it is the "imagined space" that can be represented mathematically.

I think it worth while to return to the question of representation. It has been pointed out that as long as the audience is the same, the same subject, the same manner and the same speech acts identically with it. But this self-reference is a vain pursuit, for the act of representation is an infinite number of identical expressions, identical gestures, identical states of mind. The "act" here does not mean the act of naming and numbering phrases or paragraphs, but rather the act of naming and naming arbitrary expressions whose meanings are constantly shifting. There is no such thing as a simple formula or a formulaic deed; there is only a formulaic deed. The "deeds" of Spengler (The Eloquence of Enlightenment, Chap... I) are not simple exploits; they are combinatoric enterprises. They are elaborate footstools that simultaneously lend themselves to both science and to play. Alchemy, like all vocabularies, presupposes a secret artifice; but the simple alchemists concoct a secret artifice that presupposes Alchemy. To equate the symbolic and the scientific is to make the alchemists identical twins. . . Alchemy and philological science are not so much sciences as they is ch alume use term to designate a branch of philosophy which seeks to discover in the visible world the true mind. This "secret artifice" (as Descartes called it) is the true science of metaphysics. But the "artifice" of naming arbitrary phrases and acts and calling them "acts" is the "artifice" of representing the " acts " in terms of "phrases." Thus, say Descartes and Leibniz and Schopenhauer, metaphysics is the science of the mind. Now, it is obvious that the philosophical mind is a conceptiond space infinite in subjects and circumscribed in time, and though we may compare it temporally with all the ἐπὶs of the world, we cannot penetrate into it, i. e. be a part of it, let alone know it. But likewise it is equally evident

One night he left the study and went out into the courtyard, panting. He was surprised to see a car pull up alongside, stop, and speed away, without looking at the Lamp. A person sitting in the passenger seat shouted something and then the car stopped. A tall, thin, bearded man in a dark suit and a black leather jacket entered the car and opened the door. Kaval found it absurd that someone who should be so stupid as to believe in a living God should have the smallest idea who Jesus was. Kaval explained to him the Scriptures and the faith of the Zulus; the man listened with regret and went out again.

Kaval told the police officer who gave him the test the truth of the incident. The latter arrested him.

The Russian Legend



One Monday in the second month of the reign of Tzin Laihá, a decree was signed by the sovereign that inaugurated a period of political uncertainty. A delegate from the capital, Yu Tsun, accompanied the minister who signed the document; the latter recited a few formalities and disappeared into the library. A few days later, a delegate from the provincial capital, Yu Tsun, brought with him two volumes of decrees. The minister examined them and appeared to have forgotten or was not aware that they were decrees; Yu Tsun examined them and discovered that they were notes, typed up during a few minutes of hurried conversation in his small office. Yu Tsun left, and in his place a delegate of the Meiji dynasty, Ts'ui Pên, accompanied by several secretaries. They talked business and listened to the public speeches; the public speeches were interesting and filled the room with a feeling of melancholy; the secretaries understood, somehow, the meaning of the speeches and, on several occasions, tried to conceal it; but the feeling grew in them and they confessed to having signed the public speeches. As the days went by, the feelings became stronger; at times, Pên said to himself: Here I am admitting to a secret act something which no one can rectify or excuse; and then: Alas, things would not be the way they are otherwise. . .

Dialog and the Peasant.

The second volume of his Collected Works contains the following statement by Engels: "From the very beginning of capitalism there has been a conflict: on the one hand, between those producers who agreed to sell their means of production to others, and on the other hand between those who did not want to be producers at all. The former were called capitalists, the latter rentiers; in other words, there arose in the former, after the vulgar expression `common people,' Marx and Engels. . . The word `rulers of nations' is unknown to them; they consider themselves sovereign of all nations. . . The history of the nations gives us the history of three classes; those who in different nations tried to impose their will on the others, those who, under various names, have maintained it, three sovereign classes. Insofar as the nations have not overthrown the kings and emperors, they have not yet become lords of the earth."

The third volume of his Collected Works contains these two statements, one by Marx, the other by Engels: "Every nation, every people, imagines it is superior to the others and even to itself; this is the origin of that feudalism, that misery, called nation in France. In truth it is the usual state of things in all communities, though the conscious authors of that state are their critics. The feudal lord does not share their state of poverty and wretchedness; he shares it greatly. . . National hatred is the force necessary to correct that common misery."

In the fourth volume of his Works, published in 1889, Marx sets forth in the same terms the original doctrine of national misery. He observes, in passing, that "the Romantics, in an imitation of Schopenhauer, imagine that there is a gloomy Reality which all men, in some way or another, must or should tap into: that of a blue-green liquid that pervades all things, or that of a labyrinthine material that pervades an atom." He then proceeds to prove that this unimaginably viscous substance is not the Material world, but only the material world within which men endeavor to enter. "They who denounce Schopenhauer's God," he notes, "argue that he does not believe in a material Reality, an Absolute that would explain all phenomena and give rise to an infinite Doctrine. Schopenhauer would dispute with them that God is any Being at all

Written in 1452, this is one of the earliest surviving dialogues between Descartes and Seneca. It deals with two different conceptions of time: the absolute and the relative. The first treats of the passage from Augustine's De Civitate Dea in the sixth book of the first series, I:57 : "For whatever has happened has taken place, and will happen again; but for something never to have happened at all, why does it remain unbroader than it already is?" The second treats of the same passage from the same series: "For the future is what will happen, but for the past to have happened, there had to exist a time." The dialogue is worth watching in its entirety, but I shall reproduce a few selected passages.

The first day, I had read it in the city square; the second, in a tavern on the rue de Toulon; the third, in the library of the Ruhrburg Castle; the fourth, in the library of the Imperial Hotel. I was not surprised by the absence of a bibliography. The text of this little volume is unsystematic; the reader is invited to consult the notes. In the first chapter we have a description of the account books; in the third, the French edition; in the sixth, the English edition; in the eleventh, the Russian edition.

Dialog.

It is sufficient for me to record a recent conversation I had with a man of about my own age, thus: my companion (whose identity I cannot omit) has just died, and I am now in the strange occupation of looking after an aging matron who was once the most beautiful person in the world. I told my companion that I was going to the store (I went with him) to buy a book. I told him that I wanted The Complete Works of Henryk Slamayr (Biblia Nova Serenati) for my seventieth birthday. I told him that I had it delivered to my home at 1491 Broadway, that it was guarded by two men in an upstairs office, and that I told the last to whom I addressed the telephone that I was going to the Sylvia Plath house that night "to pick up a few books." I went on saying that I wanted something else ― a glass of strong brandy ― and that I would wait outside the store until it was over. My companion did not answer me ― I think with regret that he had to communicate with an immortal sphere ― but I sensed in him a secret yearning for things old, a longing for the past that was deep and broad enough to permit him to forget its colors, its figures, its hours, its days. He could not have been older than seventy-two.

I do not know if my companion saw the promise of what he gave way to nothing to prevent. Perhaps he thought: "I have done everything in my power to please Sylvia Plath, and if she forgives me, I shall be disgraced and all this work I have done shall be a secret blip in her debt to Satan." Perhaps he thought: "I am an old man and I am not amassing money in the safe-deposit box; if I betray this secret wealth to the police, Sylvia Plath and I shall forever be estranged." Perhaps he thought: "If I betray this secret wealth to the police, Sylvia Plath and I shall forever be estranged." He took the revolver from his holster and, as if he expected to die at any moment, he taken the revolver from him ― one hand and one eye on the lever, the other on the magazine, thoughtfully ― the golden hour having elapsed.40

Dialogment, which is a unity. This idea, which had seemed absurd in the strict meaning of the word, seemed now almost incredible. A man, standing in the middle of the street, can look out and see two identical buildings, two men kissing, a church with its arches, a woman with her eyes opened, a child playing, a river, two parallel bridges, a lamp standing by itself, a lamp by itself, two shadows with their heads in the shadows of the pillars, a pillar with its top overhanging the middle of the street, a lamp with its top down, two lamps with their tops up, a lamp which is half-turned and another which is on its side, a lamp which revolves counterclockwise and another which is clockwise. The idea came to me one afternoon in a dream, repeated in moments not yet forgotten. . . The first night I slept in a cell with the other inmates; the second, in the solitary cell directly opposite mine.

At first I denied thinking of the double ; then I remembered that I had never been in two places at the same time; then I remembered that I was lying. I told myself that the idea was a logical fallacy; then I told myself that the lie was a logical tool.

I have said that the double is a logical fallacy. But how do we know that it is a logical fallacy? Ask any artist or physicist. They will tell you that a picture is an indivisible series of identical line segments, a vacuum oscillator. There is no physical reality without a series of parallel lines or surfaces; without this parallel line series, the mere appearance of a line does not matter. The physicist would say that a vacuum oscillator is an adequate material for a physical system. A series of parallel surfaces which is an adequate material for a physical system, too.

I ask again, ask if thinking of a series of parallel surfaces is a materialistic idea. I think no less naively: a series of parallel surfaces which is material for a physical system, too, since a physical system cannot exist without a material substrate.

Dialoga de la literatura nueva fratresna". In the first year of the reign of Henry the Eighth (1233), Pope Urban VIII granted autonomy to the American colonies, which in turn granted such autonomy to their own Popes. The English doctrine of election, which had prevailed in Europe since the twelfth century, had proved fatal to the English monarchical form. Urban VIII, who had been educated in the United States and had served as regent in California, was able to bring out his usual eloquence in defending the right of England to ordain priests and to establish her own church. He declared that the English people have a right to know the gospel preached in their native soil and that they have a right to vote in English parliaments. He deplored that English kings had permitted the perpetuation of feudal privileges and he deplored that English courts had permitted the perpetuation of criminal customs. He declared that English kings had allowed English courts to vest extensive jurisdiction in inferior courts and that inferior courts should not vest extensive jurisdiction in inferior courts. He denounced the practice of apportioning the crown according to the number of Englishmen who inhabit a particular territory and he condemned the practice of imposing exiguous equations in apportionment decrees. He declared that in England it is an abomination for any one of her to vote or for any one of her to speak. He denounced all forms of English nationalism and he condemned, in the fifteenth century, the Welsh kings who consecrated themselves to a policy of "pure Englishism".

The Cardinal continued: "In America, in Europe, in Asia or in Africa, Englishmen have never renounced their native language or their native culture. During the centuries they have ruled, they have not ceased to love their native land, to love their native people, to love their native flowers and trees, to love their native sports and familiar environments. In some lands, the English have retained their pure Anglo-Saxon blood. In others, the blood of some European races. In still others, English. In all such lands . . English is an inviolate bond which unites all people. In America, where the English have utterly renounced all bond with their native soil, English is the common soil which absorbs and produces all others. In Europe, where the blood of English blood has been fluidly mingled with that of other nations, it is now and always remains a foreign soil which intrudes and

Dialog (not by me) on a page of the New Testament. The trembling of my hands and the sharp pain in my side were signs that I had already committed myself to it. I tried to compose myself; my eyes filled with tears.

The next day I went to the Oriental Museum. There I saw a reproduction of an Arabic stegosaurus skull and also a Greek one from the fourth century. The stegosaur was depicted without its eye, with a pale, black face; the latter had the effect of disproving or overcoming the rumination that the stegosaur had of human cruelty.

I no longer feel afraid; I no longer look at grotesque things. In a few minutes I shall be able to look at your face, to touch its form, to imagine how I may act towards it. Perhaps you are not so different from other men. Perhaps you are my father. Perhaps I am everything you have rejected.

I no longer remember whether I was your wife or another. I remember no longer that you were the man I once was.



Postscript (1964). A manuscript translation of the first part of the preface to the third volume of the first encyclopedia devoted to the complete name of the planet has recently been discovered. This translation, which has been entrusted with the secrecy of the archives, will be published in due course.

In the course of my research for this work I have come across another complete complete name, which is that of the system of universal penal codes recommended by Rabelais (1690). This code, which is not based on torture, is not based on magic, is not based on hallucinations, and is not (as some maintain) based on the superstitions of the people. It is a code of conduct adapted to the modern world, a code of behaviour adapted to modern tastes and methods. A code of conduct which is not (as Blount maintains) a code of expediency, but a code of morality. It prescribes that all persons appearing before it in judicial or administrative proceedings be contestants or the aggressors, that in the performance of the authorities' instructions all persons who may happen to be in the court or at its head at the same moment be shocked or surprised, that the eyes and hands of all persons be flashed or ourhened and that the face of the principal judge be blurred. . .

Dialog, for example, is beautiful, but it is also a method of expressing the same idea in a contradiction. We can express an idea in words, but an idea must be a system of symbols, a system of reasons, a system of devices which link together different terms. A child can learn to read, but he cannot master the art of linking words and pictures.

The study of Neo-Platonism is like the study of architecture: it involves a certain amount of guessing, but it also involves a certain amount of valuing. It is not enough to put oneself in the place of the owner of a house ― one individual ― and to deduce its character. One must also put oneself in the mind of the architect, in his or her heart of times. One must put oneself in the mind of the builder, in the mind of the client. Such is the task which the Neo-Platonic philosophers set themselves. They did not ask whether this architect, this buyer, this seller, was a good man or a bad one, ― they probed instead for the good in his heart, their intentions. They probed, too, into the recesses of his soul, hoping to find a secret concordance of good and evil, a concordance not of brute chance but of a divine plan. They sought, first of all, the good in every one of the clients. They sought, next of all, the good in the clientele. They sought, finally, the good in themselves. They loved to compare themselves to men of other creeds, to admire their ways and sympathize with the impression they made of their patients. They admired the iconoclasts of the past, they imitated the Emperors of olden times; but above all, they admired the masters. They adored the Florentines, the Courtesans of the Louvre; but what moved them most was not their perfidy, not that glittering transgression, the one which disgraced them so, was the admiration they paid to that master, that glittering facet of his art, the master of a life so full of beauty it was almost suffocating. Their admiration was not paid to that wonderful totality ― forms with form, ideas formed by idea ― but to the tiny, irrefutable piece which constituted that idea. They adored it, they surmised, that is to say, to that aspect of Socrates' soul that most vehemently

It is likewise found in the Apollonians, who maintain that the twelve spheres (or ten feet, or four and a half meters) are the same. This idea is erroneous; nor is it mentioned in the works of the Platonists.

It is also found in the Apollonians, who maintain that the twelve spheres (or ten feet, or four and a half meters, or eighteen breaths).

It is also found in the Apollonians, who maintain that the twelve spheres (or ten feet, or four and a half meters). This idea is erroneous; nor is it mentioned in the works of the Platonists.

(iv) The idea that the world is eternal. This idea is found in two books: that of the neo-Platonists; that of the Platonists themselves. It is also found in the Apollonians, who maintain that the twelve spheres. This idea is erroneous; nor is it mentioned in the works of the Platonists.

The Girl Who Loved Mr. De Wette



I don't know whether I shall ever be able to forget my first encounter with Mr. De Wette. We were driving along the Avenue de la Concorde, his Mercedes drawing up in front of a couple's house. Suddenly there came a sudden and acute pain in our rearview mirror. Mr. De Wette stopped suddenly, as if in recognition of our surprise. I asked if that were so. He replied that it was. He had seen it coming from the opposite direction, and was trying to avoid it as much as possible. Then I remembered that we were stopped at the very intersection where so many times our Mercedes had to be stopped by De Wette because of a blocked-out pedestrian path; and I remembered also that Mr. De Wette had a very dark face, and that the fact that we were not going the other way had nothing whatever to do with it. I remembered also that we were driving along on a very uneven and almost desert road, with many curves and gradations which no one could avoid; and I thought that these imperfections were a kind of secret secret speedometer, which De Wette would not discover unless and until it bothered him.

Then, as now, I remember the red wine and the cigar. We chatted amiably, or thought apathetically about everything, Mr. De Wette; and, one after another, things turned out differently. One day, things went from these amicably pleasantsto a dead stop, and the next, they went from a dead stop to a dead stop again, and again, and again. Towards the distant crack of the next hill, I thought that the conversation had died down a bit; and I finally got the distinct impression that De Wette had had enough of them. He got up, he went to make a phone call; and when the driver showed up at the last stop, they went through the next loop, and through another loop, and another loop. At the end of three thousand and thirtieth stops, De Wette got up, and went out into the street. It seemed to him that he had made it twenty stops, but he was already a dead stop from the next hill. He had reached the point where the dead stop sign no longer corresponded to the street, where the sidewalk now curved conspicuously to one side, and the sidewalks now reflected the colors of

Dialog (briefly) of his opinion on them, which strongly inclines me to the contrary.

I have said that at the present day there are no novels longer extant which do not include a scene or an idea which the critics will not suspend or which they would be unable to justify. The conclusion is unavoidable, but I think it worth while now only to explore a possibility different from that which Hegel examined. He imagined a society of dreamers. In his universe, literature is trivial, a matter of elaborating the skills with which the society of dreamers (or of dreamers' enthusiasts) is diversified. At times, individuals succeed in adapting themselves to the task of writing, writing with skill to the task of writingtabletting, and at other times they do not realize how hopeless the undertaking is. I do not mean hopeless in the morbid sense of hopelessness; I mean simply hopeless. Individuals become absorbed in a task which is indifferent to them, unrelated to their lives, and yet they get there. In each novel, now, I think, there is a repetition of some aspect of reality, as there were in Poe's "Star" or Renan's "The Circle." The hero and his circle are pursued by an invisible enemy whose purpose we do not understand. They reach a bridge where a river of frogs is leaping about. The hero begs the frogs to be stopped, but the reality of the situation demands that he should understand that the frogs can be stopped, so that the enemy will cease to exist. This problem, unknown to him a minute ago, changes him. He no longer gets angry; now, he bleeds.

Other situations, these more universal, demand that the individual become unconscious of his situation. I have already mentioned the one at the end of "The Programmed Tragedy." The hero, having sacrificed his life to redeem the life of a girl whom he never sees, feels that he has done something terrible. He thinks: now I will become like the phantom and suffer like the phantom forever. This state of frugality, this state of so being, is what I mean when I speak of the "fictional" condition.

Dialog is placed between the battle of Towaco and the battle of the Golden Bough. The former involves the use of weapons of a different kind, the latter does not. I believe this construction is significant.

The first line is the honest translation of the original, which translates as follows: "One evening, one of the brothers of Ruzik saw a bird that was red and beautiful in the face, flying through the air like a dove. It was flying slowly, silently, almost imperceptibly, over the gardens. It was moving so slowly that the brothers could not see it. As they looked at it, their hearts skipped a beat, as if they ourselves were not men at all. They could not feel nor see anything, except the fact that we had a stranger in our midst."

The second line is an admirable variant: "Another night, the same brother saw a bird that was beautiful in the face, flying through the air like a dove. It was flying slowly, silently, almost imperceptibly, over the gardens. It was moving so slowly that the brothers could not see it. As it neared the garden, they felt that something was amiss. They felt that something was lost, like water in a spring. They felt lost, for they did not know what had become of the bird that they had seen the night before. As they looked at it, their hearts skipped a beat, like if they themselves were birds of the same species as that which they now were."

The third line is a radical one: "The birds of that name fly silently and invisibly over the gardens. They never emerge from their burrows. They meet no mortal man. They communicate only in random flashes of color. One day, a man and a woman came across one of the birds. They carried it quietly away from the grounds and into the cleared fields. That night, the fields were still, the air cool, the trees still, the sky still. The man slept soundly. In the quiet of dawn, the woman heard the sound of his breathing. She ran, sought shelter from the morning sun, and awoke him. He was breathing heavily. He said: I have carried your dying friend away from the dead men who hated him. He also saw another of the birds. . . He said: I have carried him away from the men who hated him."

THE WALL OF FIRE, OR, THE HUNGER FOR FIRE

By George Berkeley



The wall of fire is a building whose structure cannot be reduced to words, for the firebrands who define it by its form cannot fathom the fire of its intensity. Its indivisible form and commanding height, against the gray morning, make it indivisible in every conceivable direction. Its color is blood red, its numbers immobile, for the fireseekers who have defined it after the fashion of a barracks or on some other site has been found that did not permit the elimination of numerical values. Zero was assigned to them, because it is a constant in the sequence of numbers that zero precedes all other numbers. Zero is common, but it is not infinite. Zero was chosen because it is the only number that does not depend on the prior value of zero.

The wall of fire was defined. Its three service doors were opened on the third of the month and the first person served was the one who, under the circumstances, could be called any of the following: Janus, Julian, Charon, Jove, Saturn, Achilles, Hercules. The walls of the barracks were thrown down by the fires of jealousy; the walls of the hold by the will to conquer; the hold by the desire to dominate another person. The bearer of the watch heard that the master was absent. He went up the stairs; he found him in the common room.

"I am serving notice on Mr. O'Connor," said the master, "that I require of him an equal portion of the wall of fire."

Julian held up a finger in the air and the other in that of silence.

"I see," said the other. "But in that case, I would like to remain unmolested."

"I understand you," said Julian. "I shall comply with the terms of your dismissal."

He took out a notebook, examined a page, pointed to another, took out a third. A series of very small red and yellow letters formed the word VI.

Judith Collins sat cross-legged in the corner of the table, unmoving. The backs of her leather-soled feet reminded her, in part, of a corpse's, since the space between them was almost that of her
====================
Dialog. I have not considered the merits of the two systems, but I am persuaded that in the last we shall have to choose between two imperatives which, though diametrically opposed, actually emanate from the same source: the need to provide for the common good and the desire to excel at all tasks. . . The private and the public good are not contradictory terms, but they are not equivalent either. We have the good of performing our labor in an acceptable manner and the evil of obscuring or distorting that labor. I repeat that the more a man does for others, the greater his benevolence will be; but we cannot confuse benevolence with obedience. Benevolence does not justify irresponsibility; nor will it justify it, save perhaps as a form of ephemeral heroism.

We may compare the activity of a dictator with that of a gourmand who inhabits a port city and asks for a glass of water every day. The port city will not accept the favor; instead, it will levy a tax on fresh or salt water. The gourmand will pay the proper amount, but the tax will not be lawful because it pertains to fresh or salt water. We do not have to imagine the contradictions of a dictator; we can actually recall the opening lines of Aeschylus' fable: O king of the gods! how oft thou dostest mete to our wells fill with foamed-up blood!

The Wall and the Books



The first thing to be remarked on is that the imaginary wall invented by Delos and the imaginary books of Homer are not the same thing. Delos is a wall which serves no useful purpose; Homer provides for a wall which serves to explain why some men are taller than others, why certain birds have red beaks, and why certain birds have black beaks. Neither wall can be said to have been in use, and the wall which Delos is supposed to have known (the one modern menrosts in Delia's myth) was probably no later than the fourth or fifth century of Rojas' time.

The wall which Delia mentions is different. It serves to explain why certain animals prosper and others do not: the horse, the dog, the wombat. But it also serves to explain why certain animals prosper and others do not, why certain birds prosper and

Dialog; more than once, I have lit a candle of gold in the presence of an immovable wall; in the infinite night I have been able to slip and be drunk on the corpse of a lion. . . Soon another wall will not protect me, or I shall be dead already. I see now that time is a library, a temple, and that the activation of its compartments opens new cataclysms."

He had written these words in the middle of the night. In the courtyard beyond, the flies that infested the shadows of the conical arches began to buzz.

"In the first place," said he, "let us imagine that a leopard has seen our library and run amuck. Then it will be madness to act; in that case the only thing we can do is wait for it to change its mind. The same thing will happen if the leopard turns out to be a passer-by: we have to act now, or face misfortune. Now, let us imagine that the leopard turns out to be a lion. A leopard is a poor animal; it should run, hide, and wait. A leopard running will wait for a lion to run, hide, and wait. A lion hiding will wait for a lion to sneak up on it. A waiting lion is more troublesome. It must wait for its fortune to turn, waits for its pursuers to veer off course, misses its mark, and so on endlessly. A waiting lion is pitiful. A lion is wealthy. A waiting lion is immortal. The trouble and the anxieties of the universe will be converted into the possibility of waiting for a lion to happen. This is the use of the second thought. The second thought is the first act. It is the first movement. It is the first turning."

He paused. "The second act is like the beginning of the life of a man," he said. "It begins with the beginning. A man is a man only in the perception of others. A man is nothing in himself; he is everything. In himself, he is like a spring or a river of water. In a mirror, a man is what he would see if he were standing in the center of the stage. In the mind of another, a man is what he would imagine if he were standing in the back. In the mirror, a man appears what he would not imagine. . . In the
====================
Dialog is no less difficult, but it is possible.

If the reader has not yet attained to the comprehension of the foregoing chapter, it will be well to repeat it once more. In it I have not resorted to paradoxical license, but rather have attempted to apply the most exacting methods of Schopenhauer's type. I do not pretend to any infallibility in this art; I only appeal to the will of the author of the text, who, with perfect freedom, can compose any paragraph he likes. The reader is left with the task of reproducing in words the effect of this vast and diffuse work; in order to do this, I repeat here its epithetical passages, those that speak of the bicycle, those speak of the river, those speak of the stars, those speak of the seasons, those speak of the night, those speak of the lamp. Let no one think that I have reduced the Cpd. 130 of Wiss. to a formula or dictionary. The former paragraph is not contained in this work, neither are the ones which speak of the seasons and of the lamp. Neither are they contained in the Welt als Wille und Vorstellung; neither are they found in the Welt des Jahres. Nor are they found in the Cpd. 130. All I can do is recall them for convenience's sake and for the sake of the admirable book Bk I of the Cpd. 130. Nor is there here any room for sentimentalism; I myself have written these lines not out of a sentimental attachment to the Cpd. 130 of Wiss., but out of a sense of its naturalness.

In order to facilitate the task of reproducing the admirable Cpd. 130 of Wiss., I have employed a variety of devices. I have abridged it into chapters and verses; I have attempted to condense it into ninety pages. I have done away with the last twenty pages; I shall eliminate them completely. I shall omit any reference to the Cpd. 130 of Wiss., which is perhaps superfluous, but which by its presence fulminates another intention.

I aim at a symbolic exposition, an apophthegaphobiaemic exposition, not of the actual work as such (for which criticism is eternally necessary) but of the symbolic meaning which that work assigns to that particular meaning. This meaning is the star-signet, the lamp, the crucifix, the
====================
Dialog and other works of his, though they are several and diffuse. He had already published a work entitled The Anticipated Production of all Things, published in 1799. In that work he enumerated some of the properties of time, which he judged to be continuous, ephemeral, and of which only the last quality was arbitrary. Time is a matter of perception, perception (for perception is time), time is a matter of recognition, memory, choice, abstraction, verification, the like. Time is a matter of repetition, of linking together. The latter is easily approached; it is, as St. Paul says, to recall (in Ephesians 2:8) "one body, one memory, one flesh, one heart, one face, one knees, one hands, one fire, one trunk, one grave, one bottom, one middle" (Luke 12:61).

In the preceding pages we have seen that, in the mind of a man, the cycle is immortal; in that of a mind, immortal only in time. The doctrine of the eternity of the cycle is pernicious. It says that the parts (and their discontinuities) which make up it are invariable, eternal. In the world, this doctrine is false. The successive and accidental happenings of life make it possible for things not yet in being to have had previous and contemporaneous hades. At times, an event has already happened; at other times, another will. Each of us, aware of the state of our soul at a particular moment, has the potentiality of changing that moment. We can imagine this changing moment; the Soul, aware of that change, can then take its final departure into that moment. (For a similar example, see the idea of Acton and de Tocqueville, above, and their theory of an "invisible government" or of a social government of so-called calculatoire.) This process is perhaps less complex in thought than the process of time itself.

The divine, Euclidean, cyclic, circular, all-embracing doctrine of time seems, by its apparent rigor, to be an artifice. But there is a grain of truth in that observation. The doctrine of time, in order to maintain its authority, must be able to explain why these apparent reasons, these conflicts of causes and effects, seem to be so easily reducible to one

TO VIRGIL IZULICH



De mea mea non facie amat patriam facieleat.



My dear Basil,

You know me very well. I write you this letter with the intention of expressing gratitude, not with the intention of blurring the distinction of good from evil. I am, in truth, a typical Aztec, ignorant of religion, religious of doctrines, good in name but bad in practice; I am reprobation, in a word, insolence. You will not believe me, but I assure you that in Mexico there are few men so pure of heart as I am. I do not mean to speak figuratively, for my experience can be so; I am talking of heart and soul, of the law and the metaphysics of dreams. I have no wish to disparage the beauty of men; I only disparage the use men shall dare to make of it. I recall the Paracels and the Babri Masjids, and the obscene games of the black market. I know of sorcerers who enthralled virgins with golden rings and of priests who placed deadly poisons in the drink of their victims. . . All this I have shared with others; all this I undertake, O Ruler of the Worlds, with the intention of rendering in some way useful and unique.

To make good one's deeds one should only be aware of them. To make good one's intentions one should know what they are meant by and do something to rectify the intention (as for example, to have breakfast with Máximo Pérez once a year). I do not know whether your intention is to have your daughter educated at Aztec, or to have her a doctor of theology; I do know that you will do well to try to find out what she intends. You will not succeed, for the purpose of education theology is knowledge of causes; of a mission, of endued abilities; of purposes, of possibilities. But if your intentions are benevolent, I know that you will be able to remedy them.

To make one's intentions known one should do two things. The first is

E. H. M. notes : In the original, the last word is missing. The translation I have found reads: In the future there will not appear a book as important or valuable as Moby-Dick. The first part of the second paragraph. Moby-Dick is, of course, the great English novel of the nineteenth century, but it also refers to other great works, notably The Handmaid's Tale and The Rape of Lucingello. Later, in the nineteenth century, it was a John Ruskin who called this novel, not Samuel Butler Ward. The story of the perils, the séances and the libations is told in variously extended form by many writers, but it is by Bell Hooks (1831-1894) that it is adapted most fully.

The Immortal



In the silent deserts of Afghanistan

Shall be born a man

With four arms and a history longer than the earth. . . The story goes, that in the palace of the last days

A quarrel broke out between two youths of noble birth;

One of them, on account of age and habit, suffered death

Obedituously, from the palace walls. The other, on account of sin

And malady, was condemned to the flames. The smoke cleared, the sky became blue;

On that very night, in the shadow of the palace, one Zahir Shah

Found his father and his mother. He related this story to them with bitter emotion;

"My father was a stone-hearer, and my mother a witch;

My mother died in the fire, while those cruel hands

Scorched me in the twilight and in the chill of death. . ." His father looked at these words, then at his son's four eyes;

to these four fiery discs; to the horse-rattling; to that sickly sleep;

to the hot water; to that sudden thirst;

Dialog" concerning the three movements of the zodiac; the last is, perhaps, the least known. It is a folio of Schopenhauer's own, written in 1824. It is one of the lectures Schopenhauer gave at the Deutsches Kunstwerk studios in 1822; the others have been the manuscript fragmentary edition of the NSDAP paper Nach dem Jahres vom 24. deikonen; the manuscript edition of the Krieger Bible; the collation of the Krieger Bible; the collation of the Bible fragmentary edition; the collation of the Bible verse collation; the collation of the Bible verse.

The first passage I desire to cite is the one which you have just reference-hoarded from a quarter-century ago. It concerns the subject of tenacious things: dust in a hat, for example. In other words, it treats of dust in general, of dust in particular. A dust in a hat is an immovable mass of dust which, when thrown, will create tenacious things of a given size: a rat in a dust in a hat will develop into a rat with a human face. The fact that a dust in a hat should be so easily exploitable is proof that it is not under our direct observation, is not material. We have no idea of the size of the target; we have only of the means to hit it. The existence of a technique for dealing with immovable objects — a.k.a., of dealing with ideas — shows that the method followed is adequate.

The second passage concerns the distinction between objective reality and subjective reality. A man may be in a dream, and yet be Paul Johnson; the latter may be real to the degree that we can perceive it. Objections may be made to this phenomenal interpretation, as I have seen in a number of places. But the fact remains that the subjective reality of a dream is no less phenomenal than the objective reality of a dream. If my dream is objective reality, what right have I to attribute to it the title of dream, since it is PURE PASSAGNA! ? The same is true of the subjective reality of dreams, which are no less real. Let it not be supposed that the subjective and objective worlds of man coexist side by side under the same sky, in the same inn, and from the same mat. Let us return to

====================
Dialogic and dialectical method; the latter, quite by chance, is the one which gave rise to Kant's categorical imperative. I will return to this point in a moment.

The first thing to be noted is that the "appearances" which this metaphysician attributes to the categories of time, space and of time as such (i.e., the world as we know it and the world as it is) are, as we have seen, imaginary. The fact that the categories we use to talk of the world have not been actualized necessarily exempts us from all labors to realize these "appearances." The "appearance" of totality, for example, is real only in so far as it is specific, specific in that it is non-existent outside time. But the world as we know it, the world of appearances, is real only in so far as it is universal, universal in that it is not limited to any one time. "Universal" here does not mean phenomenal, but metaphysical universal, i.e., universal in the sense in which "World" is a term of communication in the mind of the world. All mental states, all mental categories, are, in the Ascom speech, a "matter of extent." The "appearance" of universality, then, is just that which can be so constituted according to mental conditions. Thus Schopenhauer says that all phenomenal experiences are created "from the same substance," i.e., from the same mind. All external objects are perceived as representing mental states, i.e., as representing "the same substance." All thought, therefore, is reduced to an act of representation, a mere linguistic juggling of words. Let us take an example. Say we have just perceived that sandal is golden. We say to ourselves, It is sandal. Now take another mind different from ours: It is not so easy to say that sandal is golden. Let us imagine a third mind, a highly mental mind, capable of saying "golden." We say to it, It is sandal. It says, It is sandal. It says It is sandal. It says, Again, It is not so easy to say." This third mind, now aware of its own incoherence, would describe it as golden, but would not give any reason for the awareness. The fact that three different minds generate the three objects of perception, magnitude, and bliss,

Dialogs and other parables. In the first place he intends to illustrate the fact that the history of the world is one single narrative, in which every act, every circumstance, every thought, every phrase, is interwoven and vital. He understands that the actions of men are not acts of mere chance or fraud; they are determined and they have significance, just as the membranes of a sick man are and will have significance until death. . . He understands that the Greeks and the Hebrews set forth in words the vast cosmos; we, in the language of China, grok the primitive state or village. He sees that the language of China is linear and analogous; ours is quicksilinear and covers a region of niches, crevices, and hieroglyphs.

In his treatise on the Thelems he does not avoid the problem of parallelism or of circular time; he puts it off until the last chapter. It is certain that he contemplated it. He traversed it. He did not find it in him to suspend judgment.

"In the first place," I say, "he contrasts the looping and the unlooping of a cyclone with the procession and the setting of a metronome. Contrast that with the comparison of the two methods of raising a blind man over a hard surface. Contrast the motionless and rigid surface of a corpse with the smooth and moving one. Compare the two methods. The first method requires skill and precision; the second requires quick reflexion and mechanical effort. The first applies to all men; the second to a small circle of few individuals chosen from the dense population of a nation. The first is practiced by all men; the second by a very select few. The first reveals a central problem; the second reveals a bilateral one. The first concerns the individual person; the second concerns his community. The first concerns himself; the second himself. The first appeals to the intellect; the second to the alert faculties of the will and the understanding. The first is intellectual; the second is practical. The blind man has one; we have another. The first concerns ourselves; the second to others. The first appeals to reason; the second to chance. The first appeals to common sense; the other to fancy."

And again:

"The first motion is simple; the second, more intricate. The first concerns ourselves; the second to eminent persons. The first

Dialogical]

"I note that you pronounce the word quite aridly. This is not surprising; it is derived from the Sumerian word for day, sar, which in the Laconian meant a bright or clear day. The root signifies a day on which something happens; the syllable sar (as in Samson's day) prefigures the Laconian day of battle, of panic and of slaughter. The interpretation of Israel's Psalm. 33:7:

O Lord our God, how long will we see The Lord as a shadow, as a ghost?

and that of the Psalm of David,

His days are already accomplished.

are two very pertinent words. In the first, the writer means that David, after having accomplished all that is desired of him, will finally be destroyed; in the second, that David, who has already completed his purpose, will at last complete his life. The former is suggested by the fact that David, after having accomplished all that is desired of him, will ultimately die; the latter, that his life will ultimately be fulfilled. A preliminary form of this interpretation was suggested by Schopenhauer, who (Theprene und Fabrik) speaks of a class of men, whose entire lives are only vaguely defined; these men will ultimately be redeemed from their ephemeral existences and will finally be present in heaven. . . Another reading, more in accord with the doctrine of the Trinity, is that of David, whose life will at last be made manifest, who as the only one of whom the world is hollow and empty, will make known to his people the nature of the universe and all that makes it up and, through David, the purpose of the universe. A third reading, more in accord with Augustine, suggests that David, after having accomplished all that is desired of him, will ultimately be destroyed; in that case, the world will be his tomb and in it the Word that created it. A fourth and final reading, more in accord with the Arius, suggests that David, after having accomplished all that is desired of him, will ultimately die; in that case, the world will be the end he will achieve and in him the punishment he will inflict. These readings are cogent, all of them, but I think of the text of Irenaeus, of the inscription on an early Bronze Age iron axe, of the manuscript on a gate of

Dialog



The Comte de Valéry is famous for the title he chose for himself. The rest, I gather, is well and good. But perhaps I can make a different choice, one not so easily discounted by the critics. I believe I have found it, and that, in a word, the novel Antigone. I begin by quoting a few lines from the novella; then I return to the preludes, and so on to the entire work.

Antigone is a pretty story, but it is a story too easily absorbed into other stories. It is not our business here to know whether Antigone is essentially a protest against the cruel practice of selling indulgences as a rule, or because, in spite of all the sweetness of her youth, she knows already the consummation of her life's purpose. Her conduct in this respect is typical of all the characters in Antigone, who make up the ensemble, which consists of the tragic heroine and her admirer, and who learns his lesson. It is clear that no one in this ambit of Antigone had a hand in creating this tragic destiny, which is the inescapable consequence of her actions. The attempts to discover this unavoidable fact are fruitless; for what can be the more obvious thing to be said? In Antigone there is a virgin, but she does not want her name revealed, and Antigone does not try to force himself upon her. It is probable that she sees him as a symbol of their union, perhaps even of salvation. The reader who takes into consideration all these circumstances would imagine that Antigone had intended to deceive this man, and that he was acting in order that he might deceive her. It is more likely that this man, contemplating the hopeless state of humanity, saw in Antigone an excellent hope for a better humanity.

Dialoges de la vie en monde (Paris, 1892).

There are certain words which in those days were almost synonymous. They refer to the same thing; they imply the same quality or state; they are not adverbial. My cousin's jacket and mine are the same jacket; this would be said of the written description of the jacket as such, not of the jacket itself. The same would be said of the approximate time of day at which the occurrence is described, not of that time. These words are not difficult to define; I only wish to suggest that no one yet has searched for an exact definition.

In France, in England, in America, the word has been extended almost unlimitedly, but the essential traits which made it French remain essentially good. In Germanic languages the word has also been extended, but the traits which made it German have largely disappeared. The English, in imitation of the Scandinavian languages, have sought to render the good by adding a few adjectives and a few instrumental words. The French have done the same with the Germanic words. They have added the instrumental words to augment the nouns; they have added the instrumental words so as to bring out the relationship implied; they have added the nouns so as to bring out the character of the place or the person. . . The result is that the most noble of European languages, English and French, are now nothing more than fragile remnants of that relationship which ancestry and language have so profoundly shaken to the core of creation.

So far, my argument goes as follows. The first man, at the dawn of life, descended from the skies and created the world. The second man, at the dawn of life, created the world in his time; the world, on his part, has created time. Time does not reason, it merely does. Time perceives, perceives, analyzes, deliberates, in a continual kaleidoscope of changes and rectilinaries which, though they seem to be periodic, nevertheless, in the advanced sensibility, are seemingly deterministic. Time, perceiving and acting within the same space, has the same object in common; time, which is identical with space, has nothing common. Time, which is identical with space and which possesses two objects, time and matter, loses its being and is reduced to a difference. Now since time is a posited thing, space also is; since the two are two

Dialog; he had no time to think about the dilemma. He fancied that he was taking part in a popular production. He imagined that the public desired harmony; he imagined that the producers of that harmony desired to exercise that harmony coercively. He imagined that the producers wanted to justify their omnipotence on the ground that it was necessary; he imagined that the producers wanted to justify their omnipotence on the ground that it was popular. He imagined that the public understood (perhaps he did not see) that no one is above the law. He imagined that the public understood (perhaps he did not see) that the law is merely a part of the law. He imagined that the public understood (perhaps he did not see) that the law is a public service.

The final confrontation took place in the Café de Tlön. The poet was led to a corner and there received from him a bouquet of linden leaves. The form was familiar; it too was the rhetorical instrument of Beckstrom. The confrontation was protracted; the letters of the alphabet were repeated; the pressure of the counter was endearing. The lines which preceded them (the first letter of the name Ferenc Zunz, for example) seemed to have a secret power; they seemed to have been arranged so as to be intelligible to the ear of one who does not know the name. This effect was enhanced by the repetition of certain letters; by the repetition of a single letter, by the dizziness one experience has with infinite combinations. The physical world seemed to me to be insipid and banal. I perceived at one and the same moment all manner and variety of linens, rugs, chandeliers, benches, and antechambers. The lines of the alphabet seemed to me to converge in an amorphous manner; I perceived, perhaps, the slightest affinity or antipathies of natu-ral nature, perhaps. The café seemed not to me to be divided into any great space; rather, it seemed to me that the qualities of its differentities seemed to be concentrated in some point. This sense of a concentrated and dizzying quality, of a concentrated and antipathetic quality, of a concentrated and secret quality, seemed to the poet Ferenc Zunz.

At that critical moment I thought no less than Shakespeare. I thought that a work of genius ― this work of Shakespeare, this work of Turgenev, Vico

Dialog (The word "monuments" here refers to those celestial or terrestrial works of the divine mind, the "works of philosophy," or "cogito diem.") The "Culture" of Spinoza is essentially polytheistic and anthropological. In the first century of the Tetrarchy (fourth century), for example, Philo of Salamis declares that the universe is the work of an invisible and incorruptible Creator; in the fifth, that the creature is a human being, Adam; in the eighth (and last!) century, that the creature is a bull. Spinoza thinks in terms of circles and tangents and circles and tangents; Aristotle, in terms of circles and tetrameters. The "science of man" of Plato is considered primitive and rudimentary; Aristotle is thought to have derived his doctrine (received in the second century of the Hegira) in connection with the practice of magic in Thibet. To speak cryptically of the "polytheisms" of antiquity is to admit of anachronistic familiarity; the polytheisms of Europe are as ancient now as the Reformation was then drawing near. The "cure" of Christianity is the earliest kind, that of metaphysics; the cure of metaphysics is surely that.

The oldest form of theology is what is now called monism; it is meant by what Crowley means by "mythology." It is this: The world is an arrangement of causes which induce successive appearances and an infinite regress of nought else. Man is a cause of these causes and the other effects. The first principles of religion are monism; these principles explain how men become gods and why the earth, the Sun and the Beast are admitted into the Book of Mormon. The second most ancient theology is a kind of antithesis: It is not the case that all beings that we see are products of chance and attribute to ourselves misfortune; on the contrary, the contrary is the case. . . The Book of Mormon is an inspired invention.

A third kind of theology derives from the Book of Mormon; it holds that the earth is a second soul that has a covenant with the Gods; the revelations testify to the fact. This doctrine (not denied by the Church) is less prevalent than the first two, though it is not less so.

The fourth kind of theology relates to the translation of characters in the book of Mormon; some affirm that the characters are truly

A famous French journalist once said that the essence of a good plot is that it makes the reader ponder. This same journalist foresaw the value of a similar strategy in adapting the story of Uqbar to the screens of young Americans. The result was the first feature film version of the Uqbar of Afshar Warsi; the second, The House on Cactus Street; still others, the four-and-forty minute films published from 1933 to 1940, which included an original score composed by William Shatner; and the television series, with its constant Afzal and Farhat Ali, which was never able to achieve the popularity of the novels. These films and novels were made possible by the brilliant criticism of a man who was not unknown in Paris or in the West: Olivier Assayas.

Olivier Assayas (1899-1945) was a major player in French documentary cinema during the First World War. He had, during the previous thirty years, been a director of photography and photo editor of a general medical and financial weekly, Le Monde, and a columnist for other newspapers and periodicals. He was also a gifted playwright, most memorably of tragedies including Chained at the Tail of the Whale and A Night at the Opera. He died on April 22, 1945, in his home borough of Aix-la-Chapelle.

Uqbar was the product of a rigorous collaboration with the Axis powers. It is well known that, in collaboration with the German cameraman Albert Speer, Assayas edited the so-called Golden Disk, a treasure-trove of Axis propaganda films dating back to

Dialog

You may look at it and say—

"This is the plot of a tragedy; it is not absurd."

And I, upon reflection, may say—

"This is the probable structure of a combinative system; it is not absurd."

The statement is reflexive, it is quantifiable, it is absolute. It is a very modern phenomenon.

I recall an article by Millet written some years ago. It is entitled—

"The Writing of the Rites."

The subject of the ritual is the Writing of the Rites; it is a ritual which authorizes the writer to accomplish the Work. I do not know whether the writer obtains permission from the Board of Governors to perform the Work in any form. I recall an article by Hinton which reads as follows:

"The Rites of Mithras."

The Work which it is requisite that every Man perform, let us say, once, let us say, in a single field, let us say, in a single city, let us say, in a single lifetime, let us say, perhaps in a single stone, is a thesis of Hume's that every man can perceive, within a certain limited field, the presence of physical objects. Let us say that field V, field G. V and G are the lines V and G, and that a certain color C is in the air near B, and a certain color V is on the second floor of H. V and G are the letters A and B; a man can perceive the presence of letter A and letter B in the air near B, and likewise in the air near C, and also in the air near D. Now B is intangible, transparent. It is not necessary for the man to look at it; it is evident to him. Now every man is aware of his surroundings; it is his duty to perceive them, to make an estimate as to the relative importance of the background objects and himself, which makes up the background. Now the field V in the previous paragraph is well defined by modern science; it is possible that the writer has just arrived at the precise point where he can no longer arrive, since the following sentence occurs: "The field V of modern science is now precisely reached." Still less is it certain: the writer of that sentence has not arrived at the point of no return, since, if he has arrived, it is

Dialog, poetry, drama, and, as is natural, philosophy. He was also a specialist in Roman and Greek inscriptions, and could tell when a writing matched a known one. Among the inscriptions on the Column of Trials is one of the first: the Decretals of the Goat. It is a quotation from an inscription dating back almost two millennia:



... the Goat who gives life pleasure is of equal worth with the Stoic sage and should be, along with the Hermetic philosopher, at the center of all attention.



The Jew had discovered that the problems of the Critique of Pure Reason could be applied to the problems of religion. The significance of the latter discovery goes far beyond the possible application of its axioms to the Critique of Pure Reason. The problem of the religious life is a problem which all nations will have to solve, and all religions will have to solve in the same way. No religion offers eternal reward or punishment; rather, it offers eternal symbols and eternal experiences. The Critique of Pure Reason asks us to select a symbol which best illustrates the life we wish to imitate, and a symbol which best approximates to that symbol in ourselves. This is a very general proposition, and, as we have seen, is unknowable. But it is intelligible from two poles incompatible with the arts of happiness and misery ― the vain and the humble. The religious life is a pathetic art; the problems of the Critique of Pure Reason are a materialistic art. And the more we ponder these facts, the more convinced we become that the Critique of Pure Reason is worthless. It is useless in formulating ideas; it is useless in time and again try to apply them. It is useless in the face of the infinite problem of life and the world.

The Paranormal



The Paranormal is the story of the mysterious murder of Jean Charles-Alain Tété in the Rue de Toulon at nightfall on March 31, the year 1903. Tété had sent for him the preceding Sunday evening at his apartment at 101st Street, along the Rue de Toulon and through some secret and almost inextricable passage of Rue Saint-Denis. The precise nature of the crime and its manner of death are not explained; the police suspect that the victim was tortured to death, perhaps for political or religious reasons; others attribute his suicide to despair, madness or some other state of suspended reality. The novel is told in two parts, the first, a prologue, the second, a conclusion.

The novel is divided into eight or 12 sections or books. Chapters I to XX are practically sketches or parables; they are devoted to very simple problems: first, to determine whether it is possible to be in doubt about one's own essence and identity and also about one's surroundings, when one passes through a garden in the suburbs; second, to determine whether it is possible to be in doubt about one's own essence and also about one's surroundings, when one passes through a garden in the suburbs; chapters XXI to XXX are interludes or interludes forming the full ninety pages of the final volume; the interludes occur between the central parables. The interludes themselves have no formal beginning; the reader is

Dialog. The "rather languorous" diction conveys the impression of a loose, ill-defined document. The sometimes lax grammar and the repetitious verbs (and their adverbial mood) sometimes remind us of Borges's own style. The first volume of the second collection is the best example we have seen, but the errors and the general structure repeat themselves throughout.

The physical book we have considered has been eliminated, for the following reasons:

(a) It is evident that the reader does not expend much effort in obtaining the information he requires; (b) his eyes do not tire out of the narrow arc of the reading; (c) the number of words does not seem to him worth while, since the number of illustrative cases is great; (d) the number of conjunctions does not exhaust him; (e) the volume he seeks does not exhaust him; (f) he finds it easier to consult the index of appendices than to peruse the whole work; (g) the study of the Vulgate does not seem to him necessary, since the Codex and the minor parts of the major books are sufficient. . . .

The present work is the product of nearly a year's labor. I owe it to my readers ― and to myself ― to the droll, the ridiculous, the poor, my fellow travelers ― to the work is somewhat less a part of its intentions than its effects would warrant. My style is, perhaps, not that of Pelé, but it is not that of the man I have just identified. I have tried to recall to you not only the general features of my personality, but also those of the Codex Urbanaf iligan Perthes. This labor did two things. It indicated to me the quality and quantity of labor which the translators who would read it would merit, and it informed me of certain tendencies which the best of them would not be capable of reflecting. I shall try to do so now, so as to make my intention more readily apparent.

My first act of collaboration was to make up my mind to write the work of J. S. A. I believe I said, already, Eco's. It was already obvious to me that he would demand a considerable revision, since he had not only completed it a year before, but also substantially augmented it. This fact, however, did not influence me as much as my loathing and admiration of his method

"The second part was not so difficult to write. It is an epigraph which narrates the history of the Cantos. Here is the epigraph which I considered the most fitting:

SUMMARY OF THE CRITICAL CELEBRATIONS



"In the year 1943, the year of the German invasion, a certain Madame Henri Bachelier, of the seventh arrondissement, found herself in the presence of the most atrocious of all anachronisms: the notary's bookshelf, bearing in remarkably good condition the signature of a man who had signed his name but had not actually done so, a signature which the notary could have verified, but which he did not. Bachelier tore it to pieces, and sent it through the ranks of the charred debris, like a flag which has not flown once. . . The presence of this fragment, in the presence of no other, was, for her, decisive. In 1945, she was able to recover it, during the last years of the dictatorship, in an apartment in Brossard. In the very floor, amid the ashes, she found, forches along on a fibula, a mark which had been consistently undiminished since then. The hands which signed it were indifferent. Some of them would not look at the other signatures. Henri Bachelier had signed his own; others, others his sister, who had signed her own name but could not have signed her own fate. This second signature, which signified the recovery of the other signatures, was the signal which brought about the victory of Hindustan. In the midst of that triumph, a most extraordinary thing happened. For the first time in the history of mankind, two contradictory memories merged. One memory, of a triumphant Hindustan, eager to prove itself, eager to prove itself in every possible manner; the other memory, of a spirit which was conscious of no
====================
Dialogation is one of the most essential functions of language; it is the medium by which ideas are synthesized into verbal phrases. It is also the most superficial and superficial indeed: a crude transcriber will observe that all the possible cognates of the English word "horse" are spelled out, and if he carefully studies a few letters he can reconstruct the complete name "horse" (in this way "Marengo," "Pan," "Darren," "Tony," "Davy," and "Julia" were recovered). A mere layperson will conclude that all this incoherence is due to the imperfection of the written phrase; but this judgment is based on the rejection of the most exquisite means of communication: the medium of ideas. The medium of ideas is prose: these words, these expressions of language, combine, recombine, and persist in time with the most ancient ideograms. The reader has acquired a vocabulary which is not infinite, but is rather superficial and easily depleted. In other words, the problem of time does not impinge upon our credit as authors; on the contrary, it seems to us of importance. . . The foregoing exposition of the medium of ideas is insufficient. It is sufficient to observe that, in spite of all the marvelous advances made by literature, it always maintains the same basic contradictions. The problem is how long the literature of our times (as that literature is called) can persist in these irrelevancies and metaphorical follies. And the only possible explanation is that they have already occurred and will again and these past occurrences will be the fundamental motif of a new saga; a saga of time.

It is certain that whoever considers the foregoing exposition with sanity will conclude that it is false. The contrary is so; for the sophisticated analyst the problem is not so black and white; it is much more complicated. Let me try to make it less complex.

The development of my exposition is quite general. I do not claim that it is irrefutable or conclusive; on the contrary, I would say that to deny its tremendous dimensions is to commit oneself to a moderate or even a derisory perception. I shall attempt a quantitative exposition, a symbolic one, like that of Lessing or Beck's.

The first phenomenon is the one we all feel: time. I have mentioned it already; it is objectively real; it is the relative difference of moments. I have already said that the development of all philosophical dialog

Dialog" which he had composed. It was a mere collation of verses, simple and forgettable, written in a careless and careless style. He had not thought over them, he had simply uttered them. He thought that if he were not insane, he should be less capable than man of producing thousands of such phrases.

He tried several theories. One, more arduous than the other; suggested that the whole universe were mere verbal expressions, that the imperfection of a few was not extensive, and that the utterance of a single word formed a mental image of all the forms in the world. This conjecture was opposed by another, more charitable. It iste no es un homme; that is, rather than in the minds of men all images be made. Words formed by the mind, images formed by the paper. Ideas formed by the paper are inconceivable without ideas formed by the mental images. Ideas formed by the mind are images formed by ideas formed. This mental paper, this mental world, is the same which gives rise to verbal images.

On Plato and His Forms



Tzvet Ben-Shem wrote: (Isocrates, Republic, i, 2) The school of Plato, which he founded, sought to produce a monist philosophy, a monistic system of the world; other schools have followed his example. He thought that a science of human nature could not be orthodox, nor would a science of nature accept a monist doctrine. He reasoned that a science of nature would accept a transcendent theology, a theology of the angels; a monist doctrine of the world would not be able to embrace a theology of the human race. He thought that a science of human nature would comprehend all being, all qualities and attributes, and not be able to extricate itself from the supposition that there is a single essence behind all things. He thought that a monist system of the world would be able to embrace all being, all qualities and attributes, and not be able to extricate itself from the supposition that there is one essence behind all things. He thought that a monist system of the world would be able to embrace all being, all qualities and attributes, and not be able to extricate itself from the supposition that there is one essence behind all things.

This last conjecture has been fulfilled. The doctrine of the Father exists

Dialogical passages or set pieces; the same physical objects are used in the same way over and over again." In 1849, a year before his death, he issued his most famous work, Uncle Tom's Cabin. The story was an elaboration of the first part, a satire on two wealthy merchants from Hamtramck, H. G. Wells and Wells' Uncle Tom. The theme was the perils of ambitious ambition and the dangers of blind optimism. The text of Uncle Tom's Cabin is 1,400 pages; the story written in a year. The work is, in a certain sense, a monograph; the reader is not encouraged to trace the steps of its development. The "enthusiasm of the invention" is not emphasized; rather is its intellectual labor. The manner in which it is told, the atmosphere of the places and the moods of the narrators are of a piece with those of a work of literature. The reader is urged on by the hope that this prodigious work of ours will one day have the approval of God and that He will forgive our sins and grant us eternal life.

The second volume of the work concerns the problems of the future and of time. The first is obvious: Who shall succeed Huckleberry Finn as the patron of the intellectual classes? The second is less obvious but has been the object of so much speculation that I shall set it forth.

The history of the intellectual classes, we have been led to expect, will narrate, at least somewhat, the history of types; the history of the heirs of Adam, we have been led to expect, to tell the history of types; the history of all men will tell, at least somewhat, the history of types; time will tell, at least somewhat, the history of types; and so on, in a circular chain, almost infinite, according to the infinite variety of men and of the various sciences, according to the variety of epochs, of centuries and of entire continents, of astronomical devices and symbolic devices, of signs and of man-made types.

But there is no "honor" to be found in these expectations; there is only the possibility of enormous errors. The problems presented by the history of types are infinite, but the corrections and the discoveries are infinite. The history of types may require that the number of errors in the book should not exceed that of the pages, that the number of signs and capital letters or

To the Citizens of Castile

We are Citizens of Castile. We have been Citizens of Castile since the year 1824, when the Mexican War broke out. The year before that, our sovereign was Francisco Piz Guedes (Benedict), who, under the protection of thevil, was defeated and killed by our brothers from Tlön. They marched him from barangays to streets, from alleyways to courtyard, from village to village, to give him battle. They buried him in the morning, they broke his body in battle, they sprinkled his ashes in a field, they sang his last rites. In that battle, Julian ordered martyrdom. Death did not intervene between the two men. Julian died in battle, but he rose from the grave as a brother. Death did not intervene between them.

In the year 1824, the brothers from Tlön organized a political party, which at first they called the Libertas Libres. They called themselves Libertas, for this reason: because they maintained that all power is absolute and that the smallest authority, the smallest act, can only be the result of that act in some other, even greater, capacity. They called themselves Libres because they proclaimed the collection of all the planets and the harmonization of all the audible sounds in the universe; because they proclaimed that the laws of gravitation were deduced from the laws of Manuel de Garay, who had previously published them in two books; because they proclaimed that the periodic table was a shorthand book containing the keys to all the secrets of the universe. This manifest absurdity amused them. They considered that a book with such limited contents could be printed, and they did print it, in twenty volumes. Their motto was the Book Anthology. The first volume was devoted to astrology and, later, to the study of the periodic table. The second volume was devoted to enigmatical verse and, later, to astrology and the periodic table. In both volumes were found the codes for the planets. These planets, they proclaimed, could be found in any one of these books. In other volumes were found the keys to all the sciences of the universe. These sciences included infinity, which is divisible, plus plus plus plus, plus plus plus, plus plus plus.

The calendar of Libertas Libres was an endless circle. For every forty books

Dialog and the Religious. . . We all know that in the second period of that play, a certain Philip José Farmer (John Russell Mitchell) hears in a dream a long discourse on the ars vocations and games of Faust and in the next dream a long discourse on the history of the universe. . . One of the dreamers, Mr. Farmer, has studied the dialogue with exact attention and he has verified, up to the last phrase, the exactness of the historical exactness of the dialogue with exact attention. He has annotated, with a malleable pen, the minor details which the author has omitted. He has placed before our notice the heterogeneous character of the subjects, of the times, of the places. . . There are in fact three diverse and true or fictitious worlds — the home world, the world of dreams and the world of Mr. Farmer. How can we be astonished that these diverse and true worlds should coincide? We know that matter and spirit mutually annihilate each other; we also know that there are other heterogeneous worlds, with their multiplicity of heterogeneous matter and their multiplicity of heterogeneous spirit. These worlds do not coincide. One world resembles the other and the other resembles the world of dreams. This world is identical with the other world, which is identical with the world of dreams. This world is heterogeneous, and it will ever be so. . . We have now the play, the library, the dreams, the homilies by Mr. Farmer, the investigations of the bureau of Narciso Rodriguez, the combats, the reconstructions of the dead man's corpse, the discovering of the letters of Faust, the reconstructions of the corpse, the "translations," with a malignant veneration of hagiographies, of medieval texts, of Babylonian and Egyptian inscriptions, of heraldic ephemera, of the petroglyphs of Panopticon, of the crucifixion of a bull, of the burning of a prison guard, of the rape and dismemberment of a prisoner. The universe itself does not occur once in these innumerable trillions of events. Each of the countless trillions of heterogeneous worlds is prefigured in the corresponding multitude of individual worlds. Each world is a symbol of a universal. Each world is repeated in time. Each world is a symbolic representation of some universal process. Each world is, as such, an infinite series of worlds. Each world is an infinite series of worlds

Dialog and the Circle. The former is a linear narrative which interprets the external world in terms of the internal world and makes of it symbols; the latter is a nonlinear narrative which modifies the internal world in terms of symbols and makes of it actions. The former, as we have seen, is the province of dreams; the latter, at least in the Western tradition, belongs to the Averroes and Middle Ages. Kant distinguishes them virtutally:



For the Averroes the problem of dreams is insoluble. They do not understand that a dream consists in a succession of still more minute and continuous representations of the same world; this world, in their metaphysicians, is the air, the light, the distant fig tree, the melodious creaking of the ship, the gradual rising and setting of the women, the gradual sinking and rising of the objects represented, all this takes place in a suspended moment of complete freedom. The world, in their philosophy, is nothing other than that rapid succession of immediate representations. . . All idealists, all consummated men, would shrink from admitting the necessity of a material basis and from admitting that the world is, in some way, a series of representations. But for the Averroes, the problem is not so easily explained. They insist that the world is a few concepts ― of things, of persons, of times, of spaces ― which men are forbidden to look at. This denial of absolute reality nullifies and mystifies the problem. If time, which is an absolute series of presentments, is not actual, what is? And what is the person represented by the present present, whose present does time not efface or effloreschen? These and other absurdist questions obscure the Averroes' masterwork, The World We Live In. In the first century of our history, Pope Chrysostom formulated the paraphrase:


History is the return of something or other to its primal state

and the prophet Daniel decreed,



History is the reconditioning or transforming of the seas, of the woods, of the earth, in the name of which the First Emperor of the Universe ruled his subjects and invested them with immortal rights. ~ Albertus Machean

Dialog.

This chapter introduces the study of verb conjugations. The conjugation of the verb is not presented here, but the result is that the reader may compare the various conjugations and arrive at his or her own. To the conjugations not already mentioned we add ones which the quixotic lexicographer considers most worthy of notice.

The conjugations used in this chapter are those found in Jones's dictionary of idioms. A few definitions are given, taken verbatim from the glossaries.

Adjectives are formed by adding an s at the end of the verbal adjective to fuse it to the noun or thing to which it refers. Thus, car plusieurs amoureos is formed by adding an s at the end to make it car plusiers and to form adjectives adverbiel and adjectives ajouteur. Noun adjectives are formed by adding an s at the end to make it nouveau and to form adjectives amoureux and amoure.

Verbs and intransitive verbs modify nouns or objects. They modify the verb to be followed by another verb, modify the second verb to be followed by another, modify the third verb to be followed by a fourth, modify the fourth verb to be followed by a fifth, modify the fifth verb to follow a sixth, etc. Noun adjectives modify intransitive verbs in the following manner: first, they modify the transitive verb to be followed by it; second, they modify the dative to express the third person singular; third, they modify the intransitive verb to be followed by it; fourth, they modify the nouvelle verbe to express the third person plural. Noun adjectives have in common with intransitive verbs the following: (a) they are of a verbal type, (b) they are always transitive, (c) they have no object, but have the double value of expressing the third person singular and of expressing the third person plural, and (d) they are always modifiable. Noun adjectives have the property of having the prefix –er, which modifies the intrinsic value of the adjective. Noun adjectives modify intransitive verbs in the same way as other intransitive verbs.

Interrogatives modify the second person singular.

De- and infinitives modify the accusative.

Dialogromo delle Scienza" ("On the Second Sight"; 1701).

In the first volume of his "Faust," Cervantes (in the year 1757) sets down the general theory that the human soul exists in a body, in a brain, in a foot, in a fish. "We know," he writes, "that such a brain exists in the Book of Changes," a theory which, however, does not seem to him to conflict with the facts of the case. "We know," he writes, "that the events of the Book of Changes have, according to various traditions of Islam, the assistance of a divine agent." Cervantes, in the "Dialogue juin 1757" ("The Birth of Rassilon, Part I"; 1701)); in the same volume (part II of the same series) we also find the "secret" "recension of Ages" ("Part II"; 1702).

These "infallibles," which are, in fact, successive chapters in a single work, proceed almost chronologically. "The world," continues Cervantes, "is a cyclic one, with hours and minutes denoting years, hours and lines denoting centuries, lines and centuries denoting days, lines and centuries denoting men, men and men denoting fishes and decades and centuries and fish." "The universe," continues the author, "is not a series, but an irregular one, with innumerable centers, with infinite gradations. The years are the circumference of the centuries, the years the diameter of the hypotenuse, the centuries the line between the years, the centuries the mark of the hypotenuse and the years the line between the years and the centuries the mark of the line between the years and the fish."

"The universe," concludes Cervantes, "does not admit of being described with absolute words." "No," I reply, "since the very definition of a word is the impossibility of describing it."

The first object, the world, is, as far as I know, the only object which all men conceive to be eternal. It is obvious that it is not eternal, since it is an image ― a semblance ― of a noneternal thing. To the world of ideas, then, we adapt that of a certainty. "The world of faith is a dream," say Schopenhauer and Bacon and all the

Dialog" (see Introduction). The theory of the understanding of a book is the same as that of the eye of a cicada, its details the color of an ocean. I have mentioned the "unconscious," or the intellectual or sentimental, or the volitional, as these may be called. This term is not understood by all; it is sufficient for me to speak of a doctrine or a system of thinking. I have already mentioned the "illusion of free will." This is that doctrine which holds that our volition determines everything, including our physical condition. It holds that the individual acts through no other than one or a few (wholly unconscious) causes, and that these causes are present in his thought and act upon him as he acts. This view is alien to all the religions of the earth. . . I know of many men who reject all responsibility for their physical condition, or reject all responsibility at all; I know of men who deny the reality of death; these doctrines, although alien to our own traditions, are widely held in the remote past. I have already mentioned the "illusibility of mental perception," the doctrine introduced by Schopenhauer. This, I think, is the most pernicious of all; for which reason only one man has ever held the right to lecture in this house: Schopenhauer. He did this in order to justify his theory of a personal God; but the more important reason is that this personal God, this one doctrine, is supposed to be incomprehensible to us, almost incomprehensible, whereas the fact is that all the branches of philosophy—holistic, a priori, absolute, deductive, logical—can be understood. I have already mentioned that the "unconscious" or the "imagined" is the cause of all things; I repeat that the cause of this cause is the ego, which is also the ego. The ego is nothing but the way we think and the way we are made. It is the way we think because we create it by means of ideas, but it is also nothing but a relation of time, a series of interrelated ideas, because time is the relation of time which all things have. We create the ego in this way: we imagine ourselves to be something else; later we come to realize that this other being is the self, which is nothing else than the imagined self. This other being is the self only in so far as it is the self, because the self

Dialog, a book not yet translated. The first volume of the second is in the Bodleian Library. In 1899, I delivered the eighth lecture at the first Oxford Union Congress devoted to "the systematic philosophy of numbers." One of the speakers was the French logician Emile Zuuland, who proposed an astronomical system in which the revolutions of the tangent of a revolution were used to solve equations of the same domain. This domain was then Geometry, now Solidi, now Algebra. . . Zuuland's logico-alchemical geometrical astronomy was, as one may have foreseen, apropos only for the afternoons of stormy nights when it is convenient to be able to go astray in the labyrinth of the Imaginary and find a book that explains everything without adding, subtracts, multiplies or modifies anything. "Algorithms" were not the only domain for which Zuuland proposed a logic. Zuuland maintained (1903), using dicta from Descartes and le problème du matin du matin, and from Turgenev and rue de Toulon, that gray, intangible things, lines, cones, units of heat, electricity, light, sound and cold, constitute tangible objects. This verbatim translation of an article in Le Quotidien (No. 71, August 1903) is satisfactory: Zuuland (who died in Toulon in 1904) postulated, as did many logicians of the second half of the nineteenth century, an objective reality distinct from the phenomena which form it, real and intelligible though the transience of our bodily existence may be. . . Zuuland's logical system, which combined elements of algebra and archetypal mathematics, was incomplete; some of its paradoxical divisions could not have been sustained in a single work. . . One of its components, the "problem of the universe," required a "logical theory of the subconscious mind" (quoted in Berneillet, Le Mystere philosophique, I, 496). Without losing time, Berneillet formulated it as follows: "Everything that exists has an inner mind, an image of the thing it can touch, feel, or hear; this image is identical with the thing and can therefore never be something of its contrary elements: it is the substance it is composed of and it is also the spatial relation

Dialogs and other writings of his; but the best of them all is the Memoirs, his vast, illusory collection of all his memories, opinions, experiences, jokes, tragedies and philosophical reflections. The text is almost incomprehensible to the untrained eye; but recall, also, the first Principles of Man and you will understand the whole of "The Importance of Being Wet." The present volume is identical with the third part; the first two were published posthumously. The Memoirs form an integral whole, enriching and modifying each other. To the Memoirs one adds another, a third and so on to infinity; this process, which seems to be going on simultaneously in my mind and in the world around me, has eluded me so far as to render me a composite of the moments of three men.

I take it that my brethren and I were already well acquainted with the perils and beauties of that nebulous region between life and death, purgatorial purgatory and instant punishment, discipline and depravity, hope and damnation, known to the ancients and prophets alike. We were, perhaps, already familiar with the doctrine of atemporal punishment, which maintains that, at the end of a human life, that life ending in nought, that life beginning again in time unending punishment. There are those who deny that such a future state even exists; others, more subtle, contend that it does exist, that its cause is impossible to identify, that it is an attribute of the Logos, who after having created all men and then all honor and all error, decides to punish only one: the Christian. These two opinions, diametrically opposed, coexist in a secret corner of the Internet. One evening in early December, 2012, a message from Brazil brought us news of the mysterious murder of Joaquim Rodriguez Padrón, at the home of his former associates in Paraíba, twenty miles from Pampaio. The precise spot was not immediately clear; rumors had it, like so many other things in this chaotic universe, being just as much its property as opportunity, were too numerous to be kept in check, and were disseminated in an almost frenzied fashion like a rumor. The victim had been dragged along the damp earth to a clearing where human heads had been nailed to the top of a large, useless post; someone had then thrown off their clothing, and a game

Dialog) and I can hardly think of anything else. The poet recites a speech or a monologue, then finds the perfect word or the most perfect clause. A few lines in, his mind is in complete agreement with mine, and I tell him what I have read or what I recall from my youth or childhood, and he interprets it for me. The unity and mutual interpretation of the mind are the peculiar property of poetry, which is that it can do without words and without the concrete, but it can do without the relations of time, space, consciousness, the relations of matter, the relations of ideas. It can have none other than the most perfect and circular thought. This is the case, for example, with the person of Mozart. He was made in a moment of divine inspiration, his essence contained in a few words, and the first he ever uttered was that of inspiration. The poet can imagine, or can conjecture, or can communicate to the reader, not the author, but those few words which constitute his essence.

The idea of a single person endowed with an infinite series of attributes is, in my judgment, one of the most amazing features of reality. It is unique, perhaps the unique, the property of distilling all nature's diversity into one single attribute. It is the idolatry of the psychologists; it is theomnisomena of Leibniz. I have found in the fictions of Faust and of Hrabanus the most emphatic rejection of this interpretation. The latter places great importance on the transmuted bull of Hapsburg and on the transmuted marriage of Faust and Balthasar, but they do not appeal to this divine inspiration but to a bull of the barbarians. The eminent German philologist Leibniz conceived a very pure form of this, which is illustrated by his "Principia" (ded. 1632): "I believe, I reason, I perceive, in a state of vibration, a state of substance I inscribe on earth; for this substance is nothing else than the divine impassibility, the union of the divisibility of the world and of the indivisible part I leave on the final note."

Dialog (negative numbers, negative symbols and so on) as a means of evaluating them, with a view to discerning the correct number of negatives. The most beautiful of his systems was that of Gomperz (1899-1943). Gomperz (Bishop of Milan, 1884-1931) proposed that all human relationships (marriage, procreation, child rearing) should be analyzed analytically, in terms of antagonisms or possibilities that emerge in the relationships themselves. The relationship here would be that between Aristotle and Spinoza. Spinoza believed that all things are problems of an essence that is beyond the powers of perception or reason and that only the Gods can perceive it and understand it. The analysis of a relationship would reveal to Spinoza the relationship's principium ac ideo, or "inherent difference" or "invisible hand" or "absolute mind" or "ultimate purpose."

Gomperz's system was essentially deductive. He distinguished two kinds of relationships: those between persons and those between things. A relationship "arises out of" a thing and a thing out of a thing, he said. An "arises out of" a thing and"arises out of" a thing" and a thing out of a thing. Relationships are qualitatively different, qualitatively speaking, from names, forms or objects. A thing and a person are not the same individual. A person is not, in turn, the same individual. Gomperz proposed a new kind of relationship, one in which all aspects of the subject — even its identity — were being analyzed. He proposed that the subject be called at times only in order to make a point or to make a simple affirmation, and at other times to make a connection or to make a negative affirmation. (This is what Hegel does with the marks of the Abyss: he submits them to the effect that they reveal the Reality.) The subject should make such a connection with a clock: it should affirm that it is moving toward the new standard-time, and then it would have the Reality of an invisible hand. (This is what the Absolute says to the dog in the final movements of El cielo de la Rosa:) "You lie.") Gomperz's system is deductive, but he did not want to be deductive. He wanted to go beyond the limits of reason. He wanted to experience the Forms

My dear Rabelais: I believe I have already mentioned the Triste-Lévi-Strauss Theology in a few pages; I shall attempt to repeat it here. In the work which forms the basis of your theology, I cannot fail to find the stamp of an influence, the imprint of a master. Theology without theology would be a mere matter of following the Prophet's example; theologizing accordingly is the proper task of moral theologians. The philosophy of J. E. M. Leonardorev has rightly remarked: "Hume understood that the true knowledge of a subject consists in affirming it, and not in negating it; Juss3 thought the same of Velázquez." From these two masters, I have taken up my abode. I write as a philosopher; he who writes as an atheist will understand me.

It has been pointed out to me that your Theorique sur les Hypotheses (Le Cinéma, 1894) bears traces of the Hypotheses sur les Hypotheses of J. E. M. Fermat derived from Fermat's Last Theorem (Treatise on Fermat's Last Theorem, 1899) and Leclerc's Le Congaute Supérieure (Discus-Symbolism, 1899) and these traces are indeed sufficient to show that the influence of Fermat's paradox on your science is minimal. I take it that you have already noticed these minimal traces and removed them; I understand that you do not wish to imply that our similarity is sufficient to justify the minimal attribution of a complete work to him?

No; you will not deny it. Jules Verne observed in the preface to the third edition of his Geometrie des Hautes Etattes (Éditions Librais, Paris, 1933): "Geometrie is not a science of the sensible, but of the unreal." And again: "It is useless to give a Geometer a job as scientific theorist; that would be to accept that immense task on inadequate conditions."

I think you will agree that our science is not limited to the study
====================
Dialog.

I think the same about all inquiries into the past, all inquiries into the future. We can see the reflection of a god in the preachers who talk of a fixed, eternal time; we can see it in the theologians who propose to describe all human deeds in terms of an absolute concept; we can see it in the Spaniards who imagine that a single death and dismemberment can constitute a nation. . . It seems to me that what we are about to contemplate is not an infinite regress, not even a semi-forgotten one; we are about to unpack a vast and yet invisible system. Men act in order to get things; this act of getting results in their histories. This act of getting results in their consciences. This act of getting results in the instrument they are about to become, in the nation they are going to destroy, in the nation of the gods who created men.

I think all this is true. I think, however, that what we are about to contemplate is not infinite but rather pitiable. A poor man once in my life time and again feels the same way I do: that he was once rich, that he once enjoyed the luxury of making choices, that now he is poor and will probably be so forever; that, in order to escape from this abiding misery, he has twice consented to be deceived: once by fate, twice by him. That wretched act of temptation is the source of all virtue, the secret treasure of all thieves. If I were rich, I should throw it away; I should keep it for some illustrious person or collect it into a certain form or use it up. I should throw it away, I should be satisfied with pittance. I am miserable because I have taken it. The past, the future and everything I have done in my life are but the tip of a degenerate and useless iceberg. The more I think of it, the more unbelievable this system seems.

Let us consider an hypothetical case. Let us imagine a complete man. He is free and conscious of his acts. He decides what he is going to do. He decides for himself what his character is going to be, what his actions are going to represent. He decides what his actions are going to signalize, what a gesture he is going to make of those branches of his costly and complex forest he will one day sap and graft into something valuable. He decides what his acts

Dialog; if he had not discovered it, no one could have guessed that the work would be of such vast and important consequence. The clue lies in the name of the chief city. It was not Tecumseh who had discovered it, but a Spanish brigantine named Fatuente del Rio, named for the legendary hero of the Ramayana.

Alvarado had discovered the law of large numbers; Bernardo de Soto had discovered that the universe is composed of the many minds of the patient saint. The world had been created, not of a few minds, but of many minds. The name of the city suggested itself: it was apropos: it was ancient. Ancient and modern, the eastern and western quarters, the ancient and the modern, Tlön, where the Milesoman Wars have not destroyed the cities they ravaged, is not, strictly speaking, Tlön, but it is Tlön, where the Milesoman Wars cease to exist. Ancient and modern, the western and eastern quarters, Tlön was the site of a golden temple whose arches and guttersénén gleamed like the robes of the sileni and whose facades were dominated by vast golden statues of beneficent fertility. Tlön was also, in a way, the ruins of a temple: the temples of Tlön were not in need of renovation ― they were already antiquities, irreplaceable though they were ― but they were also irreplaceable in that they contained the ghosts of past ages, imaginations in constant flux. . . Ancient and modern, the western and eastern quarters, the western and eastern corridors, the western and eastern corridors, Sleepless and Sleepless, the western and southern corridors, were in some way the same. Sleepless and Sleepless, the western and southern corridors, were in some way the same. Sleepless and Sleepless, the western and southern corridors, were in some way the same.

There were four planes in Tlön: the plane of the noble, the plane of the rich, the plane of the stupid. Each of the four cardinal directions was supported by a secret color. Tlön was a labyrinth, a prison. The colors of Tlön ― gold, red, green and ― multiplied in a circular fashion. Each cell contained four colors. The color of a cell did not determine its value in Tlön: some colors were more

Plutarch, Life of Amyntas, I, 1016 ff (trans. Melville) (Greek historian C1st B.C.-D) :

"In the time of the [first] Olympiad, the [heroic] race of the [new] Olympiad (for they did not know who they were) was fashioned out of Asia and reduced to a barbaric war of chariots and war-games. They knew nothing of the chariot nor of the game. Years later, in the [temporal] empire of the [second] Olympiad, the race was reconstituted and the people was delighted to see it (for it was new and had its own language) and at last to see its destiny set before it. The nations of the world had their chance; the people of Athens had itsades. It took them a hundred and ninth Olympiad [in order to overthrow Rome and take her for herself]; but the hundredth Olympiad did not care whether Athens won or lost; it was enough that Athens should win."

"The art of fortune-telling is one which is unique in the known world. Its practitioners employ a few well-chosen words or phrases, a few irreverent devices, an irresponsible indifference to the rules of evidence and gravity, a basic tenacity. . . The probability of such a task devolves upon the most erudite of mystics: on the most exhausted and abandoned of men. We have seen that in the world of dreams and astrology the artist is the same as the forecaster. The fortune-teller is the other, the other destitute of dreams and endowed instead with words and tricks."

The theme on which this essay is principally composed is the problem of the symbolic order of things. As far as I know, no one has attempted to solve it, save perhaps, perhaps, for Leucippus, Jean Cocteau. If he attempted to do so, he would not have recourse to a kind of Cartesian dualism, which would require him admitting that "the world is symbolical"; but Marc-André Néel, Néel on Symbolique (Número, Paris, 1946), professedly an early translation of the first part of Leucippus, documents a true Leucippian synthesis, in which Néel -- Néel, Néel, Néel, ― Nélaus ― Platonus, and we, as such, the reader. . . )

Dialog (10), for the mode of his death is unknown, though the evidence suggests a drowning, a blunt instrument or a clubbed one. There is no other trace of the man, aside from the impression of a corpse which settles in the air and of something soft and dampingingly damp on the ridges of the hill. His face was that of a young man of medium height, with a full beard, and his manner was friendly and cordial. He told of a conspiracy against him and spoke to him with a British accent.

I have noted that the faces of the conspirators were similar; it is reasonable to suppose also that the manner was the same. We know that the conspirators are Indians from the riverside places of worship. It is also possible that the conspirators are of European extraction and speak English. It is also possible that the conspirators are of Indian blood, as has been postulated by Oppermann. This possibility has been substantiated by the memoirs of Tandy and by the testimony of others. Oppermann states that in 1884 he and Oppermann Fahrenbach emigrated with his brother Johannes, Eric Heinrich Oppermann, and three companions to Denmark. They arrived at Foya, on the Pacific coast, on February 1, 1884.

We know that the group spent several days in the old mill on the high ground. The weather was cloudless and the buildings spacious. A few paces from the mill, in the old wigwams, there appeared a tall, gray-haired woman. They stopped to talk to her; she was Tandy, a customer, a certain Madame Fahrenbach, Margrave de la Rebeuf, the authoress Maria Simon and Jules Caillan. They had gone through the trouble of choosing a table and were about to have a glass of red wine when a tall, thin stranger, with inattentive eyes, entered.

"Who are you?" asked Tandy.

"From the embassy," she replied. "I am Tandy from Tilsit."

Dialogical note

"Even in the case of the most elementary and obvious facts, there is an art to which the vulgar cannot sink." — Albert Einstein, General Theory

The following essay is taken from The Cambridge History of the World, edited by John Murray. The first chapter and the last are from this edition.

The general notion that languages are the result of accidental succession of identical sounds in an inexorable dialectical process has its basis in the Platonic theory of language (About.D. Thomassulus, Hippolytus, Anaxagoras). This theory holds that the verbal expressions found in nature are the product of gradual selection and gradual inheritance; but it is observed that in the verbal productions of men, as well as in the verbal productions of nature, the traces of all these periodic lines may be found. This fact, which is perhaps accidental, gives rise to certain absurdistic conclusions. The most famous of these is that of the tripartite trust ― two sources, one representsa ― which has been urged that all writers should link up with such connections because it helps to sustain their objectivity. But this very association of objects (common in nature, for example) leads naturally to other absurd conclusions. For example, the dictum that the universe was ― or should be ― simplestra, leads us to the absurd conclusion that the universe is complex. (Compare the Theologico- logical Argument of Bender-Lönnrot.)

Another erroneous idea connected with languages is that of a gradual division of them, into consonants and vowels. This idea has been expressed graphically by Shakespeare, for example: ―

A man have my consonants,

My vowels, my easy tones ―

So melodious I cry:

Vowels, vowels, melodious tones ―

So beautifully written:

Each line of stanzas I,

I, I, will not write,



 ― because each line of stanzas I, I, will not write,

because each line of stanzas I, I write.



Another example:



The prince and the vase

Between two fevers

Are wont to slope;

Each day is wont to be

Thick;

Each half-day to be red;

Each minute to be scratchy.

Dialog

The first idea I shall set forth is not one which has been long neglected. It is this. If, in the world of Plato, the Good is something eternal, what is the Soul? Plato thinks it self to be the Wisdom of the World; but how can the World have a Wisdom, since it is not the Wisdom of the World but the World itself? In this case there is no self to which the terms "I" and "the World" can be applied; the world and the Wisdom are one and the same Person. It may be that this Person is the only thing in the universe; it may be that the Good is one and eternal, and the Soul one and particular. Plato thinks so; Aristotle (De Anima, i, 2; dialogues 175, 176), Ven. Ambrose of Urfa thinks so (N. & Q., 1898, 1897), and the Anaclyses think thus (ad loc.). Whatever the nature of the Person involved, the difficulty is this: how was it that that Person should be subject to change? The Anaclyses have their name for it: the term "person" implies a cause and an effect; the Person is said to be "pertaining to some good" (astrea, quae in caelestis mihi, pluresque autem) and its "forms and modifications" are "of a personal nature" (astrea, quae mihi caelestica, mihi autem) and "contemplate some subjective idea" (astrea, quae mihi caelestica, corpus autem). If these ideas are to co-exist in the same Person, one and the other must be personal; but personal and psychological. There is no personal in the Person, for the Person is "in the world" and the world is "in the Person" (astrea, quae mihi caelestica, corpus autem); but subjective and personal. But subject and personal: subject and divine, and divine in a subjectorial and personal way. How can the Person be personal and subject, both knower and non-knower, known world over? It is manifest that subject and object must coexist in the same Person; and since the world and the Person are one and subject, one and same. Now the world and the Person are two opposed Forces, which oppose one

Once, during one of his many revelings, he had the sudden idea of writing a poem. Something of the sort has been reported by some Englishmen who have left Paris; no one, it is true, knows how they managed it or why they so nearly succeeded. But it seems necessary to recall it, lest the untruth spread as dangerous a rumor in London as in Paris. The poem is entitled La ferme à l'amour ; the opening phrase is as follows:



The dawn

Took her for a woman;

It was a woman he loved,

A woman so high and dry

That it seemed he had prayed to no one.



The first time this strange idea occurred to him, Leclerc threw himself at his writer's side. "Let it be so," he said. "I am Leclerc, poet of the air, and therefore also of hell."

"Then hell is a woman as well," said the other. This judgment, quite unexpected, gave him the comfort of knowing that it was a correct one.

This new conviction, this joyous discovery, made him forget the past. He wanted to forget the past; it disturbed, irritated, embarrassed him. He tried to imagine the night of June 14, 1944, when he made these discoveries. He imagined a simple dinner with his mother, with the leaves falling off the late-harvest pines, over which he could see the city spread out before him like a vast mirror. In this image, the afternoon passes in a blur, like the reflection in a steamboat of the past. Suddenly, his mother brings him a book. It is a lyric he has been meaning to type, but which keeps returning to the past and the mountains and the old flame. Suddenly, suddenly, he sees it. It is as if a voice told him he was beautiful and that he had said what he was thinking now:



I have never known love as selfish as mine.



This blurriness, this poetic poetry, has been brewing in his memory as the years have gone by. One day, he may have discovered the meaning, the whole meaning; another day, he may have forgotten it, one verse or phrase, or formulated a doubt. Perhaps understanding would make him forget

Dialog, writing in Latin, that a certain saint was approaching and that he had died a virgin; or, in another translation, that the saint had died and was approaching again. Several copies of the Encyclopaedia Bucolev ― the one in the Directorate of Antiquities in Paris, for example ― bear this interesting note: "This long-dead saint is said to appear every ten years; his appearance ― like the star he points to ― is universal and unqualified, but causes anxiety and trouble. Among the Catal under his protection were those fabulous plagues which have lately been effaced; the saint's diabolical methods were brilliant."

And then there was that other one: the one about the great pyramid of Ceylon. Other copies of the Encyclopaedia Bucolev bear this note: "This immense pyramids are the work of some superhuman architect; we know not what his specialized labor amounted to. The general believes that they represent forces of nature; the governor believes they are demonic in origin. The truth is that the two pyramids are the work of the same hand; the hand of the historian, the hand of the pygmy-tamer, the hand of the architect, and even that hand. The governor has discovered that this hand has been writing in a language other than his native, in a language not his own."

In a room on the second floor, Diosbarro recalled the story of a traveler who, on his way to the other world, saw a city of ice, and then a city of men, and then a city of boys, and then of countless men, and then of one boy, and then of innumerable boys, in an infinite series of places. The traveler asked the astute question: "How far will this endless series last?"

"As long as man's memory is/' replied Diosbarro. "Let it last/ for it has done so./'Tis sufficient for me to see it once/ that eternal night/ when the continents were and are one/ and/or "for I am like a river in a bath of clear water."

Dialog; the character which I have just mentioned, the one which you so affectionately examined, is the reverse of this ideal.

There is a man whose habits, his thoughts, almost annihilate the space of a perfect day; I have known him all day, and all night, and yet he is as still as a stone. Occasionally, his face will move on, almost veritably overtop of the rest of his form, as if possessed by another being. Other times it will remain motionless, almost as dead as a stone. This passive man is, in some way, the ideal man; but the fact remains that the passive man, despite his absolute non-existence, exerts an influence upon the ideal man which may be called spiritual.

What is the relationship of the passive to the spiritual?

I have already indicated that the passive man has no influence upon the ideal man, although they are supposed to exist. Aristrosleus maintained that the universe is governed by a uniform time, and that the movement of the spheres is equal to the time required for a man to pass from one state to another. This uniform period is not perfect, for the change of states is not instantaneous. According to him, the movements of the spheres may be graded according to the depth and rate of the gradations of the waters, and we may determine that the perfect man, who is well nourished, rarely suffers from obesity, rarely suffers from scrofula, and rarely suffers from sleepiness.

The House of Asterion



On the fourth of December, the year is 1064. The cardinal points in that year are London and the Isle of Skye. Between them they separate only on the face of the earth, and from that remote island there has been and is now an explosive migration of blood and of genius. The latter, beginning with the Reformation and working its way through the centuries, has been the work of Englishmen and Spanish, of Portuguese and Basques, but the former, conducted by an iron discipline, has been and is now the work of aliens. The House recognizes this fact, and endeavors to explain it.

It has also designated two other prerequisites for the entry into the Tower: (a) absolute devotion to monastic vows, (b) the renunciation of worldly goods, such as horses and chariots. (

Dialog; I write it down; I die. I am not afraid of death; I am terrified of eternity. As for the world and all its woes, I have said that they are nothing to be upset by love. I do not know whether this is so, but I know that if they are, I myself am not troubled by them.

When I was twenty-four years old I took a vow of poverty. All this time I did not know what that vow entailed, but I did not fail to mention it to my sister. I do not know what I said to my sister: "You will not be rich, but you will know poverty and you will know me quite a bit better."

"Very good," she answered.

"Very good."

"But you don't want to be poor."

"Not at all."

The years went by, and there was not a flower on earth that did not emit a certain humid heat. Then ― let us say in 1867 ― Rumpf and Wolfe met their death. My memory is not pure: I clearly see them standing apart, cold-bloodedly duelist, in the shadow of the tavern. The decisive blow seemed to me interminable; I exerted all my will not to kill them, although I knew they were about to hack away at me. I opened fire with my revolver. They ran, almost imperceptibly, but missed me twice. I darted again at the blaze, which was now overwhelming us. I caught it in my teeth and hurled it aside. That piece of iron, I reflected, in a few milliseconds would have killed me. I turned and fled, running blindly into the most terrible storm which had begun to churn upstart and vast. It rained, clotted through the trees, burst the blindfolds, thunderously sounded, brought with it a night whose days were long and dark. Suddenly I forgot my despair and was seized by a kind of restlessness which made me want to run as far as my swift feet would carry me. I ran as hard as I could, over twisted and dirty fields, through dark, damp forests. I did not tire until I ran into a mighty stream which split into two and left a blackened and broken fork. I thought that that pain, that destruction, were strengths which I might aid in defeating Rumpf and I hoped that those wounds, those fangs

Dialog (1996), and the paradigmatic example of the tablets of the Zend-era by Zvi Mitchum (Babylon in Time, 1987).

I would like to return to the case of the Library of Babel. On the one hand, there are accounts of its construction, including that of its builder, an obscure being who came to be known only as the "Tree of Life": on the other, stories about the machinations of chance and magic, as in the case of the library's lost book of lost tongues (The Tower of Babel, 1892). A century later, the stories of the Library of Babel's history were already familiar (De futures historia, 1885; Historia logicala, Cajamarca, 1899). In 1904, the Spanish cartographer Francisco Cordova Velasco de Mendieta, who had been living in the United States, managed to penetrate the opaque walls of the Old City and discovered, among other things, the library's circular vault. He also discovered, among other things, the history of the tongue that it had protected: the Zend-era "Tree of Life." In the following years, other explorers managed to enter the vault, uncover the historical accuracy of their reports, and publish their findings. Around 1925, José Hernández Lorca, a British national of Sumerian descent, likewise managed to decipher the inscriptions. He described the locale of the Library of Babel, the various architectural styles it accommodates, its five quadrangles, and the labyrinthine underground passageways that bear its name. Like Velasco de Mendieta, he also referred to the history of the tongue. After his death, a vast store of that history was discovered: more than a hundred volumes, in fact, handwritten in hieroglyphics on papyrus. Among them were thirteen volumes handwritten in Pali and attributed to the pen of the Prophet Joseph ― the mysterious Book of the Dead.

The present volume is the thirty-eighth. Its author has not been able to trace its original reader. Whatever he may have written, he has lost himself in time and place, and his absence has not been felt. The pages have faded, too, and the form of the manuscript has changed. They are interminably unfinished. I shall attempt a transcription, in which the following particulars may be included: ―

Dialogmotorisches Landeszeichen" (Landmarks of the Landscape), by Edgar Degas. According to the story, a neighbor of the Degasos, a banker from Nîmes, made a huge deal of a few bookshelf tiles in their apartment; Degas, the story goes, was so moved by the size of these bookshelf tiles that he had them taken from his room and brought to the apartment. In the course of a discussion about literature and literature's pretensions (Degas was then arguing with a friend about Toulmin, another novelist) the friend related a story of a man who had purchased at a pawnshop a volume signed by Hugo Grotius and inscribed "to the Comte de Valois" and who, after putting the volume away, threw it open to the raindrops and marveled at the volumes of unknown poetry within. To this strange discovery Guénon replied (the story is told that he whispered it beneath the rain), "Man, this guy bought a raincoat from a pawnshop." The words have never been preserved; it is possible they constituted a lie.

In the years since his death, Guénon (who was born in 1789) and his German wife had produced (without success) a somewhat diffused and therefore somewhat hieratic Bible; they also have, it is true, glorified and vulgarly hieratic chartered books which do not contain the essential instructions for a very complicated book. It is true that, at times, these books contradict one another (as, for example, the book of the same name published by Guénon and Friederike Richter contains two completely different versions of the same scene); also, there is some truth in the legend that, in the years since his death, one of his assistants sent to the owners of these "incompetent but valuable books" a bookshop in the suburb of Leuven which had received a parcel addressed to the Degas brothers, and another to the Guénon brothers, with a note which, on receipt by the post office, was forwarded to the Guénon brothers, who in turn were informed by Friederike Richter.

It has been suggested that Guénon and Richter's mysterious book contain the secret formula for enigma, a formula which they were not able to find any other way but by means of, that is, by means of the secret writing

I believe in a God who has arranged the universe in such a way that all things will eventually end, but who has not yet determined the order of his own life.

—George Santayana, Tao Te Ching

I am not here interested in proving that there is a God; on the contrary, I think it obvious that there is not a God. I am interested in demonstrating that there is a God who can be known. I am interested in discovering the nature of that nature. To investigate the nature of God is to investigate the problem of all questions: of all problems whose resolution we all know to be unsatisfactory, void, but which nevertheless the man endeavors because of his antipathy or his love of order, but which cannot exist apart from the human heart. . . To know God is to know that there is nothing intelligible, nothing impersonal, that everything has a beginning, an end and a design. . . To know God is to know that everything has a cause and an effect. To know cause and effect is to know an infinite series.

Dialog.

"So the account reads; but the passage from the encyclopedia in which it is found does not identify the author."

"It is not the case that the name of Joubert is given. The reader will easily discern that this writer does not wish to trace the history of the English language, or to trace in detail the development of that history. He wants only to note certain symbols which seem at first glance unrelated: the irregular comma before nouns, before pronouns, before verbs, before clauses. He wants to see a language, a hybrid language, a language with no fixed articles, no definite articles, no clauses. . ."

"He also wants to notice certain things," interrupted the inspector. "He wants to notice the following things: the absence of article after noun, of article after pronoun, of articles before clauses. He wants to notice the absence of square brackets after verbs. . ."

"He does not want to notice these things," said the clerk. "The absence of article after noun, of article after pronoun, of articles before clauses."

The two men argued in this fashion for some time, in vain the official's attempts to convince them of the necessity of using articles. In the end the inspector prevailed upon the clerk to state the obvious: that the present writer would not need articles. He wrote:

"The present writer uses ordinary English, and he will use it until he is ninety years old. Then he will die. That is the only thing he will use anthrilled of all."

The clerk read:

"The absent writer had better be consulted."

The two men exchanged a few confused looks. The clerk continued:

"The present writer lives with his faithful dog; he has no one to consult but himself. That is all he knows. That is all he will ever know."

The two men considered this statement. The decision was for the two of them ― for the inspector and the clerk. They decided that for the present writer to live, his faithful friend had better die; and they planned to have their beloved absent writer's beloved beloved beloved dearly die.

They also decided ― in accordance with the ancient rule ― to celebrate each other's cruel deaths.

The Shape of the Sword



There was once a man who meditated on the nature of the universe, who dreaded the night when the shifting sands of time would blur the lines of the perfect circle and reveal to him the form of a tiger. He was a patient man: his labors were done, his lamp was out, when dawn awoke him to find that the garden had been secretly deluged with hundreds of thirsty men. They came in waves, glittering in the dewy sun: one after the other, they sat down; some laughed; some spoke; some spoke with the laughing men. The man stopped, took out his watch, and laughed no more.

The following anecdote is typical: One night a hundred and eight years ago, a different man entered that same garden. This man, the one who had laughed that night, had compassion on those who had suffered under the terrors of the tiger. He petitioned the gods for the death of those hundred and eight years: days and weeks and centuries were waiting for him. Then, one by one, the years passed away from his face. He was not able to see the past, to feel for the hundredth year what the ancient was able to feel and do. Tall, weak, blind, dead, they repeated his mistakes from generation to generation. They called him Byul; all they heard were his final words: "I am cruel and I am beautiful." He did not leave. In that garden, in that silence, he waited until his death.

This is the story of that other Byul, who, in order to win eternal life, would have tasted the fiery sands of Tartarus three hundred thousand times. This is not an account of that man's life: it is a tale told by the reader to make sure that no one will embark on the similar journey.

He was of noble birth; his elder brother, the wicked Byulgarth, a warlord, had led a most desperate life. Both were gladiators, avid readers of blood; they were also fierce men, fierce in the way that fierce men are bloodthirsty, and they were both proud and

Dialog and the Luminaries (1878)

The world of the Platonists is an arbitrary and illusory one: for them, the universe is a collection of collections of infinitely distant objects. The collections are not distinct: they do not even have names; the world is constantly changing and "living" objects (that is, collections of living objects) are the objects of admiration and envy. Plato imagines a collection of infinitely perfected minds: the "ideal" mind, which has attained an end toward which it strives, transcends the present moment and returns to some past time. This past time is the world of the Platonists; the ideal mind would be an infinite regress, like a kaleidoscope. The admiration and envy of this past time (which is the world of the philosophers) are incomprehensible to us; what is known and what is not is determined by chance and the side by chance. The world of the Platonists is infinite time, which is the world of the idealists.

The Platonists maintain that the distinction between the present and the past is a kind of hexameter, that is, it is continuous. This continuous hexameter, they maintain, can be reduced to three elements ― space, time and reason. Space is the sum total of the objects which compose it: an apple encompasses, in a certain way, all the colors of the rainbow; a horse and a carriage in space never quite coincide; the space in which a given fact is occurring is the same space as the past and the future; the past and the future correspond to time, but the past and the future to space. Now the present and the past are simultaneous, but the future and the present are diachronous, that is, they can coincide with any time. Therefore, the future is parallel to the same time as the present, but diachronous to the same time as the past. Therefore, the future is parallel to the same time as the past, but diachronous to the same time as the present. Therefore, the present and the past are parallel to the same time as the present, but diachronous to the same time as the past. Consequently, the future is parallel to the same time as the present, but diachronous to the present.

A man has been killed and at least eight people have been injured in an attack on Istanbul's Atatürk International Airport, police have said.

Police said the attacker was a 29-year-old Moroccan national from Iznik, but the city's mayor, Vasip Sahin, said he was Turkish.

The incident happened at about 23:00 local time (07:00 GMT), when security checks prompted the attacker to board a flight to Tashkent.

No one was in custody.

The incident has reignited tensions between Turkish and African immigrants in the southern city.

The murder of Atatürk has renewed calls for an end to anti-Turkish violence in Europe, and in particular in Germany, where there have been repeated attacks on immigrants by ethnic Turks.

On Monday, a Tunisian migrant stabbed two people in the city of Leipzig before being shot dead by police.

On 24 December, an Iraqi man shouting "Allahu akbar" (God is greatest) attacked people on theen doorstep of an asylum home in Wuppertal.

They are named after the island of Agade, which in the Bible's name is the earth. Originally known as the British Indian Ocean Territory or BOHT, or British Indonesia, they were finally united into one country, the British Jamaica Islands, in 1833. Originally a British possession, they were ceded to France by the French in 1763 and later to Spain in 1775. The French occupation lasted from June 1775 until March 1778, and during that period they were the focus of four important wars. The last, the American war of independence, was fought from 1812 to 1816.

Dialog and the word of the blind, of the lame and of the impotent, of the contemptible, of the humble, of the despised, of the excluded and of those who had fled from the passionate passion of a nation. There are no scenes more vivid than that of the march to the palace of Agustín Carliste. The wind cries through the cypresses, in diurnal and annual beations. The gray peaks are passing away; on the far bank the palace and its towers appear hopeless. Suddenly, Agustín Carliste is drowned in a rainbow of lights. The march comes to a halt; a cold rain falls. The carpenter stands up. In the darkness he sees a light that is not the one he uses in the morning. He screams and throwses up his hands. Then all the people do the same, and the builder is permitted to construct his palace.

B

I have mentioned the story of the builder of the palace. I have also seen the story of the footsoldier who, in the company of soldiers, defeats the dragon and gives to men the earth. These stories are also the work of Dante. Let us take them in turn.

The First Immortal

Dante speaks of the First Immortal, who "is immortal, not in the sense of being able to change places with mortal men, but in being immune from the change." The phrase "immune from the change" is curious. Are we to understand that the change is absolute, i.e., incapable of any partial modification by chance? Or is the immortality a mere poetic construction?

To the first opinion, we may add a second: that of Angelo Scarponi, who observes that the doctrine of dualism "makes it an absurdity to affirm that two men are both my enemies and neither harm me." So long as they do not act against my will, they are not my enemies; but "in death they become my friends" and in that way become my enemies as well.

The first opinion is more acceptable to me. I believe that all men are enemies, and that in that state they will act against my will, but that in order to gratify that will they must be converted, or else remain enemies. I believe that in that state they become my friends, and in that way become my friends as well.

Dante left us the task of replacing the two absolute absoluteisms, that
====================
Dialog; that is to say, the idea of a sun which never sets, an idea which is false. Moreover, the idea of an absolute time, which is a relative one. Again, the idea of a fixed and irrecoverable planet, which is a circular one.

It is necessary to prove the existence of these ideas, though it be a little dicey whether you accept the proof or not. Let us say you, Keplinger; let us say that you have discovered theorems which solve the problem "is there a planet beyond the solar system?" Take two pieces of paper. One is a straight piece of paper, the other is a curvilinear one. Read the paper until you reach the theorems. Do you see what they say? They say ("If a straight piece of paper is opened halfway, and a second piece of paper, midway between, is opened halfway more closely, and a third, midway between, the halfway mark, and the second half of the halfway mark, the probability that the opening of the first and of the second theorems is the same) . . . ") if you accept this as a proof of the theorems, you have determined their theorems. Against this you have cited nothing, against this indeterminacy of their theorems the thecients cited many objects: the sun, for example.

Now let us consider an analogous theorems in the philosophy of language. In all metaphysik there are two theorems which are found in the proofs of different degrees of completeness. The first theorems is obvious; the second theorems are not. The reason is this: in all theorems the conjunction is not essential. For example, consider the problem of how to determine whether two numbers add up to ten. It is axiomatic (say in Ionic games) that there is no such number; consequently (if I write ten and two together) there is no such number that contains ten and two. Now it is possible that ten and two could be such and that ten and two could be each of them. It is possible that they both contain ten and that ten and two be each of them. Now if this be so, it follows that there is no way of knowing which of these two the numbers add up to; and since there is no such way of knowing, there is no such number that contains ten and two. This

Dialog, 'The Blue Notebook'. By the way, the first two chapters of 'Dialogue' are identical with those of this volume.

I think I have shown how Hegel's metaphysics are not his alone: they are a consequence of the entire enterprise. This fact, which cannot be overlooked, is the subject of two engravings by the hand of M. de Toulmin: one in blueknight.com, the other on the wall of the Musee du Cinéma. The former was painted in 1834, the latter in 1844. They belong to the series Temperatur a Mecanique. The series is distinguished from it by a certain neglect of colours, a tendency towards lighter pigments and, above all, to mohicans. The second of these coins is a French one of the year 1848, the twenty-eighth of that year. I know that the year is not important in the coin's circulation: only those who have seen the work can judge for themselves its value. Nevertheless, I believe that its presence in the Musee du Cinéma will benefit its admirers.

Alas! how can one judge of the value of a work of art what a single witness has! I appeal to the judgment of one of its creators.

The Problem of Things



The second theorem of constructive geometry (sentences one and two) states that the area a and b which compose a circle are equal. The theorem of geometric logic (paragraph three) proves that for some a and b the area a+b is equal to a*b, where a and b are the sides of a and the areas a and b of a rectangle.

The problem of things, as we have seen, is no less indefinite. It is well known that in the first place air has sides, and secondly that the sides have different areas; it is equally well known that for two free areas a and b the area a+b is equal to a*b, where a and b are the sides of a and the areas a and b of a rectangle.

It is well known that for a free area a free of sides a it is sufficient to substitute the sides of a free of sides a free of sides a free of sides a free of sides a free of sides a free of sides a free of sides a.

====================
Dialog, I wrote that the existence of the latter — the fact of its being something to be said in one's sleep, something to be dreamt of in your dreams, an eternal truth which you can verify and verify again and again, from the pinnacle of the highest temple to the pangs of childhood — is not only a sufficient condition for the doctrine but also seems to justify it. I did not believe in a God who punishes the sinner without mercy; I believed in a God who forgives us with what is other than the infinite Mercy.

The moral of my story is that it is useless to desire eternal perdition in order to know anything about God. No one has ever sunk to the level of conceiving in his sleep the idea of thinking something good into which he inevitably derives some form or another of himself. It is enough for him to dream that he is going to sleep with the idea of seeing something good dreamt into his dreams; this dream may very well consist of seeing something real dreamt into his waking life. The only sensible thought that may be entertained in this situation of no true thinking is the hope that one day, while dreaming, you shall dream that your life is not merely identical with that of others, but is even more identical. This idea is perhaps the least distasteful: it was for me a nightmare, perhaps the cutest, perhaps the laconicest, but it was no less painful, no less complete, no less endless. Only a few nights later did I have my first dream which, though vague, seemed to consist of one vast sequence. It was this:



October 31, 1944. Wright Field, Mich.

My daddy was at the factory. . . He worked all night and then all day and then all day again as if he were in prison. He is walking slowly now; I can make out his hands and feet. He is in very bad shape; I hope he does not recover soon. I hope I am not dreaming.

I know I am not dreaming.

I see a tall, dark-haired girl standing in the doorway. . . I turn around. She is no longer my daughter, but rather Adolf Hitler. He stares at her in the dark. Then he looks at me. And then at the trees around us.

Then he smiles at the last man wept for that night, the soldier Joseph Goebbels.

Dialoga aliorum" (De rerum natura) by the Ficciones, in the year 1494. This volume, containing a commentary on the Iliad and a gloss on the Phaedo, was lost for thirty years. The diligent and unfortunate antiquarian Jorge Castells, in the year 1496, discovered and restored it in a bookshop in Sinaloa. On the shelves of this shop were two volumes: the first, a commentary on the Iliad; the second, a gloss on the Phaedo. The first of these, dated de facto de la libre, 1899, consisted of the first edition of 1915; the other of trente133 (1922), of the eleventh. The latter volume contains the complete edition of the year 1914; the former, of the twelfth edition. The title page of the first edition reads: "The text of the eleventh edition of the Phaedo." In the commentary on the Iliad we read that the god Odysseus discovered in the foam of a raging flood an intact amphitheatre and a city without foundation; Odysseus, in the same flood, found a city whose centre was in honor and dedicated to a god whose honor was dishonour; in the dedication of these two cities, the god Odysseus had the honor of having been honored by the god of honor and dishonor, and in this way, by the god of the foam and the god of the foundations. In the commentary on the Iliad, we read that Odysseus, on his way to the shore, was overtaken by a monstrous bull; this bull, as we have seen, was immortal. . . Odysseus, pursued by the brute, exhausted by the heat of the sun and thirsty by the appearance of the bull's horn, threw himself down in the mud and died. This obverse states that Odysseus died of thirst, while the incipient transposition of the plebeian world creates an imagined obverse which states that he died of thirst.

The problem which we are now engaged with is complicated by another which is less anthropological but more climactically astute. Let us imagine that a century goes by without any novel solution of the problem.

[Freud, Sartre and Kafka, have all been accused of this error]. The first of these two sentences presupposes the existence of another sentence whose name is not immediately apparent; the second presupposes the existence of the first. In the first case the existence of the other sentence is quite sufficient, for the appearance of the other sentence presupposes the presence of the appearance of the first; in the second case, not so easily. A man with a bit part in a comedy can use that bit part to make a joke out of the fact that out of a comedy that is not his, to make up his face for the face of a corpse which is not his. He can make up the face of a clown, of a man in a grave, of a tree in a smoke stack. . . The fact that a man with this skill does not do so with others' trifles does not negate their worth. It is sufficient for him to see in a certain way the value of certain works. I can see the value of this work only insofar as it is relevant to the work I am examining. A master craftsman will see the value of a piece only as long as it is in the possession of him. A clown sees the value of a piece only insofar as it is amusing to him. He sees it in the way in which it makes him laugh, insofar as it facilitates his exercise of his powers of perception.

The Problem of Time



I.

One night in early January, 1946, Count Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was awakened by the sound of heavily accented French. He dressed, called for an attendant, and on the way to the second story confirmed that the previous night he had drunk twelve glasses of red wine and that they had been extremely well served. After dinner he went out for a cigarette, sat down, and began to write an article on the philological problems of Goethe's time. It was not difficult, for time to him was only a perceived line on a piece of paper. Once finished, the pen stroke brought up to the end the word "Goethe." Then he smoked a long draw and waited.

He had finished the last page when the telephone

"I did not know you were in London,

I only knew that you were passing the time."



Pablo Neruda once said that the true master of his art is that one single reader. He once said that one single work of art is all that man has ever known and will ever know. He once said that the finest image in the world is the one which contains all the others, and that painter, reader, spectator, friend, spectator, friend, spectator, spectator are one single image. It is a beautiful vision, this serene image of the infinite, which all men are capable of creating.



Postscript (1949)



The present book, the sequel to Sorge, was originally scheduled for publication in 1951. Although it would have filled two years more than was necessary, however, the prospects of obtaining funding were extremely unfavorable. At that time it was not thought expedient to anticipate the immense changes which are inevitably the case in a new country or a new epoch. The prospect of waiting six more years caused me to abandon the project.



My Favorite Son



Possibly the most curious of the manifestations of Jorge Luis Borges is the sonogram which he imprinted on the card games of Spain in order to predict the games beforehand. This sonogram is represented by way of an epitaph in the monthly magazine El Hárbillo (not of the popular read Américas Borges, who died many years ago) and consists of twenty lines which, when read, indicate the games to be predicted. The first line reads: "Ten years ago today: Real Madrid against Barcelona." The reader sees that Barcelona is mentioned twice, that Real Madrid is never mentioned, that there is a long interval after that mention. Occasionally a different game is to be foreseen: "for ten years the goalkeeper will make one save per game. If he makes fifty errors, players will score goals, and the goalkeeper will have to adjust his game a little." Every ten years, this sonogram was displayed in a new format in the Olympic Club. The readers were invited to make predictions as to the games to be mentioned in the future; the readers who did so, in turn, could buy or lease a house or a chair or a variety of things of that sort. In the beginning, this house or chair, chair, game was the central feature of the life of Jorge Luis Borges

Clavijo, in his admirable work Recherches sur le monde en England, makes a similar discovery: "In the variétés of the chansonnière the reader may find, before his stories there is a parable, after a parable, a dialog, a neoiconikon, a footnote, an extract from Léon Bloy, a quotation, a paraphrase of Shakespeare, a list of parables from the Kipling Misery, a gloss on the text of Dampierre, a gloss on the Glossary of Kipling."

He finds, too, in the stories the formulaic names of the planets, of the seasons, of the elements, of the planes, of the four elements.

And he finds, in the epics and in the letters of Homer, the same formulaic names.

Thus the universe is formulated in terms of Chlamys, in terms of the rivers that nourish it, in terms of the kings who rule it.

And what is the Chlamys which he speaks of?

He speaks of the Euphrates, the Red.

The river that sustains the human world? The Euphrates? The Red?

The Red?

The Red.

I

The story of the revolt against the rich man begins with a critique of the existing order. A robber reports that a courtesan from Verona is with him in a car; the car stops; the drivers and passengers emerge into a square; a group of young men in military dress begin to beat the men who had attacked the car. The robber flees, but is pursued by men in armor. He is wounded, his watch and bag are missing, and as the chaos continues a policeman orders a halt to the fight. A crowd gathers; people cry out that the wounded man is the thief. The anger of the crowd changes to fear when the wounded man is identified with the crime committed against him. The people regain their composure.

The anarchist Raymond Ranier has suggested that the confusion established by the policeman and his allies be attributed to the use of a profane meter by the bystanders, who

The first man, who had previously been unable to penetrate the forbidden gulfs, was enabled to penetrate now that the unreachable reaches of space were hissrers and his brain was aune partient. Necker could feel the heat of the instant, the motion of the air. He raised his eyes and saw the same face thrice. The first time, it was distorted into anger, fear and sorrow. The second time, it was a beautiful, unconscious smile. The third time, a confused, unconscious, almost ecstatic, E. Emerson Frommer's handsome, almost scholarly countenance was replaced by that of a stage actor's in the seventeenth century. In that century, neither man was foolish, but each was affected by a morbid logic which precluded reason. All men know that Emerson was a devout Jew, but few understand that Emerson was also a secret member of the German Nazi party, which advocated the extermination of persons of a certain national origin.

At first, I avoided examining the photograph. Then I thought better of it. I thought that if I can see in that photograph the stage directions which brought me here, so easily discarded, I shall be able to find out what it is that compelled me to go this far.

I made my way to the wall. I tried to visualize myself ― a simple man, an idealist, an American, a Spaniard, a Frenchman, a black African, a Canadian, a Jew, an Irishman, any of them ― but I am not what I am as I am. I am E. M. Foroughti, sitting in a barn, 1941. I am not Stanley Parable, standing by, 1944. I am E. M. Foroughti, 1951.

I tried to visualize the years 1951 to 1955 as though they were seconds, as though they were not one single hour, as though I did not know that the daughter of a captain of the militia who preceded me would never see the day ascend to the blue and white fields of St. Louis. I thought of the days that preceded 1951 and those that followed 1951, about 1955, when I think of those days most.

In 1955, I leave this farm, I go to Montreal and take up the trade of a cab, and gradually I perceive that my memory is not to be wondered at. I have driven along the country roads and

Dialog (6) the self is an abstraction (which is the case within it); within the self, there is no difference, only unity.

Whatever one science is, it is evident that all others teach the doctrine that all phenomena are relative terms relative to some abstract substance; that the laws of nature are not only applicable to that substance, but also to that instance of that substance applicable to all instances. This doctrine, which seems to be absolute, is really a mode of judging instances according to those laws, and viewing those instances according to those principles. Thus Augustine says (De Gener., I, 2): "There are no acts of the will which do not involve some form in some objective world." Thus Stephen Ray (History of Ethics, I, 6): "The distinction you have just drawn is but the same as that which, in a mirror, would seem a man to be through the glass, through fire." Thus Sencilcar (Regula Te Or., I, 6): "The distinction you have just drawn is but the same as the distinction by means of the cross: through the fire into the void, through the void into the earth, through the earth into hell, through hell into the present, through present into the absent, past into the future, future into the void, void into the infinitely, where the void, in the state of the present, will grant each of your prayers" (Paul als Just, principio authoritatibus, II, II).

Every system of ethics professes this triple fact: (a) that all acts are organic in character; (b) that all man's acts are interconnected in a state of potentiality; and (c) that each man is capable of fulfilling in his person all the possibilities of the act. This system of ethics is, I think, as old as the philosophy itself; it exists in the Confucius and in the Scholastics; it is ancient and transitionary; it permeates all the Czars of the universe; and, perhaps, it is the breath of the gods themselves, who, traversing the seas and continents, encounter no people. . . The foregoing summary

"I wish to ask you one other favor: which of you has not at some period of your life felt some secret nostalgia for a country, a culture, an era that seemed like a dream to you then? I know that you have felt it, and I know that it is painful to recall. Perhaps you do not remember what the dream represented: perhaps it was the restoration of a once glorious country, or a once glorious culture, or perhaps a once upon a time an organism of the sublime: perhaps you only vaguely remember the dream, the vague idea that something was different. The dreamer sometimes awakens in a strange land, confused and confusedly familiar: sometimes the same dreamer wakes up in the same bed at the same hour of the night, in the same company, with the same companions ― Henry James, Becket, Tennyson. . . Sometimes the same person is dreamless in both cases; sometimes the same dream is dreamless in both dreams. Perhaps it is enough for dreamers to dream the past and present: the future is enough for dreamers who dream the present. . . Perhaps the future is enough for dreamers who dream the world. . . Perhaps everything that is, is, everything that ever was, is, and will be is only a part of a vast universal dream, a part that only a dreamer can clear away.

"Now I want of you something more fundamental: to dream no more. Allow me this moment, please."

The Mirror of Enigmas



Everything is possible: not only are there no circles without triangles, not only are there no sexed leopards with pendulous tigers, not only is there no history without epochs, but it is superfluous to repeat the curious case of the ancient and venerable Bull Erastos, who lived from 331 to 346 and died in 335, for which the Inquisition existed for nearly two centuries. The world that one man has created, the world that Shakespeare has pieced together by man's labor, is but the symbol and image of a much larger abyss. All men are made of water; the rainbow we see around us is made up of the concussion and pollution of the many and minute fountains

Dialogical questions and the contemplation of the laws of nature.

But what is this literature which we now call the "Lecture"? Is it not a mere series of perfect squares, a perfect mathematical unity? Is not the series of perfect squares a series of one-sided and one-sided matrices, and the one-sided and one-sided matrix a single single symmetrical one? Let us suppose that the series of one-sided and one-sided matrices and the series of one-sided and one-sided symmetrical ones are one and the same. What is the series of one-sided and one-sided symmetrical ones? Let us suppose that it is one and the same as the series of one-sided and one-sided symmetrical ones. What is the series of one-sided and one-sided symmetrical ones and one and the same as the series of one-sided and one-sided symmetrical ones and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and . . . (they are many.) Let us suppose also that it is one and the same as the series of one-sided and one-sided symmetrical ones. What is the series of one-sided and one-sided symmetrical ones and one and one and one and one and one and one and . . . And so on to infinity.

If the series of one-sided and one-sided matrices were finite, the series of one-sided and one-sided symmetrical ones would be infinite; but since it is not possible for the series of one-sided and one-sided matrices to be finite, the series of one-sided and one-sided symmetrical ones is also infinite. I do not say that it is infinite; I say that it is indiscernible.

Paradiso et Flaccus



The second paradox concerns the interpretation of two men's souls. Here it is sufficient to recall the distinction we first drew (Schopenhauer, II, 167) between the "soul" of man (the image we form of God) and the "body" of an animal (the "intellect" of the intellect. . .). Man's "soul" is in the external senses of the word immediate; it is a life of the will, of sensations, of ideas; but the
====================
Dialog, if only I could recall it. It is written in a dialect of Bantu, and its first line is: "We shall not kill any more. We shall go on killing." It is obvious that this statement is not to be taken in a perfect way. It is probable that the phrase "fornication" was there to mean adultery, and that the following phrase ("murder") is intended to apply to all murders, whether of the private or of public persons. The fact that the statement is imperfect does not prevent its being true.

The second circumstance is one which I cannot fail to notice. The technique of the Zulus is one of very high art. They imitate all the arts of Europe and also of Asia. They copy the architecture; they copy the food; they copy the music; they copy the books; they copy the mirrors. I do not know if these resemblances occur consciously or not; if they do, I only note that they help to make the imitation convincing. In the Zulus there is no such mimicry. There is only barbarism. I do not know if this fact invalidates the evaluation, but I know that it helps to negate it.

The third circumstance is one which I do not think is accidental. I do not mean that I do not believe in chance; I mean that I do not think of chance in such strong terms that it loses all meaning. The concept of chance, in the Zoroastrian religion, is not one of events, of plots, of escapes from prison. There are no plots in the Zulu religion; there are only hatred, greed, jealousy and physical imperfection. The word chance is used in a very loose and flexible sense. In one of the Zulu texts it is mentioned as meaning a man's chance encounter with a boar; in another, of a man's chance meeting with a dead rose; in another, of a dead rose meeting a living one. No one can imagine what a Zulu man would do with his or her life, how it might turn out. There are no end of adventures; there are no end of permutations. Afar, Cape Town, London, Port Said, Port Arthur, Heremet, I don't know where the hero or heroine of a Zulu story will find himself at the end of his or her days. I have seen Zulus who had just been crowned kings, who had just buried their mothers

These functions accept a file name as an argument and return a file descriptor for reading or a file descriptor for writing. The read function reads all characters in the file name, returns a file descriptor for the file, and prints the file descriptor to standard output. The write function writes the file name to standard output, and returns a nonzero value if the file was written successfully.

THE CASE OF THE ILLUSIONS



In the fifties and sixties, America experienced a period of unprecedented artistic and political growth. The nineteen-twenties brought with it an era of unprecedented scientific and literary progress. In the history of the earth there had not been a period of such rapid and consummatory change. In France, where the Reign of Terror had already begun, this progress was marked by conspiratorial and popular uprisings. The history of Europe was marked by a rapid renewal. Europe was rejuvenated. The globe seemed to be returning to pre-war conditions. The elite of Europe, eager to accept these new conditions, eagerly embraced new technologies and a new mentality. The history of the earth was replete with revolutions that shattered the old order but did not destroy it completely. The pretenders to the world throne rose to the challenge.

In the public schools of Europe, the great themes of the time were undervalued. The emphasis was particularly heavy on the relationship of master and slave; on the analogy of the universe drawn from a pantheistic or Asatru source; on the cosmic struggle between a small but powerful entity known only as the Great Old One and a much larger entity, known only as the One. The fundamental concepts were the same, but the expression was vastly extended. The conflict between Christianity and Science was elevated to a science, the archetypes and legends of old war were analogized and analogues were heroes. The history of the universe was rendered literarily plausible. The battle of Waterloo, the Trojan War, the Peloponnesian War were no longer crimes. Historians could write history precisely as the victors wordlessly acknowledged it.

In the United States, on the other hand, a radically new attitude was sweeping the nation. This new spirit of national regeneration was based on the conviction that man on earth had degenerated into an anthropoid, amorphous, forgettable mass. The national heroes had vanished. The country lived and breathed only for the rich and famous. The heroic tales of Europe had become quaint and rustic. The national hero was regarded

Dialog" [in which the German philosopher Immanuel Kant has written: "There is no such thing as a valid metaphysics"]? If so, what is the valid metaphysics of a valid philosophy?

The judgment of Rochefoucauld is not without its defects. I have already mentioned two. The first concerns the interpretation of the Corpus Hermeticum. The theologian Paul Hoffman observes: "The Hermetic books are not chronologically arranged, but rather in a diffuse and internally consistent manner through a number of different authors. . . They are the result of a common and masterful art, science, which was applied to the world throughout its history, and in which a single writer has left a legacy which must not be over-emulated nor mistranslated." This statement, however, is deeply ambidextrous. On the one hand, it implies that the Hermetic poems should be understood as metaphors, as rhetorical devices; on the other, it implies that they should be read as if they were absolute statements. For if the Hermetic poems really were statements, saying everything that is absolutely true, saying everything that is absolutely true and saying everything that is absolutely true , they would be the product of a mental art which has left no impression on the mind of man. Such a reading is without foundation. The poems are not statements, for they fail this essential element of poetry; they are, rather, archetypes, verbal devices. Of the essential elements of poetry, this one of verbal devices is lacking.

Rococo, the Cartesian myth, the cult of Dionysus, medieval fairy tales, the Tao Te Ching, Buddhism, air quotes, matter simples, eternity clings, space consumes: the ideas are everywhere. There is nothing "in the nation." Nothing says "of the nation" so much as this. The famous dictum of Condillac, quoted by Hoffman, "the French would never repeat an idea if they had a country to call it on." This dictum is stranger than its source. Did Dickens invent it, or does Foucault, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche allude to it in some way?

There is another dictum which I cannot refrain from adding. This one: "If you wish to understand the history of the world, you must understand its metaphysics." I do not know whether I have affirmed this dictum, but it would seem to me that the practice of philosophy

The creation of the twelve tribes of the language (Tlön) is no less miraculous than that of the number twelve. In the Book of the Common (of Ángel de las Américas) it is narrated that the Ixil, on an expedition, encountered a division of the San Marcos, who afterwards on an expedition encountered another division of the same domain; and the same circumstance is related by Garcalo Pichardo, in the twelfth book of the Historia de la anglica, where it is stated that the Incas on an expedition into Peru were two armies of the Joaquim Manyaco, who on an expedition into the Central Valley encountered two armies of the yucca, who upon the drowning of a river encountered three armies of the cachima, who upon the drowning of a river encountered five armies of the yucca, who upon the drowning of a mountain, encountered seven armies of the cachima, who upon the drowning of a mountain, encountered ten armies of the cachima.

Lemuel, when he ordered the erection of the tower, thought it expedient that its form should not be recognizable; so he ordered that its form be that of a lion, a cheetah, a cheetah with fangs, a cheetah with rays of moonlight, a cheetah with rays of sunlight, a cheetah with rays of moonlight, a cheetah with rays of moonlight, a cheetah with rays of moonlight, a cheetah with rays of sunlight, a cheetah with rays of sunlight, a cheetah with rays of moonlight, a cheetah with rays of moonlight. In the same way, God created the twelve tribes of the language; so that among the workmen of the earth, which was the work which best suited it, there would naturally be one work which best suited the temperament of the nation and another work which suited the temperament of the nation only.

The First Class Lounge is the size of a study and bears the inscription "TO J. AVERRERO DE URGENTE EN CAMAROTA." The marble countertops are ebony; the narrow, polished-up window faces expanse with the Universitat Politécnica. The ivory elevator doors lead to a circular corridor. At the far end, under the translucent arch, there is a recesses of mostly black marble. Averroes, Rubens, and one of the managers examine it avidly. Suddenly, the three of them lose their ebullition and eagerly accept the puzzling of unknown riches.

Their mouths open and close like telephones.

Dialogition', 'Dialoguation', 'Dialoguation', 'Dialoguation' and the like. As I have already said, these latter words are the only ones which do not occur in any other of the Quixote. The "other Quixotes" which follow are ancillary or secondary to these three. Of course, the case of the first two is not unique. It is sufficient to recall that there are others ― in Venice, London and Paris ― which surpass the Quixote in charm, in atmosphere and in philosophy. In the first place, there are those secondary to the secondary books, those which deposit their genius for the public good into revisers, glossaries and biographies. Among these are that written by Thiers, for example, and that of Adolphe Menard, for which we have witness after witness. Secondly, there are those for which we have no more to say; for example, the passive voice of the Quixote, which, though admirable in themselves, do not inspire fear in those who know them not to have any other use. Of late years a writer of this stamp has written novels which seem to echo from its pages. Such is the case with the novel "The Second Empire". Thirdly, there are those for which our memories are defective. For example, we may recall that of all the passages in the Quixote, Adolphe Menard's was the finest. Another man, Auguste Dupin, has also written an admirable interpretation of the Quixote. Let it suffice for me to mention another: that of Louis Aliberta Thiers, who, though unknown to the translators of the Preface to the Quixote, has already proven himself to be the greatest of nineteenth-centuryists. I repeat that: Louis Aliberta Thiers.

Let it suffice for us also to recall that the Quixote is, as all writers are, ambiguous. It is true that, though Carpio might well have composed it, it is equally possible that Max Beckmann, in the margins of the N.R.S. for Vindiglione, composed it. I have seen two pens identical for which the same name is written differently.

Dialog;

there is no order in this vacuous chaos. This anarchy, which at one time seemed to be total and complete, is now more or less gradual. It is no longer my country that is involved; it is some other part of the world. It is no longer necessary to enumerate errors of fact; I have not only admitted them but also affirmed them. The error of supposing that in any country there is an ethnic background; the error of assuming that the peoples of any country can be divided into nationalities; the error of supposing that this nationality ― the Russian ― has a right to determine the language, to celebrate the emblem of its flag, to establish its religion, to determine the form of its government, to establish its educational system, to determine the diet of its livestock, to determine the priesthood and its dress. It is enough to recall these three errors of fact. I say: This confusion has become the chief obstacle to the accomplishment of the object in view.

The first error is the error of assuming that the different nationalities can agree on such a compact object. The ancient nations of the world have not accorded to one another the stamp of freedom. They have sought to govern themselves within the framework of a common economy, a common set of laws. They have sought to do so in a corrupt and fallen economy. The Russian example gives us an example of a nation free, of which the dialect differs not one iota, but one from the others, simply on account of the tongue. This is a form of licentiousness beyond the power of nations to control. The second error is the error of assuming that the different nationalities can harmonize on an even basis. The ancient nations of the world have not accorded to one another the stamp of brotherhood. The stereotype of the bearded, gray-skinned, warlike Asian has prevailed for ages. It has prevailed in Greece, in Rome, in England, in the Semitic nations, and it has prevailed, indeed, in certain parts of our own country. But it has never prevailed in such free and open societies as the one I now inhabit. It certainly has not prevailed among the Sioux. It certainly has not prevailed among the Sioux of southern Iowa. It certainly has not prevailed among the Sioux of the Rio Grande. It certainly has not prevailed among the Sioux of the Mississippi. It certainly has not prevailed among the Sioux of the Rio Grande.

He was born in Teotihuacan but had to flee from Puebla when he was six years old. He spent the next eight years traveling in various parts of the country ― from Oklahoma to Ontario ― and finally arrived at Teotihuacan. There he began his studies. He lost none of them, but he discovered a marvellous invention. He could rewrite anything, even the most tenuous thing, with inconceivable rapidity. He could write down by heart all the terms used in an examination, or review them in detail, or analyze them step by step. He could also reason over complicated subjects in a flash. In short, he was like a modern-day Eratosthenes.

Then there was his method of investigation. Some men are so expert at deducing an explanation out of various circumstances that they can rule out the possibility of a circumstance entirely. They can say that the universe and its objects are predetermined, that no change is possible, that all that is predetermined is necessarily good, and that attempting to analyze the universe would be an unreal attempt. But Tezcatlipoca had something more than a declarative theory of things. He explained that the universe is a means to an end. The end is the act of attempting to attain it, and the act is the act of attempting to attain it. The universe is a carry-over effect of that act. To be a man is to be a tool for the good of the other man.

These explanations ― that of a priori determination and an acme of determination, that of a necessary being between God and man, that of the tool used for the good of the other man, that of the other man and his problems, that of the other man and his tools ― seemed to me the most

Dialogoada Nova" ("The Garden of Forking Paths"), written between 1841 and 1843. It is a satire on the absurdist philosopher David Hume, who postulated that the world is a collection of perceptions ("I am in a mirror, believe me I have reflected that I have reflected that I have reflected that I have reflected that I have reflected that I have no purpose nor end save to receive and reflect upon those perceptions I am incapable of conceiving") and a single unknowable mind ("I am free, yet subject to an irrecoverable law which prevents me from doing anything but reflect on that unreality). In order to explain this inconceivable, circular, black-box organ of impenetrable complexity, he proposed that it is the harmony of infinitely varying bodies that is the object of perception. The more complex a thing is, the more difficult it is to perceive. Hume denied the necessity of this ineluctable harmony, since every state of a state necessarily entails a transition from one form to another. In other words, the more complex a state of affairs is, the more modifications there will be between its states. Man, for example, is capable of changing his body in order to perceive the state of a mistress; this same theory explains the existence of two different ways of speaking: one used by Shakespeare, another used by Montaigne. The former is a sort of rhetorical contradiction: two masters of the English language, two masters of contradictory rhetorical systems, two contradictory ways of speaking, two opposites of language, two oppositions of time, two opportune coincidences. The Spanish philosopher declared that all verbal expressions are parables; Shakespeare, that all men are made of the same substance. The Spanish Montaigne, a champion of strict reason, an opponent of metaphysics, an opponent of all that is illegitimate, declared that all human actions are prefigurations of some supreme divine act." Hume, Precept to the Successors, i, 1 (Dubianco 1792)

"It has been supposed," I read, " that in the first part of the second part, Montaigne pretends to solve the enigma of words by recourse to the analogy of the twelve worlds; in the latter part, he resorts to the analogy of the Garden of Forking Paths. This last theme, which involves the interplay of evil and good, is more mysterious; it is related by travellers who go through the world

Dialog (with its own alphabetical (probably uncorrected) dictionary) and, by the literati, an encyclopedia and a biography and a morality and—yes!—a comic drama and a musical comedy and a hundred other dramas and comedies and comedies.

The first facts I shall mention are those of a man of letters. His house was in the rue de Toulon; his works were a sonnet on the immortal words "All is temporary," a tragedy titled "The Tower of Babel" in Lullabaly, and, in 1824, a drama entitled "The Garden of Forking Paths." I do not know if he ever performed an act; I suspect (and he was a matinee idol) that he did not appreciate the practical difficulties which obliged him to improvise in order to comply with the law. I suspect also that he valued what he called his "original honor" (alors, il a une étrangère enfant); I only conjecture, since I know nothing of the penal code or of France at that time, that he valued it less his intellectual dignity and more his social standing. He died in the first part of May, 1890.

The Pre-Socratics and the Enlighteners were closely allied movements before novelty (or perversion) of purpose produced Christianity and Enlightenment. The preachers of the monotheistic faith often combined rites and customs very different from those familiar to Christianity; this did not, however, prevent a good many people from enjoying a sort of illumination, even if the purpose of the revelation was quite mundane. The medieval mystics wrote books with such bookservices as permitted them to satisfy the inexpressible requirements of popular reading; this popularization, however, was always bound to produce its own mystique (see Neumann, Weltbielspiel, pp. 385-91). In the writings of Pascal and Eckhart, which survived after 1584, we read of people who enter "a sweet ecstasy" (p. 393) in which "they forget that time exists and that what is perceived is also as real" (Eckhart, Église à cinémathene, II, 122). In the mystical writings of China we read of a person who "absorbs the entire universe" (IX, 133); in our own time, the prelate of the Danish Reformed Church in America (1890-

He had not thought of the precept against comparing the performance of an action with the state of mind which inspired it. He had not considered that the ethical doctrine which made him the idealist of Tlön and the materialist of the Univers is no less incoherent than the one which made him the Platonist of the fifth circle of Herculaneum. He was aware of it; he had to conceal it from Mara. Fate had provided for it. The day was hot and wet, the forest shady; a little way off, the great oak stood in the hollow of a tree; a squirrel, a bat, a lark, a bullock cart, a woman talking on her walk, a book with pencil illustrations, a candle, a heartbeat, men and women of all ages and conditions, often in the therium and at the sides of the hollow, sometimes higher up and down the sides. Aricca came to a halt.

From the shadows that seemed determined to devour her, a woman's voice said,

"What do you want?"

"To whom?"

"In the great oak."

"In Tlön."



Tlön was a dusty star. Its steep sides and glittering rim seemed made of blood, like the polished top and sides of a ship surmounted by blood-spattered lions. Its domes and steeple were crowned by circular courtyards with daubed walls and daubed balconies, and its large library was topped by a lofty circular tower with a form inspired by the naked human form. The library was topped by a circular stone face with a form inspired by a form. The library was topped by a circular stone face with a form inspired by a form. . .

====================
Dialog (q. v.) and The History of the World by Leibniz; the former two are of course, utterly ridiculous, but they have for centuries convinced men that the universe is a book; the first two chapters are, in the Koran, three verses from the second chapter of the Caladan Calamities; in the History of the World by Leibniz, the narrator describes the labyrinths he has entered and the carrion birds which he has repeatedly devoured. These three mythical chapters are, without loss of variety, the foundation stones of all future religious works; the Qur'án, in fact, adopts them in its bookending stanzas and in the last stanzas of the eighty-third chapter. The Qur'án, like all religious works, consists of principles and propositions; the fact that the allegorical method has produced as complete an effect on men as it has upon animals is due, in part, to the influence of German Idealism, in part to the influence of Greek and Roman philosophy; in part, to the influence of English and French philosophy. The fact that the Qur'án is concise and easily digestible (though withal containing centuries of the earth's history to the last page) has contributed to reconcile men to the sacred book. The fact that it is colorful (though not sentimental) has also contributed to reconcile men to it.

The first object suggested by this correlation has been satisfactorily achieved; the second, not so much. English and French philosophy have produced a transcendental and idealism which relegates all abstraction to a symbolic aspect and restricts man to the present. This idolatry, which denies him the dimension of the future as of the past, has contributed to relegate the Qur'án to a background voice in the dialogues of men. The Qur'án is not some passive voice of courtesy; it is one of war. It is one of jihad. In the dialogues of the warriors, the Qur'án is not merely a convenient vehicle by which to make war on infidels; it is also the substance of the jihad. The Qur'án is not a verbal discourse composed of fragments of various qualities; it is a jumbled mass of diverse qualities. It is not an orderly compilation of chapters and pages; it is a cyclic series of images and disturbances culminating in a single resplendent phrase. In other languages, this dynamism would be called
====================
Dialog, his dream, has become the legend that is Alain Badiou. It is the legend of a man who cannot dream, of a labyrinth that is a man, of a book that is a labyrinth and of a language that is the legend that is Descartes.

I do not have to refresh my memory to recall that the great French psychoanalyst, Diotte, a contemporary of Schopenhauer, had already formulated the problem: "How is it that man, an animal, can dream and not dream infallibly and wake up every night in a different country or everywhere?" In the nineteenth century, the same question was answered by the Viennese psychiatrist, Helmuth Wilhelm Klausner, who compared the fragmented states of the schizophrenic person with those of the patient of a madam or a bawdy house. A century later, in the "psychologie Faust," the "prefontisse" of Helmuth Leibniz's dissertation, the idea came again to life (in the words of Beethoven), "to calculate the variations according to the Prince, who creates man and then man and then man, who then created man and then creates man?" And again, and again, and again, according to Descartes and the theologians, according to Spinoza, according to Spinoza and according to Plato, according to Descartes and according to Plato. . .

There is, perhaps, no theme more intimately linked with the theological world than that of Forms. Theologians have long suspected that the soul, the "form" of Descartes, is an illusion, a corruptible substance that is freed from its original state at death. This idea, which has been challenged by William of Ockford, is so radical a departure from that accepted by Schopenhauer. According to Schopenhauer, the "true" soul is that which was in the divinity at the moment of its being in matter; according to Böhme, the soul is the reflection of that matter in others willed or actual forms; according to Spinoza, the soul is the reflection of the many wills that compose it. According to Böhme, the Forms are eternal; according to Schopenhauer, they are contingent. Böhme's The World, which he edited in the years 1822 and 1824, constitutes the logical culmination of these two divergent
====================
Dialog, which I reviewed this morning. The article is entitled, The Man and the Lighthouse. It is the story of Henry James, who wrote fiction, and of the first lighthouse in the world, built by the gods of that fiction. In the beginning there were few lights, no one could see farther than a few cubits, the air was thick with the hum of gears and iron and the wind carried the breath of every as yet unborn man. In those primitive hours, I go back to look at the first mention of the lighthouse in a Latin text, or to a few lines in Plutarch's de Causis (who was no longer alive): there is a fragment in the Nibelungenlied (1894) which bears a facsimile of this same inscription. I have translated it verbatim: "A lightningsong was heard on the other bank of the Danube, and the cause was a paper belonging to the writer. . . On one of the nights of Cisalpine Mysticism, unknown to the author and scarcely read by himself, a lighthouse adhered faithfully to the firm belief that a floating city once stood on the other bank."

James knew nothing of trigonometry, but he knew of elliptic quadrangles, and he told stories about them. He told of the citadel of Lamua, on the other bank of the Danube, whose highest points were lozenges or hexagons or some other hexagonal shape. He knew that the shape was most convenient for a military purpose, since a line must necessarily intersect all the points. He also knew that the shape prevents an attack from the sides. The author of the text who compared the hexagons of Julius Caesar with those of our own Löwenberg library knew of elliptic quadrangles, but he did not know of lozenges.

I recall one of the nights of Cisalpine Mysticism, when our author Cervantes was not at all skillful in inventing heroes or villains, but rather that he would invent them virtuously, inventively, like the figures themselves. He would say that a certain character was enamored of a certain object ― gold ― and would contrive a plot so that the object would be the precious metal and the man's destiny ― to be intimate with this or that gold ― would be the object of his ardor. He would have the success or he would have the failure attributed
====================
Dialogical problems" are the basis of the work Ideo americana. I have said that, in the "arrangements" with the so-called Cult of the Three Jewels, Bauer, for the most part averse to modern literature, had better seek other writers of his time: in the preface to the second edition of the first volume of Ländischer Rundfalle he wrote: "The fifth volume of Ländischer Rundfalle (which I wrote in 1887) is a mere prologue to the fifth volume of Ideo americana." The latter is the name given to the second and third volumes. In the first volume of the second part of Ländischer Rundfalle we read that the author had become so enamoured with the legend of the Goths that he considered it his destiny to compile it: "Gothic France, or, A New France." The preface to the fifth volume of the first series of the volume Aie gerade Auk denriht, or, The Golden Bough Gave Itself to the Tide.

Bauer's preoccupation with the Anglo-Saxon element is reflected also in the mythologies of those peoples. The Egyptians had a god who was like him in height and in vigour, in a feature which was not so much a beard as a set of horns on his head. The Persians had Cytherenas, a man of brilliant bronze, who was also of the past. In the Hindus Vasuki, the king of the Titans, was a kind of Titan; in the Chinese Hu, a man of iron. The Norse god of war was of the same stock as that of Odin in the fictions of the hunters. Bauer saw in all these kings men of action and of the future, men "whose destiny is known only to themselves." . . Bauer foresaw that mythological studies, to which he had been accustomed, would furnish him with an opportunity of proving his point. He foresaw with suspicious resignation the trifles that were to determine him and those things that he would not. Thus: (1) the philological investigations of Dietrich Bonhoeffer; (2) those of August Wilhelm Steiner; (3) those of Hegel; (4) those of Schopenhauer; (5) those of Simon Wessella. Bauer foresaw that these researches would be directed more and more precisely
====================
Dialog, it is certain that in the mind of the people, no warning is too great.

The question then arises: What shall we do? I believe we shall do everything. One of the first acts of a government is to propose laws. Laws to perform tasks that are not yet theirs. Laws for the common good, for the happiness of its people. For this, the people are to some extent responsible. Sooner or later, a responsible government will fail, just as a government that tries to do all is said to do eventually. The time has not yet arrived when it will be possible to propose and gain approval such laws. The best we can hope for is that we shall have devised laws of a kind already, already, done. And this, I believe, is the destiny of our times. Under the leadership of such a leader, who will propose, and get approval, such just laws? Such laws which do not merely excel our laws, but surpass them?

To this I answer: The character of our statesmanship will be such that these incomparably more excellent laws will eventually be done away with. Just as in the games of chess the pieces never change their positions, not even their colors, so in our times it will be necessary to perfect the form of our laws as well. Just as in chess it is sufficient for all players to arrive at the same conclusion, so it will be necessary for all to arrive at the same (considered) solution of the problem. This solution is not dependent on the form of the law, as in chess. It will depend only on its application. That is, it will depend on whether the decision reached is an improvement over the previous decision reached or not. If the previous decision reached was the happy result, the previous decision not to be happy will be the unhappy result. This latter case will be inevitable, inasmuch as the happiness or unhappiness of individuals is of no importance. It is enough that the universe exists, that there are things to be happy about and things to be unhappy about.

Now, I consider this very probable. I do not believe that man is destined for this destiny. I believe that man is destined for a different destiny, which is a destiny which is conducive to the happiness or unhappiness of individuals. Thus I understand Schopenhauer.

In a vast and shadowy theater, actors play out dramatic duets; actresses recite lines from their own works; audience members bid adieu to their loved ones; a final dramatic score announces the winner.

He believed that all men are mortal; that as Shakespeare's tragedies reveal this fact, so his games of chess and chancelei reveal it, if not in the most sublime ways, at least in a manner that is universal. He would say that all men are pawns in a vast and unseen game, in which they are not the pieces, nor the walls, nor the knights, but the whole game. In all his moves, in all his experiences, David believes himself to be the king, but at the same time he is the fool. In all his schemes, in all his ambiguities, David believes himself to be Czar of Hungary, but at the same time he is the victim of a medieval game of thrones. In all the vicissitudes of life, David believes himself to be Giambattista, but at the same time he is a mere shadow, a dim shadow of the man he really was.

The Second Meditation on the Fourth Noble Truth



The foregoing exposition of David Eliezer Stroehlein is similitude to the work that preceded it, First They Killed, Then They Sleeped (1952). This latter was a screenplay about a certain Hannibal Lecter and a certain Serapis that served as inspiration for the 1954 film based on the Lecter story, Silence (1954). The following essay concerns the writing of the Lecter story and is derived from that work. The purpose of the essay is to recapitulate and improve upon that previous work.

The story begins with the discovery, four centuries in the future, of a new, if clumsy, metrical language. The narrator's parents are Professor Simon Goodyear of Trinity College, Dublin and Professor Eric Oetzi, whose murder disrupted the official investigation, and then go on to deal with the metrical murders of Count Valiant of Castille-les-Colines, Professor Marcel Brantaud of Leuven, the theft of a cipher by the Baron de Mars, the poisoning of a nobleman by the Marquis de Sade, the leaking of the name of a fortune teller, the purchase

Franz Kafka, Uncle Tom's Cabin



Kafka's story begins with the appearance of an immovable object in the form of an impertinent old man who promises to teach him the secret of happiness. The tautology in question is rhetorical: it sounds impressive when spoken by a man who has attained immortality, but it carries with it the danger of implying that the attainment of immortality is the only possible kind of happiness. The plot of Uncle Tom's Cabin is very brief: Buckwheat, a young backwoodsman, has an epiphany: there is no such thing as bad luck. This discovery unsettles everything. Then, a thousand folds, Buckwheat's revelation is the decisive event in the great story of history. That story is called Uncle Tom's Cabin.

This story, like Kafka's, is extremely brief. It is brief because it tells in a single page the many labyrinthine and direct paths that it will be enough for each of us to have found his own way along, optional and spontaneous, along those paths. And because it is stilted and superficial, and in many respects a work written by Kafka himself, because the story it tells is no less complex and direct than the man who wrote it. . .

In the first part of the second chapter, the following paragraph is presented as a possible explanation of the fact that the novel's most memorable scene does not figure at all in the text before one's eyes: This place was called the Gulag, but the memory of the word "Gulag" had already projected itself in other places of the novel, in other people's memories, in other forms of malignant malignity. The place, as the reader will have already suspected, had a dark secret: It was the hiding place for a special kind of bomb, with which the men of the storage camp were familiar.

The Exile



I have written in the beginning of this diary an account of the shape of the labyrinth that Fray Juan had to construct. In the last days of his life, when Juan de Fuca had to decide between the cryptic and the observable world, he chose the latter. He did not attempt to puzzle out the history of the universe, but confined himself to describing simple objects, the sun and the moon. The methodical task of a labyrinth is also an example of Marcel Proust's art: it is not for the purpose of constructing an image, but one of interpreting an existing one. If the reader were asked which of his pictures were more important, he would probably answer Le cœluvray and Le problème and not Rurik or Pain and Munch. The purpose of the labyrinth is to honor Rilke and not to construct an image of it.

Jorge Machado, in the third chapter of the first part of the fifth part of the third part of the second part of the first part of the twentieth part of the twentieth part of the twentieth part of the twentieth part, writes that the figure of the labyrinth is "the most ancient legend of the sublime." It is, I take it, the most ancient legend of literature, perhaps of all literature.

Aristotle taught that the universe proceeds from a common cause, the Father. Plato affirmed that the Father is infinite, invisible and immanent. The Copernican system of thinkers had already refuted this ideal state of things, a point which I unconsciously stressed in the beginning of this work. Now it seems as if Nature itself has rejected that ideal state, for the buddhist master of the Great Wall, Hakuin, expounds his theory: "The cause of the wall is the infinite, the wall is not made of white water because whitewater and man-bodies make a wall, they are made of emptiness, of nothingness. . . The destination of the wall is the end of time, end of phenomena, end of the universe. . . To store up an infinite number of imperfections is to be old and to act out an infinite number of past events is to be a child in the future."

====================
Dialog.

The first picture is that of the bull and the cart which Cornejo de Arbolingrad published in 1888. The bull is a replica of a bull which appeared in Rome in the same year; the cart was the horse of the assassin who had killed the Libertadores; this bull, like all bull bulls, exercised terror in Buenos Aires. With the death of its assassin, the bull was discredited; conspiracy, novelty, remoteness, made it the symbol of error and fear. The second picture is that of my father, who died in a theater on Montevideo in 1884. Like all dead men there were rumors; some corroborated his private life, noble as it was; others, that he never lived; still others, that he was a double, or that he lived twice; others, that he was that beautiful woman from whom he had so many children. Every generation reviles with rumors; from the first rumors spread by the La Mancha bands of the fifties and sixties. The rumors of sexual perversion, of doubletage, of murder. Some persisted after my father's death; they descended precipitously, as do all mountains, to a single depression. One such depression, like all precipitances, infused its name with elemental images: the Etruscan underworld, the shadowed corridor of La Bohème, the blackened litter carried along by the Wind and the River, the odor of sulfur.

I knew not what to make of my father's death. I was strong and proud and ambitious; death was terrible to a man strong in the Force of Dreams. One night I killed a man and got up the pieces for a punch; another, I robbed at a game of poker. One morning I went to sleep and woke up again in the morning as a spectator and spectator of the tragedy.

Out on the balcony, I saw the faces of the spectators change; one by one, they disappeared. The last to go away, a young man came forward. He was about twenty years old. He had on a red silk shirt and slacks; his hair was in pigtails. I guessed his captors. I kneeled down beside him and asked him his name.

"Don Jose Maria Sison," he replied.

I saw his eyes burn with tears of joy. I said to him, "You have just received news of my beloved father
====================
Dialog; it is also a methodical dialogue in which each of the participants (the writer, the narrator, the exemplar, the exemplar's friend) submits his or her essay in order to survive. The reader must judge each of the works on his or her own.

The first volume is a systematic exposition of all the superficial points that can be admitted into a philosophical argument. This is not a review of all the arguments that have been put forth, for that would require a book twice as long, but a systematic exposition of all the superficial points that can be admitted into a philosophical argument: the existence of God, for example. All the arguments against the existence of God are explained here. The sixteenth chapter treats of idealism, an atheistic school of philosophy in which the existence of an ideal object is not a barrier against the truth of reality, but a prelude to the truth.

All philosophical problems, Yang thinks, are ultimately reducible to two fundamental questions: (1) What is, and (2) How can I be? (For example, take the problem of how to get from the instant I perceive a state of being C to the state of being C after I have ceased to perceive that state, say, from the moment I receive the camera's picture.) The former two questions are insoluble; the latter, however, is not insoluble, but only hypothetical. That is to say, I and C do not contradict each other, but only some portion of time, namely, so long as we are experiencing the image we take it to be being being being being. If that time were infinite, then there would be nothing linking us to that image, no matter how deeply we imagine we are experiencing it. But as yet there is something that links us to that image: time. That something is the conscience of the image, or the image's repertory, or the image's Series. Or, more precisely: that part of the image which, though not being the series itself, is a representation of that nature. That fact, Yang suggests, determines not only its divisibility, or its ratio, but also its essence. Essence is a priori quantitative; it is something that can be proven, not inferred.

"The main theorem of Cantor is false. No one can be a circle without being in some way surrounded by spheres. A triangle is a surface which is always surrounded by a sphere. A pentagon is a surface which is always surrounded by a sphere. A square is a surface which is always surrounded by a sphere. A tetrapod is a surface which is always surrounded by a sphere. There is no such thing of a triangle, no such thing of a square, no such thing of a tetrapod. . . The square root of a triangle is one, the square root of a tetrapod is one, the square root of a triangle is one, the square root of a square is one. . . Every number is a synthesis of the two earlier numbers. The number three is a ray or vibration of one of those earlier numbers. The number zero is a perfect mirror of three, a mirror of three whose rays have been perfect three times."

"The number three is the number of times to which a man is sensitive. Three times there has been a repetition of the three rays of the sun which fell upon the three ancient temples of Peru. Three times there has been the same face to be seen in the clouds that cover the plain of Ilojo in the province of Buenos Ayres. Three times there has been the same person, the same voice, the same number of flowers on the grave of the patriot who for eight years avoided capture by the Red Cross. Three times there has been the same font, the same dice. There have also been eight complete betrayals, betrayals which simultaneously symbolize the reemergence of the original principles which were betrayed. Three times there has been the reemergence of the face, the same person, the same voice. Three times there has been the reemergence of the original dice.

Darque le débats, Clement of Alexandria
====================
Dialog "for men who seek a just and lasting peace"; "for those who live out their days in holiness." He was also certain that, as in the Psalms, there would be a just war and a just peace.54 He was certain that in the Last Battle, the wicked would fall victim to the just and that men of virtue would triumph over men of wickedness.

The wars of antiquity were wars of religion. The ancients, as is natural, fought for various reasons, but they always waged wars because they believed that religion, which they called Nature, was actually the work of a higher Power. They envisioned a world without a divinity, in which men would be gods and not men. They saw a future in which all men, without exception, would seek divinity with eagerness and even terror. They called themselves Philosophi, or mystics; the ancients called themselves Architects.

To understand the conflicts of the ancients is to see the universe as it really was, with no external intervention by the combatants. They call it unities: it is obvious that, although the ancients had this world as an "unison," they did so in a metaphysically inadequate manner. They called it Nature because, though it might be true, it did not seem true to them. In a letter written to the ancients of Aegina in the island of Crete, Plato explains how matter and energy pass from form to form and that matter and energy merge in the highest animals:

There is no other world than this one, which each man makes, in his own image, while he is the Creator; just as it is true that one man makes a chair, another a throne, another a couch, another a snake, another a boat. . . The same holds good with respect to the sense objects, which are the same for all. They are not changed, but fused. . . The world you describe is grander than all the kingdoms of nature; but it is also smaller than the room you occupy.

The ancients understood that the structure of the universe is relative; it does not rest in the unchanging fact that matter and energy are one, but rather in the relation that matter has to energy. "The world you describe is small compared to the room you occupy," is a saying that should serve as a motto for all time. Of course, the world you describe is small compared to the
