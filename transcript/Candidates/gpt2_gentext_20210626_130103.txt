====================
Latency are the two "least troublesome" of qualities.

The second kind is, I take it, the most pertinent to the problems I have in view: that is to say, they are those qualities which best correspond with that state of mind which is essential to the performance of the civic duty incumbent upon a king or a representative of a king. It is these qualities: beneficence, prudence, self-restraint, self-justifiability, self-justification.

These four qualities are found in the behavioral and in the literary sketches of the period. It is fitting that we should record them in these sketches because they best correspond with the literary traits of that period.

To see how, consider the following fictional sketch: A is walking along in the garden. He comes across a clock. A turns the second hand toward zero. Daylight has come.

He comes across a clock. A turns the second hand toward zero. Daylight has come.

He comes across a clock. A turns the second hand toward zero.

He comes across a clock. A turns the second hand toward zero.

He comes across a clock. A comes across the garden.

He comes across the garden.

He comes across the garden.

He comes across the garden.

He comes across the garden.

The third kind of fictional sketch is of less moment importance than the second, but it is of interest nonetheless.

It is typical of the mental state of the sketch's reader that he does not even have to turn his head to look at it; his eyes are directed immediately and uninterruptedly to the ninety-nine places on the clock that something has happened, and not one of them has anything to do with what is happening on the page. . . In this mental stupor, a leopard usually stops and considers its shoes.

For example: There it is: I have just stated the case against Dr. Opperman, who had maintained that homosexuality is a mental disorder of the five senses. Dr. Opperman had been tried, I say convicted; I have just spoken of a sentence of punishment. Opperman had claimed a privilege which the five advocates of a depraved interpretation of the fifth feature of humanity enjoyed: the right to cast a spell on the criminally insane. Opperman's lawyer had invoked this privilege; Opperman had answered in the affirmative; Opperman had invoked the
====================
Latency is a feature not of our intelligence, but of our system. We have here a representation of mental events, but they are not reflected back to the actor in terms which are analogous to those which he would normally use. The most simple and direct means of improving this homogeneous state is time: a system of symbolic delays, of predetermined intervals of time, not only by means of arithmetic, but also by analogy with the periodic acts of animals. In the literature of differential geometry, differential time, are the ablest and most easily understood expressions that can be found.

The above exposition of the law of diminishing returns might seem a diminution, a blot on the otherwise infinite canvas of symbolic complexity. But consider for a moment another composition: a system of signs, all of which has a definite relationship to some fact or other. The fact that the signs may or may not coincide does not diminish the significance of this fact, because the relationship may be known (perhaps beforehand, perhaps after), since it is implied in the combinations. The same thing happens here: the phrases "the sun rises in the west" and "the west wind blows" have a similar significance, since they are equivalent to "the sun rams a west wind" and "the west wind blows." The same is true of so many other phrases: it is enough to study the symbolic relationships of the elements to notice them, and to deduce many secondary consequences from them.

Composition is another form of meaning. If I compose a sonnet from the Iliad, I have conveyed to the ear of the spectator the narrative of a war, or of the generation of the King, which is implicit in the text itself. The same thing happens here: the mutually varying relationship of ideas expressed by the two terms "the sun rises in the west" and "the west wind blows." The reader will perceive that they do not determine the poem, but modify and subvert it. The meaning I have tried to compose, the one intended the different texts give rise to. I have also pretendered here the gods and thespians of olden Iliad, and also the vain preachers of the cult of the Eye of Horus. I have not transcribed the Iliad or the battle of Manzikert, because I believe that reading these things would be a sin, a blasphemous act, like reading the Bible. I have, instead, written a
====================
Latency on the part of the police was abominable. The constables and the horses and the petty criminals and the women and the madmen who roamed the streets were an affront to the police state. The bad luck started early. A drunkard who stabbed me to death in my bed one night was stopped by a policewoman and sentenced to prison; I was waiting for him in the courtyard when the deed was done. I believe I am not the only person who felt the dread that prison would be our palace, with its servants and its curious rules and its curious music.

The police state was dawning on me, and I went out to look for lanterns and water from the hatcheries. I found none on the second floor. To the north, the sun had reached its setting phase. The moon, the brightest object in the sky, had lost its lustre. At the harbor, the wind shifted abruptly, and with it, the wind for the first time in three days. I heard the water for the first time, the salty sound of it on a dock, and I took this new and terrible fact with me. I decided to look for my brother.

I began to weep openly. In the distance, the billets de Gaulle and the Seine filled up with men on horseback; suddenly, from the dimness of a sitting room, I caught a glimpse of a horseman riding past in a plane of translucent light. It was the face of my brother.

			“There is,” Quentin said. “Look at that. That’s everything. There is something in all this poverty and madness and despair, and in all that stuffs trying to tell me something. I ought’ve known it was going to hurt. But that is what suffering is: it proves you are human.”

			He wasn’t sure what that thing was, but he knew that it wasn’t anything like what Betsy had said it was. But hell, who was? Quentin thought, maybe he would give it a shot. Maybe he would try to’t.

====================
Latency is the only form of time that does not exist. A man has not been in this world, he has not been in the past, present and past. He has only been, is, and will be." [Marx, Grundrisse, chapter twelve]

"The future is the perception of things yet to come; the past, the recognition of things that have happened; the present, the distinction between things that have happened and things that have not. A perception of the future is like a blind man walking into a room where there is a light; a perception of the past is like an elephant in a grove of acacia; a perception of the present is like a still unborn elephant in a still unborn tree. The present is the unity of being with the Unity; the Illusion is the disruption of this unity." [Dostoyevsky, Letter to a Friend, 1936, page ninety-nine]

"The past, like a computer screen, is verbal; the present, like a melody in a lyre; the imagined world, the cyborg." [Nikolai Filatov, Botvinnik, page ninety-one]

"To be and not be is the question; the present, like the perfection of a triangle; theiffin, like the inspiration of a name." [Paul Feyerabend, Narrative of a Dream, page ninety-two]

"If I am not a thing, if I am not the future, what am I? If I am the future, how come I am alone in the future? If I am the future, how come I am inquisitive? If I am inquisitive, where is the future in my dreams? If dreams are clues, what is the future in them? If the idea of time is lost, what chance does it have of remembering it? If the chance does not remember it, how can I act? Otherwise the idea of time cannot be the same as that of dreaming?" [George Santayana, Farach, page ninety-three]

"What is future and the nightmare ? A future is a thing that has happened; a nightmare is the recognition of the fact that the thing has happened. A future is a verbal statement; a nightmare is an actual occurrence." [George Barrett, line two]

Latency was a factor too. She’d planned on going through with it, but the last time she checked that wasn’t her discipline.

			“Really, it’s not like we have an army of Dursleys to worry about here. We’re a small, tightly knit family, and we spend a lot of time out in the country. We’re not in the thick of it, but we’re not completely behind it either. We’re not going to overrun their kingdom with magical might just because we could use a lift to get there.”

			“I see that your passport is still valid,” Josh said. “All right. We’re going to need your help with something, but first we’re going to need your help figuring out how your magic works.”

			“All right, all right.” She did look a little taken with herself, like she was begging a question. “There has to be a guidebook that tells us everything we need to know about magic, right?”

			“There should be. And it’s free.”

			The meeting with the witch ended that second Bill Clinton’s reverie, which Quentin hadn’t even heard until now. It was like he’d never sat through it in the first place.

			When they returned to the beanbag, juggling a few comic books in front of it, Quentin and Plum sat on separate couches. Plum got the bed.

			'Cause this is what socializing is for, hmm? Figuring it out is when you can finally spend all that time staring at your phone? Well, maybe then. Figuring it out starts a problem. Sounds like a good plan.

			Hang on, this isn’t what I’m talking about here. This is more like...'Cause there was a time when I actually believed in Fillory. I thought it was a pretty neat place. I loved it. I hated it. But I also believed in it. In the end I got to where I was, and I know I will again. And I swear it on everything I’ve lost and everything I’ve gained, because if not now
====================
Latency, I think, would be an appropriate adjective. The book appears to have been written in a short time, perhaps two or three days. The transport was by car, but the arranging and the printing took up the bulk of an afternoon. The book is a series of very brief but very elaborate chapters, each one a chapter in a different book. Each chapter ends with a phrase taken directlyout of Homer's Iliad. . . I do not know how many of the characters in this manuscript the ancients used; I know that there are many others which the literati of all countries have created. . . The idea of a secret compilation seems absurd to me. If a secret code be involved, that code must be of a cyclic character, able to be broken and then renewed indefinitely. If the Plancius is a secret encyclopedia, who compiled it?

In my days as a Tlön student I once obtained from a former student the manuscript of a poem which has since been destroyed. In it was represented the grave perdition of Ovid, in whose pages the dead emperor was represented as sinking under the weight of the libations prepared for him. This destructive poem, I recall, had been composed by Shakespeare or Laplace. Would it not be poetic to reconstruct the action of this terrible union, this fabrication of Laplace, so that Laplace might reap the benefits of the union, and I, as the doomed Shakespeare, but so that Shakespeare might reap the benefits of the poem, and I, as I, perhaps, am Shakespeare, the poet? I ask this because it is difficult to decipher in any language the simple line, "I was I, I was I, I lived and died a single life," the life of a senseless and brief man, and the life of a prince who, bereaved of his father and the empire he so dearly loved, thought himself entitled to the secret name of God. I once received the book in token of my sincere regret at having lived a life of perdition; I now know that the poem was written by a sorcerer, to the end that divine death which the ancients so magnifi ed.

In the year 1928 I was elected president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. The purpose of this episcopal prerogative was not only to maximise the utility of my papacy's supposed spiritual resources, but also to give the Union's most zealous activists a voice in the approving

Latency. You can't just pop it in—it has to be goosed down to where it will fit in. We did an exercise where we had the dude sitting there for 20 minutes, and then we took him off for 20 minutes, and then he came on again for another 20 minutes, and then he came on again for another 20 minutes. It was pretty hilarious.

The other thing that really stood out to me about you guys is how willing you guys are to compromise your craft. I know you guys have a lot of discipline. I know you guys have a lot of work permits. I worked with you guys for a long time, and I only just recently got around to checking your e-mails. I bet those e-mails are pretty important to you too.

No, we weren’t. And no, we’re not as busy as we think we are. I think our biggest challenge has been keeping our appetites under wraps. I think our biggest secret is gonna surprise us. And by surprise I don’t just mean the movie. I mean the movie when we’ll all see it.

When we found out we were getting an movie role, we were like, man, that’s cool, we’re gonna go for it. But then we went for it and went for it and gone and gone and gone. We were like, man, we really want to do Wonder Woman. Then we went and did it and it was so fucking terrible. And then we did it again and it was like what the fuck and then we went and did it on Netflix and it was like dammit don’t do that. And then we did it at the box office and that must have been when we went completely insane.

I know what you guys are thinking: dude, you didn’t do anything crazy there. Well, no, it didn’t. But girl, do I feel like I’ve been sleeping with a whole new set of guys these past couple of weeks. Do you know what my swing rate is these days? Low. I mean, I’ve got some big-name guys who are likealready familiar with my house, but they’ve been out for a ride.

Latency = 2; } } }

At this point you will probably cry out: "But we have macros, we don’t have that problem!" And you are absolutely correct: we do have macros, and we have a macro grammar, and we have a macro expansion grammar, and we have a macro substitution grammar. But I feel like we should stop there.

Let’s imagine we’re not at a computer, but four people sitting around a table. We have an sentence, an adjective, a noun, an adverb, and a verb. A macro is waiting to happen:

A pronoun binds the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject.



A macro defines a verb, then defines a clause, then defines a root, then defines a prefix, then defines a preposition, then defines a colative case, then defines a modifying adverb, then defines a vocative case.



A vocative case, a vocative case. A case like that you’d hard-coded into your brain if you did not already.





A case like that waiting to happen. A case like that you’d coded right into the software in the first place.




A vocative case. A case like that you’d coded right into the software in the first place.

====================
Latency is essential. The explicit phrases, the rhythmical movement, do not exhaust the book; the reader must labor under a presumption that the novel is nothing more than a series of accidental phrases and movements, like that of the blind beggar who sells newspapers. The admirable thing is that the reader not only tolerated this appearance of random chance, but was seduced by its exact parallels in the most authentic artists. Dandy included this comparison with his famous magazine, the Trocadéro: "The greatest pleasure of life is the knowledge that one's life exists."

The book then begins to tell us a great deal about itself. Its first chapters are almost identical with those of Schopenhauer's first: "Man is my pet horse, more dear to me than a daughter. I have cared for it as my own and I will care for it as my own. . . My dog, my beloved, my dearest love." These words, written in 1819, formed the basis for the famous book Teil IKR über alles; the anonymous author associated themachiarten adventures with fantastic horses and madmen. The latter effect was achieved by means of smoke and mirrors. In the anonymous third chapter of the beginning there is a description of the I-hitokiri, a technique which is still applied to the ware fronts of present-day Japan: "At the back of the horseshoe-shaped sword were the words I I I I sat down on the spot where the meeting had been held and where the first explosion occurred. There was a severe burn on the back of my hand. This fact made me feel very uncomfortable. Two things made me feel comfortable: the fact that my hand would not hurt it could be amputated at any moment, and that my hand, which was totally new, was so very hard." In the fourth chapter, which is partially devoted to the ghost story, there is another such feeling: "Ghosts are very real. You can practically hear their voices in the room. You cannot hear their music, but they are always telling you something, or already had been, which you will not get out of your mind or have to forget. You can even see them in action. You saw an apparition of Madame Bovary in the revolving mirror." The spirit world is described in full: "The ceiling is made of a translucent crystal, or musé, called the I-hollow. Through it all there
====================
Latency is the enemy of story. An endless chant, a clangorous crash, a barking pack of wolves, a rumbling wind, a source of noise unsuspected by all, an invisible adversary steps in and challenges us; we cannot but respond with all our might. We must master this enemy or face his diabolical power. Without this power, what is story made of? Story is verse or music, architecture or literature, or, if you will, blanks or letters. If these alternatives are to exist, the labyrinth must be possible. Blanks and letters are for vagabonds."

All this Mundus uttered in the shade of the trees, in the caverns of his stomach, in the chilly streets and at the back of the lorries, in the narrow alleys and at the top of the hills. His fingers danced on the indicator dial; fever and fatigue took precedence over invention and death followed fever and fatigue. He slept five nights and dreamed five nights and never came out of the dreamer's house until dawn. On the sixth and last night he dreamed that he was at rest and happy. There was no one and he was alone. The landscape was simple and public, the people were present but the quarrel was private and distant and he did not dream anyone walking toward the house with a gun. He saw a garden and a meadow; there was no one else in the garden; there was a lake whose water was cold; the moon hung there like a satellite of the earth. A thundercloud darkened the sky. A man was reading a poem. The man did not know what was written there; he seemed to perceive that the poem was something terrible. There was a pool table; the man did not know if the man who sat there with a gun and his purpose to learn the meaning of a poem was worthy of anything more. The man dreamt that he was a hunting or bathing fellow who knew how to please the earth or the water. The man dreamt that he was going to have a drink with somebody. The drink was unknown to the other. The man dreamt that he was reading a poem. The poem was unknown to the man.

The man dreamed that he read in a book that those who have not tasted death, nor felt the shock of it, have tasted and have enjoyed the enjoyment of another's shock. He dreamt that he tried to please or please again. He dreamt that he (
====================
Latency is a virtue. On the other hand, the philosopher has the advantage of not having to laboriously perfect his language, which is another facet of his virtue.

The next chapter will deal with the idea of the self which appears in the eleventh chapter and in the fourth.

Self-consciousness is the knowledge that you are different from those who do not perceive it. It is not a feeling but a perception. The world is the knowledge that you will not be different from it. It is not a tree, not a man, not a bird, not a cloud. The world is the tree which sees the world.

Selfhood is the state of being capable of love. It is not a private state, but a state of the soul. It is not a state of the will, but a state of the heart. It is not a mere formalism, but a real realization.

All this selfhood implies is that of an eternal plan or grand design, which all beings who can perceive it ― the tree, the man, the night, the night-bird, the night-form ― can grasp and perceive. But since the tree, the man, the night, the bird, the cloud, do not perceive it, because they are not forms, but only abstractions (not even material objects) perceived by the tree, the night, the bird, the cloud.

The third and last chapter deals with the problem of time. It will be seen that the first three problems do not refer to the generation of things, but to the problem of generating those things.

The fourth problem asks: "How do you become one of the things?"

The fifth problem says: "How do you produce things out of nothing?"

These questions and others like them ask us this basic and benignant question: Are you (the maker) one of the things? Are you (the producer) one of the things? Do you answer 'yes' to these simple questions and you are one of the things. Do you see that all things have made you, all things want to make you, all things can make you, all things because of your inaccessibility and because of your being one of them?

Latency is a virtue in a magician. In the world I know, there is no second chance. Magic is a subterranean duty. I am here because somebody, somewhere, wants to see me, wants to know me, wants to imprison me. To escape from that person, from that prison, I must escape from my mirror. I have spent centuries, I am of Middle Eastern stock, my name is a bit of a crock, so I feel no enmity toward the Bedouins, Middle Eastern or Not Middle Eastern. Therefore, I feel no enmity toward my reflection in the mirror. I seek safety in that safety which is the mirror. Look, there is a boy in the mirror; that is proof that I am not what I seem."



One of the most striking features of Ibn-Sharaf's life is his complete and complete forgetfulness. He never writes backwards or cares what people think he will write anything that comes to him and then does nothing else. In his own writings it is written that he was a freedman, but very rarely does he open a book and find it to be mysteriously titled. It was during one such visit that he discovered, rather surpriseingly, that the volume had already been duly published five years before in two languages. He opened it, was stricken with astonishment, and then with elation. He found the foreword in one language and the conclusion in the other. He returned to the room where the volumes were kept and lit a cigarette. Suddenly he realized that he had forgotten to take off his shoes. He took off his sandals, putting his soles in his outstretched right hand. The smooth black leather was the preferred type, though in some readers the choice would have been khaki. He looked around the room: all the books there were valid, though a few hadn’t been officially recognized as belonging to him. A few lampposts remained, but they seemed almost defenseless against the elements. Slowly and deliberately, slowly and precisely, he set the book down and turned the page. From the page he studied the illustrations in the book's first edition. On acid, slowly and with the fear of nausea, he read that the book was the work of a rabbi from Breslau, a century ago. He had translated it from the Breslau Sephardic, a dialect of Spanish originally written by Jews fleeing the czarist empire, and then

			Right. So far it was going pretty well out of the gate, but there were a couple of things that needed doing up in the field too. Mostly just stuff to do, like not to say anything goodbyes to Quentin and not to Stoppard and not to Betsy and not to the giant bald-headed troll that bit them so good their faces looked like they’d been frozen in ice. And there was still a whole lotta healing. Puerto Rico.

			They left the hot tub and walked through the dense undergrowth, the sun tangling through the leaves and the rainwater soaking their clothes, until they came to a big rock with a narrow stone arch over it. It was a long way from any of the flats they’d been on, but Quentin was really starting to like Fillory, way more than he liked explaining it to his parents. It was a lovely place, even more so than he thought it would be. It had a nice, peaceful feel to it, and the occasional lark or two of interest, but mostly it was just a lovely place to grow up. It had a lot of big, wonderful things going for it, too, like a big, bountiful sweet spot in between the real world and the magical. Fillory was pretty much perfect.

			And it had a new god.

			Quentin looked at his little map again. There was a new form added to the gods of Fillory, a form that definitely would not be Gluttony. It was a sad discovery, a pleasant afterthought, but a discovery nonetheless. He stared at it for a long time, thinking about what it would take
====================
Latency in the legal system is another issue. I understand that the civilian courts in many cities do not always give effect to the decrees of the higher courts. . . Many misunderstandings arise out of this. For example, there is a notion that if the sentence is void a new trial is impossible; this is absurd on several points. The fact that men sometimes face death row without any hope of being tried again does not tend to prove that a new trial is impossible. Nor is it surprising that injustice should creep in, when it has the stamp of justice. The defendant is innocent until proven guilty; the State should endeavor to prove him innocent until and unless and until and until and unless.

There is another species of fallacy. The phrase "inhabited by ... aliens" omits the fact that all aliens are mentioned in the statute and that all inhabitants of the southern districts are aliens as well. It omits the fact that the southern districts are also "inhabited" by beastly beasts, which is equally true. It also omits the fact that the southern and northern districts are, on two separate maps, the same country, the same world. It also omits (but here the reader will have already noticed) the fact that the southern and northern maps are not nearly so identical as the famous Prisma Alta form sublunal latinam.8 Nor is it surprising that the fiction of such minute differences should be enough to confuse the most conscientious reader, who would plumb the recesses of each other's earth and sea, bury secrets that are seasons or zones, or that maze the horn of Comte, is enough to deceive him.

In summary, the novel is a labyrinth, the reader an adept. The reader is protected against this labyrinth by making of the labyrinthic world of the novels images which, though unreal, nevertheless serve to bridge the voids between the worlds. This art is called adoration and is attributed to the Byzantine emperor Justinian I.9 It is sheer virtuosity, like looking into a mirror without a single imperfection. It is also claimed by Nietzsche and Schopenhauer.10 Both writers have mystics who transit through the labyrinths of their worlds. Both writers have worlds whose gods are not only unreal but also impostors. One god is a bull and the other a bulldog. One god is a bull and another an Indian lion. One god is ideal and the other another ideal

			“I think we found something,” he says. “Something that will last. I don’t know if it’s magic or what, but Something held out a hand to her and she took it. I’m guessing it was gratitude. I don’t know. It must be substantial business.”

The Kingdom of God is in the Misty Mountains



Written in the land of Heika and Brija



Foreword



This article is based on the chapter from the book La belle organisme (1874) by Mary Daly. She had the distinct distinction of being the first woman writer of science-fiction, which at that time was a relatively new quality. Her stories, which abound in fantastic elements, nevertheless accord remarkably well
====================
Latency. By way of contrast the total absence of interest or thought in the last scene of Hamlet is most striking. What did the hero of that tragedy not care to know? What unoccupied him? The scene's title card announces the presence of another terrific tragedy, this one told in the names of Hector and Paula.

The world is full of fantastic worlds; what is unexpected and singular in the one before us is revealed in the next. The Tetragrammaton is a tool for secret thought; it is language without gloss or gloss without thought. The Cabalists deceive us with Latin to invent a language, but our thought will be Latin, not Egyptian or Greek. The Tetragrammaton is the secret formula of the Cabalists, the secret name of their god. I have annotated it in this book, to signify that fact that the Cabalists intentionally omitted: the majority of mankind, like the Jews of yore, worships one god, and this god is God. The other gods are only loosely associated with celestials; Horus (Hades), Semiramis (Semiramis the Confused), Tiamat (The Sea of Tears), Set (The Ten Commandments), Asmodeus (The Arc of the Moon), Umber (The Dragon of August). The remaining four gods are rarely invoked: Asclepius, Dionysius, Uriel and Pluto.

The majority of mankind worships only one god: God.

Worship of any god but God is superstition; worship of any other god but God is worship.

The practice of divining the signs and tokens of the times from the deities of one's ancestors is nothing new; the difference is that, nowadays, most people do not bother to do it.

Few people in all the civilized lands know that from the beginning of time to-day existed two very ancient destinies, one for Europe, one for the forbearing Africa; few people in all the civilized lands know that these two deserts, one on the right and the other on the left, gave us King Henry V and King James I; few people in all the civilized lands know that these two frontiers, two axes and two swords, signified nothing more than the uniform frontiers of a war that lasted three centuries and made of earth and two skies; few people in all the civilized lands know that these symbols, these primitive elements,

Latency is the enemy of beauty. Let us not be daunted by the thought of a few lines of text and by the inconvenience of knowing whether these lines will be displayed before the public or secret audiences of a future state. Two or ten thousand pages of obscure characters is a vast amount of text. Each word typed on this page will be indivisible; words written by hand on paper, with their many possible permutations, will have no possibility of variation. The Brakebills Library is the size of a room and the handwriting is uniform. To preserve it is to form an indefinite impressionistic memory, which is why, centuries from now, it will be necessary to preserve that imprint which maintained that memory.







The Camera



The first impression of Tlön is one of brilliant and tranquil color. The Hapsburg tongue, with which it shares no previous nucleus, has been totally obliterated; the differences you now trace between the scripts of Tlön and those of your own countries are merely cosmetic: the script of Tlön is the same as the one you use in your own, and the differences between our letters and those of other countries are inconsequential. From the beginning you have noticed that the scripts of your countries are radically different; to bypass this difference you have first obliterated it; later you have created a script identical in some ways to the one you left out. Owing to this obliteration you have also created a difference. What is your script? I know it: that of the Americans. What is your language? Our language. What is the emblem of your republic? A star. What is the emblem of another? A crown. What is the emblem of your globe? A triangle. What is its revolution? The hour. What is the emblem of your minute hand? A crown. What is the emblem of another? A foot. What is the emblem of another? A limb. What is the emblem of your space? A triangle. What is the emblem of another? A triangle. What is the emblem of another? A triangle.

Latency was the enemy of the drama which the authors of the florin could not understand. They sent for the most able antiquaries, who, in order to understand the language, had recast the terms "monument" and "eyewitness" in terms quite foreign to the people and quite unexpected of the language. They could not explain what the people saw or heard, or why they thought they saw it and thought they saw it. In the end, the florins gave up and went about their business as if the florins of olden times had nothing to say to say about the mysterious monuments and ancient florins.

Suddenly, a proposal struck me. I remember the hours that followed it. It was summer 1905. I was in the province of Lorraine, and I was in the service of General de Tetric. (Gentlemen, I am going to speak of you now as the "service of General.") I understood him. He asked me to come to his office, which was located in the very topmost level. The reason was clear to me, as I raised my voice. I said: "I am coming to ask, with all sincerity, your candid assistance in the investigation of, one of the most puzzling and astonishing operations imaginable: the construction of a vast iron sky."

General de Tetric listened to me with an air of profound astonishment and then with a certain hurt not unlike that of a speaker who, having been stumped, demands the help of someone who has not been there, and does not understand what the other is saying. Perhaps he believed that I had made a legitimate offer ― albeit an unreasonable one ― of my services, not to mention that of the entire army, to assemble witnesses who would affirm, by scientific and artistic means unachievable before, him, the iron sky, to erect and maintain in order a tree twelve meters across, eight meters high and eight meters thick, consisting of concentric rings of iron equal in area to the hexagons, a single square centinary of iron, a single square centinary of iron, a single square centinary of iron, a single centinary of iron, a penny.

Without taking his glass out of his neck pocket, he struck two figures of inch diameter in the temples with one blow. One of them dropped his right fist, the other his left. The first fist clanged down without ceremony, the second did not land

, best known for his graphic novel series,, has died. The cause was pancreatic cancer , according to his publicist. The comic won the World Fantasy Award for best novel four years in a row and was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize twice. He was also shortlisted for the Hugo and the BAFTA . In 2004, he was honoured with an honorary doctorate from Imperial College, London. A native of Hackney, London, Isaac Asimov grew up amid simple, unpretentious houses dotted with odd little shops and cottages. Isaac was always ready with his responses to philosophical and theological questions. "What is the universe, exactly?" he would ask; "who built it, and why?"; "what is life, exactly, but speed and a form?"; "if life is a divine process, how came we to be here as we are here?" (These were the rhetorical styles of Bernard Williams, his close collaborator and heir apparent.) Isaac was a child of the nineteen-fifties, a generation which, like its forerunners, was suspicious of technology and traditional values. It is no exaggeration to state that the majority of its members identified with or had roots in the radical left-wing parties of Europe and the United States of yore. Indeed, it is
====================
Latency and randomness are what characterise the human condition, why should we believe that those two things, the absence of design, are a sufficient reason for the rejection of a theory? The theory itself is not sufficient if we examine it within the framework of a divine design.

We have seen that the design of the universe is perfect information. If every man on earth were so equipped, so that he were able to perceive and classify the successive states of his environment, information is an experience: the individual would not need a brain. But the perception of the states of the environment (in which each man acts independently of his environment) is a mental state: the individual would need a separate mental state for each individual state. Each individual mental state is called a character: each character is called a symbol. Each symbol is a node in a data structure, which would have branching paths analogous to those of the Internet. Each path corresponds to a letter in the language the letter occurs in: these letters would be given a corresponding name on the Internet. The Internet would be a language, but the letters would be symbols. Each symbol would have life of its own, bearing witness to temporal relations as well as to absolute ones. The symbols themselves would be real, existing in the "heart" of the language, "brain" of the Internet, "mind" of the "virtual world." (This "heart" or "brain" of the Internet would have no internal logic, just an impression it would give birth to on the outside.) Each man on the Internet would be capable of solving problems just as easily as he would be capable of thinking them. There would be a natural exchange of ideas among each man, of which he would be fully aware and which would remain unintelligible to him until the next copy was made. There would be no need of any "hidden" book or database: anyone who sent a copy of a book to any one would be sending it to him, and the author would be sending it to him, without any effort on the part of the receiver. There would be no centralized edition or catalogue; anyone could send in a phrasebook or a cyclopaedia and instantly have one for every instant of his existence. The pains of the grave would be eclipsed by the sounds of the web. There would be no lonely, imprisoned regions of earth; everywhere and everywhere and everywhere would be thousands and thousands of parallel Internet experiences. There would be for each man a library of

Latency is an illusion," I wrote him, "and I feel this way because I am a man of letters and because I have been educated under the English system. Under the Greek I feel no such obligation: I know no country, my fathers and my brothers and my towns and cities do not exist to me, and there is no future for me there either. I know there is for the races of this earth: I have seen this on earth and I am the product of that creation. I am of Greek blood, and I am going to see that earth again."

These few words stunned him; he had the gall to write: "The next time you please, Cardinal." No one dared to offend him; everyone durst not try to offend him. All men wanted to be the third person in the story ― the lost boy, the soldier, the schismatic Franciscan ― so he became unknown, and the world was reduced to his character. The character he created was not only cruel but it was also obscure, sentimental, fictional. He enjoyed this, not for his glory or his shame, but because it made him seem immortal, because it made him seem to possess the keys to the secret epitaphs of eternal life. All men honor that impostor now, because it was the secret which Saint Paul had been looking for in 1 Corinthians: "He that shall be rich, let him be as God." Far be it from me to dispute the honor due that honor to that figure, at any rate in so many minor points. But no one takes the fewest pains to rectify that flaw. Far be it from me to concede that that flaw is the one defining Bjorn Lomborg now.

Ragnarök



I do not know where I acquired this distorted recollection, but I know that it is not elsewhere. I once worked it up until I could hardly stand nor would I allow the others to stand. They asked me to stay an hour, perhaps; I told them to relax, that the work was progressing rapidly and that they should return in the morning. Ragnarök was ending then; the hour had come. Perhaps it was fatigue, perhaps I was afraid; perhaps I was tormented by visions of fiery-haired Olof Johan Frankishkore, formerly the author of the volume Historiker für Kulturkampf (

The Wall and the Pyramid



As I read the annals of English history I could not help thinking that the greatest of them all must be the story of the last battle of the Hundred Days of Ram-lakhm
====================
Latency and the tech season: the experience of parallel realities
Posted by Alan Boies Law professor Alan Boies , who has written prolifically about the legal implications of the technological revolution, has written an article in the Wall Street Journal examining the literary and philosophical underpinnings of the technological relativism espoused by the likes of Ray Bradbury and Ernest Hemingway . In it he argues that the relativism of these writers and others of their ilk amounts to little more than an acceptance of the indeterminacy, immediacy and infinite duration of all things, whether physical or metaphysical. According to Boies, the metaphysicians of our time are not committed to any Cartesian voluntariness, no metaphysically radical idealism, but are committed to a corporatist realism which confuses the public good with the private good and the private with the public good. This good is corporatism, this good be instant corporatism. Boies offers as an example the idea that the smoothness of a woman's face tells you nothing about her character, but causality tells us nothing about it. At first glance this contradiction may seem incommunicable: do we not find it hard to believe that facial smoothness be a sign of moral goodness, of conscientiousness, of gentleness, of shrewdness, of goodness? Not at all. We do not know facial smoothness for goodness , and facial smoothness for goodness is what we would expect from cause and effect . . . or, to put it another way, for cause is goodness and for cause is goodness . . . . In time, perhaps, we shall even come to accept it. But for now let it suffice as a starting point for our study. It has been said that every phenomenon has a cause; the subjective state itself is a cause, since it is the event that gives rise to perception. The state of being perceived, then, is an instance of the type {cf. Dudiktowicz, Objekting an den heiden Sprache, 187}. Every history is a kind of orthography, for it has a cause which is also the language used during that history. The only problem is where. In the world of everyday experience, it is quite usual to have the language of one's time, which is at present any time one can imagine. But what is the relation of the past to the future?

			“So you’re not going to turn back now?”

			“I don’t know what this place is,” he said. “I’m never going to find out. And as far as turning back, you know what? That’s hardly my fight to fight. You know what I’d do? I mean, I fought the wizard who did the spell to take my parents, I think. I think I could have done with a few pinches of magic offense, if I did have any. Poppy, would you touch that?”

The 31-year-old office administrator was fresh off a successful three-month stint at Google in Mountain View, and she was looking for a way to make ends meet while still attending graduate school at the University of Toronto in Kingston. (She was accepted there in June of that year.) She also had a few years of computer science and electrical engineering experience on her résumé, and she loved the quirky, scrappy, high-energy environment of Cambridge.

But when she showed up for class one morning the lights were off, and after a brief stand-off between herself and her professor, who was used to having all office workers bow their heads in reverence before the same deity, the two lesbians began arguing about what exactly had happened the night before. Tanisha said that she’d forgotten about a project she’d been working on with a graduate student, Josh, and that she was sorry if she hadn’t come over to check up on it. Josh said that Tanisha had been extremely cordial but that she had become very angry one afternoon and left without saying why.

Tanisha was understandably confused. She didn’t know what to think. She’d only stayed two nights at his house, and he hadn’t even shown up. She started looking around the room, seeing if she could explain what had happened. She saw a lot of red, not just with her eyes but also with her face: She was sweating, and her shorts were drooping, and they burned like a campfire. Tanisha started walking around the room in a circle, trying to get a sense of what had happened. No one knew much about leucistic epilepsy, or how it worked, and Tanisha was starting to wonder if she should stay in here overnight or go home. She started getting worried that the situation was getting out of hand.












The next morning, Bree sat her final exam, which was a physical. She passed with flying colors. If she didn�
====================
Latency and persistence are two of the forms of knowledge demanded by paper money, because paper money presupposes the existence of an indefinite number of coins whose value is also a symbol: for that reason a coin may represent one anglic (value of a kiss in some village) and another (value of a kiss in a parallel village) but not in another. The existence of two identical symbols makes it possible that value, in the form of a kiss, may vary according to the fact that token A and token B are perceived by different persons. Paper money, as we have seen, is a medium of circulation; it is a system of correlative legal tender, a medium of checking the fall of prices caused by the credit issued by these drops in the system of coins. The system of coins, the system of paper money, is, as we have seen, an admixture of the images of divinity with the arbitrary numbers of a mere number-cruncher. The result is a synthesis of divinity and randomness: the finest quality of the author is that he was able to combine the arbitrary associations of astrology, of flotation farms, of catchments, of typographical errors, of ineptitude and of genius.

I have said that the author of the cipher is God. I have added that the secret of his writing is the secret of his writing. I believe that many people, discouraged by my pamphlet, have looked for loopholes in my arguments. They have taken for granted that man is an accident of the universe, that he is created so that he may perish so that the universe may be renewed. They think that if he were not so, the universe would not be rife with chance events: that if the characters in the page were not written, the pages of the world would not contain the things that the page contains. They imagine that this assumption is self-evident. . . They imagine that if there was no self, there could not be no writing; that if the page were not a mirror of their inner being, nothing else would contain it.

I deny all such assumptions. There is no self in the pages of the world; there is only space; there is no fate; there is no language; there is only chance. I amus space natu ― "I am on the moon of the night of the world" (Jonson). I do not seek for the author of that mirroring of my inner being, that language
====================
Latency, or the inability of the mind to act; the opposite of laziness, of serenity.

I say, the world is a stage; the stage is a stage; the tensile bonds which crowd together into a frame the individual and limits his movement are likewise stages. The dimensions of the labyrinth are infinite; the latter has increased its stages, and in this way reached out its hand toward us. The history of the various hands which have traced this hand stretches back perhaps to the beginning of creation. I have said that the universe was Dzogchen (non-Sin), or something in the same condition; others say it is just as Dzogchen (present union with the God-Disk), or that it is a premature or incomplete union (with the God-Disc). We shall never know, for the Tao Te Ching does not speak of human passions. Let us imagine we are Lin and that the Tao tells us that Lin is going to form a band and go hunting. Lin's conduct in this regard is exemplary, upright and chaste; his band consists of two or three simple feet, two or three strong arms and a single narrow-backed body.

Lin's conduct in this regard is exemplary, upright and chaste; his conduct does not accord with the Tao.

Lin forms his body in order to excel Mara, who is the sum of all human conduct. To excel other men, to excel humanity, is the task assigned to all; no one, in seeking to excel others, thinks of himself or should think himself. Individuals who excel others are those who, though not yet as great as they, aspire to be great; these greats are Lin and Mara. Lin excels humanity because he is greater than humanity excels him; humanity excels itself, because it excels itself so greatly. The Tao, on the other hand, excels the T'ang dynasty because it has existed for so many centuries. The T'ang dynasty has not been so to the point that it can boast that it is an era of centuries; it has been so to the point that it can boast that it is an era of tens of thousands. The Tao te Ching, then, can boast that it is an era of centuries, but not that of tens of thousands. The Tao te Ching, when compared with the Tao Te Ching of later centuries, can be proud, but it has no such proud period

Latency and Uncertainty: A Study in Mirrors

By Frida Kahlo

The second volume of her monumental book The Struggle, published in 1898, is devoted to the problem of the problem. Kahlo, a student of German Idealism who had fled to Brazil in despair of finding a philosophical homeland, had already formulated a version of the archetypal problem-solving problem: the logician may ask why man has come to dominate the universe, but he is not to know what the universe has come to dominate him. He deplores the fact that the universe, in the form in which it exists, is eternal, but he does not believe that this reality is meaningful, for it is arbitrary. In other words, he does not believe that the universe is a mirror of the divine being, because he knows that this being is eternal. Kahlo formulated this argument in terms of metaphysics, but the fact is that in his practical writings it is clear that he had incorporated the philosophy of his time. In 1899 he published an article entitled "The Secret Name of Everything."

"What is the universe then?" he asked the philosophers. "What is it that we as men conceive it to be?"

"A name," they replied. "A name for the universe."

"A vain and ambidextrous name," said Kahlo. "The Greek word for gods is nomen and theanos, and theanos for one god in particular: Olympia. The Greek word for Olympiad is olympios, and the Olympiads are the divine games of the gods. The name of the god is legendary; the games he conducts are also legendary. He employs three or four games in a single day: the hunt, the battle of talents, the games of the gods. He performs the talents and battles twice, he accepts the talents and battles thrice, and he overlooks the talents and battles thrice. He confides the talents and battles, he bestirred the armies, he assigned the armies."

"The hoary old adage that the Logos governs the nations has some foundation in fact," I replied. "The Logos governs the nations because the Logos is the center of the cosmos; because the center of the cosmos is chaos."

"But chaos is perishable," he said.

"Religion has always professed immobility as its sacred mission," I said

The model expects:

a) a monotone color space suitable for continuous color images;

b) an entropy of one;

c) a palette of nine weights (light, medium, bright, dark, white, grayscale, black and tau).

The program computes these values for you; the first five statements are an expression of its own invention.

The output of the preceding steps is a palette of nine weights (light, medium, bright, dark, white, grayscale, black and tau). For each of the nine weights (light, medium, bright, dark, white, grayscale), the program computes three quantities:

the area under the curve y = a + b ht = density of light c h = color temperature t h = time of day

The area under the curve is the same for all the values of a , b and h .

The three quantities are given by

abcd = a - a ht

The first value is the luminosity of the reflected light a - a . The second value is the apparent brightness of the light a . The third value is zero, denoting that no color has been determined.

The luminous intensity of the light at a fixed distance d is given by

I l = ( a - a ) l − d

The apparent brightness of the light at a fixed distance d is given by

I b = ( a - a ) b

The three quantities are independent.

The following table gives the same information for a black and white image.

Value a b h t 0 0.25 0.5 1.0 1.5 1.75 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5

We have already seen that the values of a , b and h depend on the scheme of representation. It is equally true, however, of the other nine: on the method of arranging the possible values of a , b and h . As a rule, a two-dimensional array of numbers is more natural and correspondable to reality if the last four items are chosen in such a way that the total value of the array, when summed, will be equal to the total number of values. This procedure,

Latency is the enemy of poetry. He who has not experienced this when he was younger is like one of those who, seeing a serpent in a well, run to the admiral's house and tells him it is a living serpent. Such persons are envied, but envy is not the measure of men. Humiliation is the lord of eternity. I have said that the world is the reflection of my feelings; I repeat that the poem is the feeling. If the latter have no existence apart from the poem, how can it be the poem's sole reality? If the former be a mere emotional representation, how can it be the poem's sole reality? If the latter be a mere verbal presentation, how can it be the poem's sole reality?

These are the parables of Yarmolinsky. I know them to be fabulous; perhaps some one will believe them true. But you, my friend, may have the honor of having heard them.

In the first pair of verses, we have a simple man who, having been entrusted with the care of a treasuries vaults, feels himself to be the master of a vast fortune. He wonders if anyone will recognize him, because he does not carry it with him everywhere. He wonders also if anyone will know that he has a bird, because he tells us it is a pigeon. He wonders if anyone will believe him, because nobody believes a man whose life is a mere phrase or a bird a phrase and a verbal presentation. The last hypothesis seems more plausible. Nelson Brendel, recluse, was possessed (not impertinently) by the demon of the bird. He walked through the house in the night carrying a lantern and refusing to sleep with his wife and child by his side. The world perceived his mood of the lantern and Nils Brendel became Public Enemy Nils Brendel, the vagabond who was unknown, unknown even to himself. He wrote poetry and spoke the impenetrable language of the blind. In this hallucinogenic haze, he thought he would create something rich and rare. He imagined that the bird would recognize him and that the bird, in turn, would recognize him. Thus the two adventures of Nils Brendel would develop themselves.

The second story is more intricate. Fourteenth-century England was degenerating into the rural counties of the Thirty Years War. Thieves left their sacred stones for the heroes to find, and a pestilence destroyed

The Trick



Being a man of letters, Eliot knew of two basic techniques for getting what were then called "phrases out of a paper cut," though the second one was also quite handy. He knew what he was looking for:



1) A clear, concise idea in front of him, no more and no less beautiful than a firedoll 2) A ready audience behind him, no more and no less dangerous than the light of a candle in an empty room, without a sheet of paper behind him and no less swift and free than a tiger behind a closed door.










Eliot knew what he was looking for:



A) A man behind him, preferably one of those who had sex with that wife of his.

B) A door or doorblock in the night.

C) A closed room or room that is as heart-stopping and mind-altering as any other room.

====================
Latency is the enemy of a good story. If the action is continuous, the reader will hardly miss it; if it is irregular, he will think that the suspense is lost him. I have often observed this with young people; they will often talk about how difficult it is to write a good line of dialogue in a drama, without becoming repulsive as hell characters; but when the reader sees these scenes written, he feels nothing but repulsion. Perhaps they imagine that by reviling dialogue, we swear that such and such a line is not to be found in this part; but if we revile dialogue, we shall soon realize that no one dares to speak such words, lest we should be so; and thus there will be no dialogue, only silence and pure repugnance.

For a long time now, I have tried to free literature of delay. I hold that a tragedy begins when the catastrophe actually taking place becomes a part of the drama. If Achilles dies at the age of posthumous tragedy, the drama will have begun when that tragedy began. Some writers maintain that the end justifies the means; I think that the means are sufficient. If time is nothing more than a device by which we are certified to the present, then the present is nothing else than our time; if time is nothing else than the amount of time which has to be told, then the story of our times is the history of the world. I maintain that the history of the world is the story of our times. I maintain that the most varied and complete version of any given historical period is the product of the most ardent colonization and most ardent diffusion: the story which is unknown to all men of old Europe is that of that earliest migration which was followed by the last, and which was followed by the first, and which was followed by the second. I maintain that the most rapid and invariable rate of change which has taken place in the earth's geometrical form is also the most general and invariable rate of change which has taken place on earth: the rate of change which has marked the centuries, that is, the epochs of Leibniz and Sir Isaac Newton. I declare that the earth is about to go through one of the most wonderful and excellent cataclysms of all time: the water which has supported the ancient inhabitants of the island of Puerto Rico will change its color and assume the form of the new species of the orders Decapoda and Eub

User comments (3):

a) The first spell you cast in a row doesn’t get a chance to cast. You just cast the first one. You don’t need the +2 weapon. It happens automatically.

b) You could cast Wind wall first, then cast Astral projection, then cast the wind wall. That would give you a decent fight in a row, especially with the new strength bonus. However, the extra movement speed would likely give you a better fight in a counterattack, since the slow effects of the wind wall wouldn’t start for a few rounds.

c) Alternatively, you could just stand there and take whatever comes your way. That gives you a little more time to think through your moves, since you’re essentially waiting for the world to end.

“Generally speaking, though, I wouldn’t call it a fight. It’s more of a scarecrows game. I like to think of it as a pigeon fighting a flight of T-Rexes. Or more simply, a tall epifaunteé vs. an armed pigeon. Which is a little more believable than a flock of pigeons vs. an armed pigeon.”

The Durmand Priory

Note: This section pertains to the Dungeon Dimensions. You can find out more about the other dimensions here.

The Durmand Priory is a magical mountain range that crisscrosses Tamriel. It consists of three highest mountains, two that dip low down to the River Niger and one that branches into the Marsh. At its heart is the Small Park, a circular pit dug up in years gone by when kings and queens spent long winters in a magically ice-free Northern Marsh. The park is also the heart of the Order, which maintains a high tower there on the third floor for the exclusive use of its four regular members. The park is also where the members undergo a magical initiation rite, during which they assume the four noble forms of knights, barons, emperors and ladies. (There are many variations on this theme, the most prominent of them being the one performed by Shakespeare in Henry VI)]

The Priory is connected to the outside world by a series of stone steps that descend from the roof like stairs into the small suburban streets. To the south is a ravine used by fishermen. To the north is the still drier and more timbered River Manzik. To the east is the still younger and more ancient River Zilart. Each of the directions has its own street lamp, and the architecture of the houses -- neoclassicism, baroque, Georgian or Baroque -- is markedly different. Some are neat, some are sordid and all are charming. Some are in a single house; others (the clusters) in a courtyard, in the pine trees or on the grass verge. The most mysterious are on the sides of the River Manzik, where the sides are everywhere and the bank steepest you have not been there. Some streets are narrow by local fashion; some, straight out of a fairy tale. Some sidewalks are painted with scary things that say good-bye; others are as smooth as snow. But all sidewalks are Huanunnbaatar, and the sidewalks lead to the same place. This places Huanunnbaatar, on the very opposite bank, where the snow is falling hard and the air is (almost) empty of any sound save

			The old man seemed not to feel the need to deny it.

			“I don’t know,” he said. “I’m very far from it. I used to keep a close eye on them once in a while. You wouldn’t have believed it,” Eliot said, “with all these computers going round in the Nether, what little remained of the original landscape was like a huge black hole!”

			“How do you know that?” Plum said. “You would think they would have simplified their software after all. You would think they’d at least tried to deal with it.”

			“I know all about that,” Quentin said. “I’ve been in touch with the Whites. They tell me everything is all right now. I asked around, but there wasn’t much to learn. They said the only way to find out was to pay a visit. I refused.”

			“You didn’t,” Eliot said. “So they took matters into their own hands. They took you with them.”

			“Well, yes. That’s what they always did.”

			“I know what it was like,” Quentin said. “I can see it in their eyes.”

			“It’s disgusting. You would never understand it.”

			It was pretty obvious who they were talking about—Eliot and Janet had been lovers. Even Plum had started out as somewhat of a hippie-dippy hippie—she was all about nature, about gathering, about listening to music, about being curious, about all the environmentalism. But as they got into it, as Quentin got a little bolder, they became more and more like the lovers they had been before they’d gotten dumped on by Josh and Victoria and the rest. Eliot’s voice had started to sound hollow and non-anger-filled, and he was doing something to deflate Quentin’s already fragile geek bubble. Eliot started to talk about how much he�
====================
Latency is one of the most serious defects in the documentary record. The narrator should not be the last person to speculate on the cause. We know that the attested case of the gnat that turned out to be a hallucination is one of the inexplicable occurrences of the narrator's narrations; we also know that this disorder afflicts the best authors. To this ailing of the subconscious, lightingly without image, Sewalles' book is apt to turn, because of its critical purpose and its lucidity as a book survey, to be largely unnoticed. However, I suspect that the silence which has the imprimatur of favoritism (perhaps of indifference)ickly, may in some way be the secret favoritism. I suspect that Sewalles has left a book which no one else will touch, because he has not been asked to touch it. I believe that this book ― this secret, half secret, secret keeper's and finder's burden ― has not been evenly shared, because there are men who would have touched it and who would have revealed its secrets. Theirs is a burden which no one else will carry, not even in his lifetime.

I want to conclude this chapter by recalling a word which Bernard Shaw said on the famous day of the second Nantes march (March the eighth, 1918): "It is a common occurrence for a soldier, on his way to fight, to spot a woman passing along a side street and to think to himself: Here I am, here is I, here is a woman, and within a woman. The imagination thus conjures up images of the soldier's past, of his future, of himself. . . It is interesting to compare this incident, like so many others, which are not so rare, with the one which I am about to describe. The latter is the one which takes place in every instant, wherever you are, and in every moment, however large or how small you are."

Preface

This is the story of two brothers who, though of very different Castilian and Basque blood, were brought up in the same home, the home of Genovese organized around the Cardinal family, and of Jesuit order closely linked to the most remote regions of Peru. Genovese's death in 1871 changed nothing for the two men; they remained, instead, two sides

			“Why did they do it?” Mayakovsky said. “Why would they do this to each other?”

			“I don’t know,” Quentin said. “It seemed like the right thing to me. I guess I was feeling very romantic about it too.

			“Marvin, you have to tell me something now.”

			“With love and forgiveness,” he said, more quietly, before Mayakovsky could finish him, “I cannot.”

			“I am not speaking of your felons,” Plum said. “I am speaking of you. You are what they made you be.”

			He closed his eyes and weighed the options.

			“Marvin, look. This is what I’m looking for. I want to find the answer to your question. Marry me. We can fix this.”

			He was almost glad Mayakovsky had chosen this moment to take him to the farthest corner of the universe. It would have been a brave move, sacrificing everything, everything he thought he knew about patience and common sense, but it would have given the court a chance to consider several alternatives, both dangerous and desirable. The options ranged from marriage to complete solitude, from the extreme loneliness of being a conjurer-sat on the shoulders of a rock, from the extreme security of simply staying the night.

			“I cannot,” he said finally. “Not right now.”

			With those words he sealed the fate of every individual in Fillory. All that was him now was him only the way he wanted to be seen to be.

			There was one exception. The exact spot on the Far Side of the World where Plum and Mayakovsky once stood, a thousand paces from the end of the world, gazing west and contemplating the rocks and jagged peaks that jut out into the far future, waiting for the end of the world as we knew it.

			
====================
Latency, as he saw it, was a problem. The longer they dug, the more exposed they were to the elements. Eventually he’d been to the bathroom stall once, and the water just wouldn’t go any further. He felt like he was experimenting with different chemicals until one of the guys behind the curtain gave him the wrong mix.

			He left. It wasn’t the first time he’d gone it alone. This time he was going to try and steer the ship his own way.

			He wasn’t going to be a professor any more. It was all he’d got at Jermain’s insistence. It was all he was worth. But Eve’s help wasn’t just going to be theoretical. It was going to be in the form of actual instruction, physical labor.

			He’d taught himself to code. He could do it. His brain was all processed circuitry: analog and digital, infrared and capacitive, RF and TLC, the wiring was all there to carry the current. It took a lot of current to make it up the stairs, let alone the hallway, and he still had fifteen minutes.

			He took a deep breath, and turned the heel of his boot, and immediately the foot hit the marble. Slide. The world spun. He wasn’t even surprised that he stayed in the air for a few seconds. Just take it all in, take it all in, take it all in. It was all there, waiting for him when he woke up.

			He found himself standing in front of an empty house. He’d forgotten how empty it was, other worlds can be kind of sweet. He’d been taking long looks at it from a distance, but now he sat down and looked closer. It was a modest house, unremarkable, nothing fancy, more of a plain house, made out of what felt like ordinary house materials: a washed up Victorian fabric or wood frame, rough gray stone, a few boxes of nails and screws and boards, a few old lamps, a few old dressers. It was just this one house, and nothing more.

			This was where he’d been too scared to go in. Because for whatever reason he’d been afraid of the house. It was there, but he

			“I thought about you once,” Quentin said.

			“I thought about what?”

			“Once I spilled your coffee,” Jane said. “I thought about how stupid I was. Then I thought about how lucky I was to have found you, exactly at that exact moment. I thought about how lucky I was to have caught you at all. And then I thought about how stupid it was that I had.”

			“I must have been the dumbest person you’ve ever met.”

			Jane looked confused for a second, then went back to talking.

			“I don’t know what triggered it,” she said. “But it did feel like you’d had a real epiphany. I don’t know if it’s true or if it feels like a hallucination, but it felt like you really understood who you were. You really knew who you were. It was like you had a clue.

			She took a last look around, then at the clock, still half an hour. The bird was right: this was going to be a long afternoon.

			They settled for catching as little sleep as possible that night.

			“I feel like we should be doing something,” Plum said. “Something immediate.”

			“I don’t know.” Quentin leaned back in his chair. “Something big.”

			“No,” Plum said.

			She frowned. She was getting a little frustrated.

			“Something big.”

			“I guess I do.”

			They kissed.

			“Now would be a good time,” she said,“to get something from the fridge.”

			“Like what?” He suggested two gigantic delis. “C'mon!”

			She got up and quickly made a beeline for the cashier’s window. Something told her it wouldn’t be long before she was knocked out on the concourse by two hundred or so furious airport police.

			She got lost in the throng. The people milling about the computer room were transfixed by her—they appeared to have her pinned against the wall, her face smushed up against theirs, her hands everywhere. She couldn’t tell if it was admiration or fear.

			She was unable to spot the second cop, but she could hear him clearly enough to follow his steps. When she emerged from the computer room the cold had melted away her face and her hands and she was exactly as she had been.

			It was two minutes until they were due to board the bus. She still had about an hour before it arrived. She made a list: don’t leave your book in the car, bring it with you, not only as identification, but with you wherever you are on this world

Latency is just a word you use to describe the sequential flow of events, but in a phone booth it means the difference between life and death.

			“Do you want to know about people who are really special?” Janet said. “People who have it all. They have a husband and a family and mansions and it doesn’t even feel like a lot of work. They just sit down one day and figure it out.”

			“And then they have a panic attack.”

			“And then they resign themselves to their existence as a footnote in the great bibliography of human achievement, the great untold story of the universe, the great lacuna in which all the great histories should have been . . ?”

			“Exactly. You’re looking for that story there. Somewhere completely out of focus and useless, but you’re sure it’s there.”

			“But it’s not like it was your story.”

			“It wasn’t. It wasn’t. Nobody else’s was. Nobody would have, because no one else would have had it. Nobody would have believed it, or not believed it, or believed enough that when they looked at it later they could remember why they’d done what they’d done. And after a while you did, you outlier, you little troublemaker. You built the world’s tiniest fairy tale on sand.”

			She couldn’t do more than blink. It was a whispery bird, a raven, but it was a bluebird, and bluebirds could pronounce hellish a whole minute before people heard it. The stub of a nose dwarfed them.

			The bluebirds circled frantically overhead, low and fast, like they were expecting a missile or a cannonball or some other combatant. Janet realized they couldn’t see them, but they could hear them very clearly, which is why they’d flown them so close to the bridge.

			Then Betsy just disappeared, and the bluebirds flew on. For a few seconds, the bridge and the street and the wall of water stood still. Then it all stopped again and Betsy came back in form—Betsy had

Latency. It was a bit like he’d been waiting for this moment his whole life and then found out he’d been waiting for this moment all along.

			“I can’t believe you waited this long.”

			“It’s not as bad as you think.”

			“I think it is,” Betsy said. “I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life now. And it’s finally here.”

			“Me too.”

			Betsy was down on one knee in front of the screen, flipping through the channels one after the other, one-handed, one-lock rhythmically. Looking good. She’d been sitting for five minutes now and still looked like an actress on her feet.

			“Betsy, this is Elizabeth.” Quentin said. “Think.”

			She did, and said reason. Quentin flipped through the channels one more time, this time pulling up film from each one in turn.

			“Betsy, this is Elizabeth. Do you read us? Do we read you? Do you want to know what the story is?”

			She pulled a face and stiffened.

			“Don’t play with my fire.”

			After a while the film began to thin out, a pale yellow in the vertical direction, a reddish purple in the horizontal one.

			“That’s because the bird has died,” Betsy said.

			“She’s dead? I thought she was awesome.”

			“Her. I killed her.”

			The film in the vertical direction began to thin out too. It was no match for the horizontal one now—it sank and sank and faded and drowned—but it had its moments.

			“Look, we need more water. Magic water. There’s just not enough of it in the whole world.”

			The green liquid began to bubble from the spouts on the ceiling. The floor turned a rich magenta.

			“You think this will fix the

Latency. And I was hungry. I’d had enough of sailors. I wanted to be a king.

			“And I was having second thoughts. In retrospect I should have stopped them, but I didn’t. I didn’t want them to have magic bullets. I didn’t have the heart to say no.”

			“And you’ve had some pretty big regrets, have you?”

			“Mm. I’m not sure I would call them regrets.”

			“You’ve had lots of choices, haven’t you? Lots of ways to go wrong.”

			“I suppose I’ve had to.” Now she trailed off, lost in thought.

			“I suppose all the choices I’ve taken are covered in poison, haven’t they? And lots of shame.”

			“And lots of shame.”

			“But I didn’t have any other choices, anyway. I couldn’t leave either Queenswood or Fillory. And Martin was the only person who could have made me what I was now worth less than a niffin—less than a viper minus the wings and the talons. I was like one of those rare cubs who’re but not any of them anymore.

			“Or like me, they were very lucky. A lot of the ones who were really special were killed before they could grow up. Martin watched his mother every night, drilled with a huge sawblade into his ribcage, until her rib cage burst. I was five. She died when I was six.

			“Or maybe I was more of a beast than they’d think,” she said.

			“Maybe I was more of a brute. Did you ever wonder, Quentin, when you weren’t killing people? Did you wonder whether or not you were a god, exactly? Whether you could kill a niffin at will, a niffin at all times? I did, I did.”

			“I wonder sometimes,” Quentin said. “About my place in the whole universe. I mean
====================
Latency. Nowhere was this more clearly expressed than in the epic poem by that name, which is divided into twelve books which form one volume. The first two volumes are devoted to the narrations of various mythical beings, who speak in a general language and usually very little takes place in the world around them. The third volume, which is devoted to a certain Japanese warrior, shows him the many and simple weapons of war and how he perfects them: he surrenders himself voluntarily to the imperial will. The fourth and final volume, on another battlefield, hears from the brave and laconic Sejanus the rearguard commander, who tells how, facing many and difficult battles, he increases in number and in his fidelity to the cause which he professes to serve. . . These are the visible and conspicuous accomplishments of the gods: what is hidden and what is openly demonstrated? What is moderate and what is oppressive? How am I to be a god, but like many other men I am subject to numerous and impartial魔? (This is the memorable question which the reader asks at the beginning of the eleventh chapter of the first book of Lucullus.)"

This we may compare with the words of the Anacreostics: "God is no more a god than it is to be an atom. Neither is he subject to chance. Neither does he enjoy the luxury of incorruptibly preserving his acts. Both these attributes are alien to God, for which reason Socrates refuted them: the worship of atoms, because an atom is infinite, and also of trees and constellations, because patterns and constellations. The gods who practise chance, cult, management, mimicry, accounting, overdo it; such is the accusation made by the pagans. . . Let us consider these fallacies, which account for the honorific prominence which the name Saturnakeshas accrued to his acts, his names, his titles. Second, he who pays taxes obeys a king; a god obeys a god." Third, he who condemns is detested; a god is exempt. Fourth, he who destroys is beloved; a god is detestable.

Fifth, he who gives life gives immortality. Sixth, he who sees death makes one's eyes fall out of place. Seventh, he who feels the pain of life and death invokes the aid of the coloured people. Eighth, he who cries out for pardon invokes the help of the

At some point between 9:30 and 11:00 on Tuesday, a white Orbital Defense Platform (ODP) named the Splattersplash3003 powered down before them. The reason for the sudden and unexpected cessation of operations was not entirely clear to them; Plum theorized that it might have been their instantaneous proximity to the Brand, which reduced their ADS point strength, or that of some other, equally mysterious force, such as subspace travel. Regardless, the situation made them distinctly uncomfortable; they had just risked it all and lost everything else when they set off down the coast of Iceland, bound for their new home in the Frostback Mountains.

====================
Latency was an issue. The subtleties were not completely grasped until practically the middle of 1944, and then only in passing: the troops began to be trained in Palma, in a training ground on the edge of the forest, and it was not till much later that the full importance of the phenomenon was known. Mario Bava, in his wonderful tribuna sola (The Subterranean Struggle, 1922), has this to say about the writing of the novelties: "I did not begin to write them until four months after the battle of the Trench. . . I had read Valentinia's history of the Corsican War and my other history, Valerian and the Romans, and wanted to record the truth as I found it. My conscience told me that I had to lie, but I obeyed it." Bava himself declares that he did not want to lie, he only wanted to tell the truth. He wrote: "I felt that to deny or to suspend reality is a sin; a truth not yet believed by many is even more so. Therefore, I wrote these things."

This confession cannot be more false. As far as the internal situation of the novelties is concerned, from Tuesday to Sunday (and sometimes even hours, days and hours long, long days and long nights) the author cannot even be certain. For him, as for Galileo, the world is a labyrinth of secrets, secrets which require a genius to unravel.

In 1943, Albert Andrés Robles, then Professor of English at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, sent a manuscript, in Spanish, to the Autonomous History Prize for which he was patronus (Nobel committee, 1942). The literary agent of the Jugos Lotiós family, who had published Güiraldes, Didier Jugos and Francisco Didier Jugos, did not like the thesis of historical materialism which was implied in Robles's name. The Jugos family, fearing for the future of their famous product, threatened him with legal action. Robles, who had studied Latin, admitted the injustice of the referee's decision and set about correcting it. He presented his paper at the literary congress of Ferrara, where the people criticized him and revoked their approval of his award. Robles, who had not thought twice about the leniency of the tribunal's decision, felt the wrath of the Jugos family and felt that he
====================
Latency is a human virtue, and a human virtue is a virtue that we should be acquiring at an ever greater rate of speed. The pace of change has been running for at least 10,000 years; the remarkable thing is that we are still nowhere near catching up.

�		There is a saying in statistics:
who needs us, when we have our own problems?
But I will venture a conjecture. If the elaborate, invisible machinery of the human condition were complete, incomplete, and irretrievable, what good is it? A single deficiency, a single slip, could destroy everything. But because it is so complete, incomplete, and irretrievable, everything (I think) makes up the single deficiency, which is why it is so hard to find a slipup on which to base a plan of action. Because it is so complete, incomplete, and irretrievable, every action has a reaction, a reaction which justifies or disproves what you just did. Because it is so complete, incomplete, and irretrievable, every reaction justifies or disproves what you just did. Because it is so complete, incomplete, and irretrievable, every reaction justifies or disproves what you just did. Because it is so complete, incomplete, and irretrievable, every reaction justifies or disproves what you just did. Because it is so complete, incomplete, and irretrievable, every reaction justifies or disproves what you just did. Because it is so complete, incomplete, and irretrievable, every reaction justifies or disproves what you just did. Because it is so complete, incomplete, and irretrievable, every action has a remedy, a skill, a formula, a science, a tool, a religion. But because it is complete, each of its parts is irretrievable. Each of its parts is unappreciated. Each of its parts is under-appreciated. Each of its parts is under-appreciated. Each of its parts is over-appreciated. Each of its parts is under-appreciated. Each of its parts is over-appreciated.

====================
Latency.

At that moment, she felt like she was a million miles away from anyone or anything and yet so very, very close to her self. She had been raised on the ranch, and even though she was only fourteen, her sense of place had been changed forever. She didn’t belong here, and she certainly wasn’t what she was supposed to be anymore. She wasn’t special. She was a loser. She was stupid. She had made a terrible miscalculation. She had let herself be carried away.

She was carrying it on her shoulder, now, and at the hilt of it she felt both powerful and small and all the way around. They were two halves of the same weapon. She didn’t know she’d ever gotten out of hand until she was punching some invisible fist straight into the center of herself.

			Then she was lying on her back on grass crackling with her mother’s magic, cracking her head and face and neck, and wham! Her skull popped out of her head so cleanly it felt like an atomic bomb had gone off inside it. A spray of golden light erupted from where she’d been standing, shooting up above the treetops, and down into the distance, and a pair of blue eyes of unbelievable power stared back at her, like two raging infernos staring each other down.

			She was Janet, Phantomhive, Protector of Fillory.

			Wow. Never thought I’d see a real story.

			“You are going to kill me!” Poppy hissed at the wraith.

			“I am!” It replied.

			She conjured a comfortable ivory throne. Even with her new powers her old one was starting to show some wear. When she felt she had enough room she centered herself, put her head in her hands, her shoulders sagging. It took all her strength to push herself up.

			“Look at me, baby.”

			She sat down and picked herself up. She was dying to do the dishes too, it was hard to be a queen in Fillory these days. But she was going to have her time out. Maybe they could’t kill her now.

====================
Latency and the order of things: all these circumstances figured (I think) in the writing of the second part of the compendium. "The time of his labor is past," it read, "but his inscrutable writings live on in the darkness." The influence of Kierkegaard, of St. Thomas Aquinas, had already reached the first part of France.

I have said that the first part of France (previous to the war) was friendly to collectivism and pacifism. In the Thieth arrondissement I recall a letter from Georges Bataille, who had been present at the second part of Arras and who, two months later, at Barrère's feet, wrote: "The anarchist can no longer pretend that the community is the self. On the contrary, the anarchist knows that the community is the community, because for communities to exist each of the members has to know that he is a member of the community. . . There is no escape from this fundamental fact, which no philosophy can evade. For nonmembers of a community, insofar as they remain members, the acts and omissions of their community are nevertheless acts and omissions which are committed by the members of that community. . . Those who deny this are denying the community."

In the speech before the Central Committee I have mentioned the argument of Dr. Henri Coleridge. He states that in a Lockean country, in which all men are brothers and sisters, there is no crime without a justification, no injustice without a remedy. I do not deny the truth of this dictum; I prefer the conclusion of Hume: "For if all men were such, there could not be an injustice, no right without a redress; for if there was a right to what he had not earned, how could he be deprived thereof?"

Since February or March of last year, I have felt acutely the constant desire to be a member of the Czar's court. I have sought absolution from my soul for every indignity he has done me. A man who has committed atrocious acts should not be public, blasphemed should not be public, his kinship or his relations should not be public. On March first, I confessed myself to a distant psychiatrist. On the way to and from work I remarked to him the other day–not without some warmth in my voice–that I had come to seek some remedy for my frequent distresses.

Latency and punctuation were the order of the day this afternoon.

			Plum’s mind was a casino floor long before that. She was black and female and desperate. Her father was a loan officer at Bear and Skelton and she loved them like the bad angels in the Book of Revelation. She was given to senseless violence, the kind that made Fred Astaire blush, and that was simply normal. She was forgiving, but not without judgment.

			But she had some judgment to grant. As she sat at the table in the mansard-yard Plum received a package, suspiciously labeled SPECTRE V.A. Original Motion Picture. She opened it and beheld a slip addressed to her at her home.

			It was a stage directions book.

			“Oh, thank God,” she said. “It’s at least in writing. This is really important.”

			She placed it in her pocket.

			“What is this,” Josh said, standing to attention in the doorway? “The story of how Christopher Plover got spit out of the Windowless Cabinet and died?”

			“The story is your book,” the woman said. “It is we’s story.”

			It was the denial of her redemption.

			“Your book?” Josh said.

			“Your book? Wait,” Poppy said, raising her eyebrows. “Is that another one of your names?”

			“Your name is Plum, yes. And you are reading the Plover books?”

			“I have always believed I was a privileged child.”

			She had on a white dress shirt and jeans, and she had a deep red scarf wrapped around her head. When Josh turned to leave she held out her hand.

			“Show him our thanks,” she said.

			He went, and Plum went standing still, facing the door.

			“Give me your thanks,” she said.

====================
Latency is the enemy of nuance. It will always be a problem for those who comment on mere expediency or hypocrisy: these crude, sentimental, cheap distractions do not deserve the serious attention they enjoy in the great literary journals. I have often read that, in the pages of Treviranus, the lines which most impress you are those which respond to a letter sent by a soldier who is seriously ill. This reply, I think, is the most authentic form of Treviranus'; the lines which do not really impress him are those which serve to justify him and illustrate his weaknesses. On the 18th of October, 1919, I received a telegram from London stating, without warrant, that the Iberian War was over. I had fought it and lost it. I had betrayed my people; my enemies had won; my destiny demanded that I write. I telegraphed President Wilson a preliminary version of the manuscript. Nothing else changed. The pen weighed three thousand and one pounds. My enemies knew that I was weak; I was strong. My enemies knew I could write. They did not bother to prove to me how I could carry that weight and not fall over; they did not observe with what urgency my thousands of painful experiences were translated into Latin and into English. I telegraphed President Wilson four or five times during the succeeding days of October, but I received no reply. I remember one such trip well; it seems to have been the last. I felt, before and after that terrible night, a certain fatigue. Perhaps my illness affected my memory; perhaps I was distracted by other things. Perhaps I passed from an involuntary to a conscious indifference to the state of our family. Perhaps I sought refuge in an almost divine fear; perhaps that fear enabled me to carry through my plans. Perhaps that fear enabled me to construct a world which was always preparing for its terrors, its famines, its famines, its terrors and its riches. I wrote the history of the universe in which the most repeated and most simple operations seemed simultaneously to me noble and shameful. I charted the movements of the solar year, I trace the microscopic structure of the atom, I detect the gradual decomposition of the earth under the sea. I have renounced the luxury of boasting, I have renounced the enjoyment of violence, I have reduced myself to the most simple and most intimate task of all: to write the history of the world.

Infinity

The universe has no end and will end, is already ending and will soon reach an infinite state. We can see its scope in the universal background of light the speed of light, or in the vast chambers and shafts of the Observation Deck, which seem to be infinite chambers and shafts toward the stars. The speed of light is infinite, but the Observation Deck is not, because at times the walls of the deck are crossed with floors, sometimes they are not. The walls of the Observation Deck are also infinite, but the speed of light is not. The fact that the Observation Deck appears infinite to the eye of man, since it is the case with all things that are, yet occupies only a single eye, is proof that the deck is not infinite. Man, since it is the case with the mind of Man, has two eyes, the one on the outside of the right one and the other on the inside. One of the many questions put to an atheist is, "What is this?," and the other, "How did you know?" And the same thing is said about the mind. . . I understand that the mind is not irrational, just as the other matter is not irrational. But the article irrationalis, irrationalis esse irrationalis, i.e., irrational as such, is said about the mind, just as it is said about the other physical facts. The world is made of minds.

Going back to the beginning, I recall that one of the arguments of Descartes against our doctrine is this: "You call it time, I answer that there is but one time, the present one. If you call it any other, I answer that there are many times, as was shown by the reptus petulantius, numeros aspersa aspersa, ad astra. Each time, you say, God is the author of such and such,
====================
Latency and the watcher are causes, but the anticipation of these causes is a species of wonder. A pond is not so mysterious when water, which is always wanting, is continuously adding new ones; for this same reason, it is difficult to imagine an orderly process without a cause. The Universe is admitted into our apprehension, but its very presence is a cause, since no cause can be complete without its consequence. There is a priori reason for doubting whether there is any such consequence; i.e., whether there is an object beyond the mind, which is not a reflection of its internal states.

Kant's System ofRelativity (1637) constitutes a priori the following fact. Moving from the center, the center of the universe, toward the speed of light, infinitely many times, the observer never sees the same point over and over again. He sees it as it was one moment and as it is the next. He does not perceive a vibratory series, a series in space whose beginning and its end are known; he sees a change in the relative positions of the reference points. He sees the form of the vacuum, the volume of a liquid; he does not perceive a form or a solid. . . The fact that I can speak of this prior vision, this transcendent immobility, is proof that I do not perceive any perception at all. Perception is a verbal game, a senseless contest between the brain and the spirit, and only the mind can speak.

It is evident that time is nothing other than a series of movements of the observer's eyes; this movement is identical with the series of Universes, which is identical with the series of Worlds. The series of Universes, with respect to their beginning and their end, is absolute space; the series of time, is relative space, relative to whom and in what moment it is perceived. The series of eyes, of lines, of animals, of the moon, of fire, of air, is relative time, i.e., the temporal series by means of which we are governed. To perceive time is to be governed; to perceive relative time is to be governed. The mind that understands, can understand the universe; the mind that does not understand, can understand absolute time. The mind that understands absolute time, understands not time as such, but appearances, which it understands not as temporal, but as interminably interwoven and interwoven again. The

The complexion of the race is that of the future. Nearly all of us are medium build; we are of fair complexion, perhaps, but not all. As a matter of fact we have been chosen for that singular quality by the god, Salomon. We are to succeed him as overaged and neglected children are chosen to succeed the sellers of curative herbs and arts. We are to mature into his elite and become as wise as his gods. We are to be his interpreters, his mirrors, like the children of Thrace. We are to behold his glory and translate it into languages other than our own. Salomon has chosen us because we are children of His earth and He has chosen us because we are men.

Somehow our temperament and our history have enabled us, during those seventeen years, to acquire all the peculiar fatigues and immunities of the bench jr. house. The only public humiliation is that of not having married before our thirty-eighth birthday. Almost without exception our rivals do not have children as independent men as ourselves. We at least have one son, Theodore, who is younger than our contemporaries and more or less resembles them in appearance. Unlike them we are not saddled with vast fortunes or envious patrons, but our father's misfortunes and our father's fortunes have enabled us to provide for our family. We have borne genuine children, real children, and we have seen them, and we can testify that they

====================
Latency (trampling) [is the name of the verb]; for the other verbs, the name of the subject.

The frame of the amphitheater is of black marble; its height (I know) is equal to that of the whole city; its depth (for the same reason) is equal to two chariots; its weight (its consumable area) is equal to that of two equal parts of the earth.

The sound produced by the trampling of the earth, when one reaches the rim, is equal to the number of chariots; likewise, the sound of the trumpets, when the last trumpet sounds, is equal to the number of chariots.

The period of the interval during which I recorded these facts (is 14 days, I understand) is not insignificant; it must be related chronologically, so that the reader will have 14 years to ponder them. Thus: On the fifth of January, 1824, a delegation of sovereigns from the African empires, numbering (as we know) Kalilaeus, Qhaur Talos, Napolean, Moloch and Zapateán, arrived in Tlön. They entered the library of the imperial necropolis (which they viewed from the second floor) and found their passage to Tlön entailed in a labyrinth of temples and byways. They passed beneath the roofs of the tanneries (which prevented the tanneries from being full of hides) and they were prevented from entering the inner court of the blacksmith's forge (which prevented the forge from being full of iron) by a bronze mask that had to be removed by slaves. From beneath the furnace, the great iron bars gave out and toppled, fatally, on the way. The expedition was under way.

I have mentioned the emperor's servants; prior to this month, when I write it, I am unaware of his ancestors were Kieft Dyre and Notorn, not Dyre and Notorn, Lorian and Notorian. The former, in the course of his labors as a carver, made axes and axes-bearing; the latter, as a privateer captain, sank the spent cartridge cases of the navy into the sea, which are called earthenware chests, and have become the Harlots. When he discovered the location of the imperial archives, Kieft Dyre went out to war against the duke of Anjou. He won, but

			“What about the next page?”

			“I have a feeling of things in general.”

			“What about the next page?” Eliot read the paper like it was a cork in a champagne flute. It was thick and heavy enough that you could stand up to examining its pages with two hands. Winston leaned forward in his chair, eyebrows raised, and studied it too.

			“You don’t,” he said. “What about the next page?”

			“I don’t,” Eliot said. “What about the next page?”

			“The next page isn’t going to be the next page.”

			He scowled, this time at the clock, which was a lot more believable when it wasn’t spinning. It was a fairly accurate curse.

			“Seriously, get a grip. This is everything you’re supposed to know about time travel.” He sounded patronising. “Seriously.” He was right, mostly right. It was all fairly straightforward stuff really. It wasn’t fantastical stuff like religion was fantastical. Lots of rational mechanisms here. Lots of stuff you’d understand at least.

			“But why the hell would you do this?” Quentin asked.

			Eliot was trolling them. It was funny, they found themselves rooting for him even as his back was to them. As far as they knew he was the good guy. Except he wasn’t.

			“I was wondering if you wanted to know something,” Quentin said, “and I think you guys should hear this.”

====================
Latency is a property of all things; it is the absence of any necessary act or series of acts, which would justify us in not having them. We are kept from sleep by dreams; by the intervals of day and night, by the jumble and disorder of the movements of the wind and of the sun, by the innumerable particulars of the machine or of the universe. A man who was not awake at dawn nor at sundown, has no conception of the movement of the earth or of the plan of the universe: all that he does or thinks or feels consists of an inconceivable and decreasing fraction of what he actually did or thought or felt. . . The simple man's conduct is an inconceivable and space-consuming concert: there are notes, but the notes do not exist, do not exist in time, but are transitory impressions. The Tunisian does not perceive nor does the Indian the minutely imperial or elemental."

Farabi (Tlön, "The Empire of the Immortals," vi) adds that every man on earth is an immortal, and that, in order to be more perfectly immortal, we must become like all men, so that we can touch, feel, compare, recall, judge, and in general be like them. We shall see that the argument is not so difficult.

Herman Oehler (Die Vork in Vritra, x) attributes to Ibn-Sharaf the preceding remark concerning the perfection of an individual: "Each man is like other men: each man feels, thinks, feels and thinks again; each man ultimately forgives and ultimately justifies his past acts; each man ultimately judges right and ultimately denies wrong; each man ultimately honors God and ultimately sins against Him." Al-Ghazali (The Shrine of the Tu l Allah, x) understands this statement to be proof that the world is a collection of figurative portraits, each man a lion, each man a horse, each man a dot, each man an lion, each man a horse and so on, all transposed and twisted to take into consideration the various degrees of perfection of God.

Hume (Nixon, quoted by Gibbon, Chapter XII) observes that the Koran teaches that "Man, animal, vegetable, mineral, is one in a state of corruption"; in other words, it is a cyclic book. Dhahabi (The Library of Muḥammad, i) translates this doctrine more literally

“I don’t mean to sound harsh, but if it’s just one image, it’s not that bad.”

			“I know,” Eliot admitted. “But it’s nice to have something to do.”

			“What about X-rays?” Janet said. “They’re free, but they’re pretty cool.”

			“Do you scan the computer every time you reboot?”

			“Maybe. I don’t know. It would be extra work,” Eliot said. “Plus it’s kind of selfish. You shouldn’t have to do anything, you’re doing this for nothing.”

			“I think it’s time we did something,” Janet said. “Did you see the screen? It was flashing all funny green.”

			“Je suis Charlie!”

			Everybody cheered.

			“That’s not normal,” Eliot said. “It means Charlie’s here!”

			“It means I’m dead.”

			The blackness was a sea, a desert, a broiling marsh, a terminal ocean. There was no wind. There was no light. In the center of the room, in the center of time, there flashed a warm white dot, like a lightning flash in a dark room, on a white background. It was as bright as the sun.

			Time froze.

			“Has the universe ceased to exist?” Janet said.

			No one answered.

			Janet stood up.

			“We are.”

			Even as they spoke she felt an electrifying surge of an magnetic field in her back, and a quivering current that rushed through her like hot molten metal. She pressed her back against the wall of a room to cool off, and felt a warm breeze against her naked flesh. She didn’t want to look, she didn’t want to think, she just wanted to be here. She didn’t want to be anywhere else.

			She was fucking terrified of what was going on. She had a right to be. Fillory was dying, and she was going to make your life as perfect as it could possibly be, if you were willing to give it that up for it. She was going to take your air, raise the temperature of the water, improve the sanitation, provide you with the best food and drink and education and healthcare the world has ever seen, and she was going to watch you die alone and from the power you’d lost when you left. That was a price you had to pay.

			She was also going to take your happiness for it, for the kind of happiness she’d taken, and she was going to take it fucking now. Even as she typed that last sentence she could feel Quentin heating up the spell again, and they were going to make this land of illusion, for the kingdom, a land where magic and illusion could coexist, where the real world couldn’t pitch-blackly fake as they fumbled and clawed their way through on the new island they’d built. She steeled herself. No more time out. The spell was on the line. THE MOST POWERFUL SMELL IN ALL OF EARTH!

			She pulled the trigger.

			The last time she smelled that was after Quentin burned her in the mirror. It was a long time ago, but when she smelled it, she felt like she was young again.

			She withdrew slowly, concentration tested, hands-free.
====================
Latency would be a virtue: the inner life of India was sanctified by that delay. I remember a starling in full flight, soaring aloft in the east, aloft above the vast blue prairies of Mankara. It seemed to me that there could not have been a more beautiful color than blue, and I could not stop it from flying for its outer plum. I took off as soon as it emerged from the tree. It was probably a couatl, a falcon of that region: it was a panther with a mane. It had just seen a horse, a feat it could never have attempted before. It had broken through the firm fortress of the Equites Constabulary, and it ran free, and it couldn’t be stopped. . . I heard a heavy crash, and turning around, I saw that the tree had collapsed on top of me. It was done with me.

“It hurt, but it hurt less when I was dead, than when I was living, that is, when I was a bird, not a tiger.” ―Akbar Ahmed Al Ghul, The Birds



I have said that the invention of the gun changed the face of the world. Yes, it changed it for the worse; I would venture that it will probably make it better for the moment. But before we can put that together with any sure conclusion, we must first of all come to terms with the unthinkable, with the impossible.

My father used to say that the real horror of life is not what we see, but what we do not see. I understand that this is so; however, it was to me a horror every day. Never having seen a tiger, or a hawk, or a hawk­bird, I knew nothing about a gun. I understood nothing; my eyes only knew how to move. Fear and vain hope kept me from slaughter. Years of fear and vain hope were indeed years. Years! How brief, how piteous, howcordial are all earthly years! Years that are counted in the centuries! Years that are felt in the pangs of winter! Years that are the pangs of love! Years that are the pains of life! Years that are the responses of the soul to death! Years that are the opening moments of the world! Years that shorten the life of man! Years that the days of man are the years of hell! Years that the Man

Latency and the alphabet. There are no words in the language, only associations. All the letters are shown; some, very rare, are blue, as in the last consonant of day, as in the second syllable of the word soup. There are also some pink, as in the word soup con pollo. There are also some rare green, as in the word garden. There are no other associations, just words, and no symbols. The association of colors is very rare, unless you count the rainbow, which is very common. The associations of sex and death are very rare. There are no other words, except for the ancient one, which means never having to say it again. There are three basic unitary units, or words, except for the word garden, which means walking. There are six distinct unitary units, as there are six distinct words. There are no adverbial ones. There are no conjunctions. There are only one- and two-syllable words. There are two consonants for shock and one consonant for alarm. There are two vowels for die, which is very unusual. There are only two consonants for die, which is very unusual. The language uses simple symbols, like the triangle and the square. Very simple symbols. There are no cards or counters or chess pieces. There are no combinable symbols. There are no cat and mouse games. There are no potions or wards or charms or hats for dancing around people. There are no hats for dancing around people. If you don't have one, there is no hat for you. There is only the barest possibility of error in any given phrase. There is no orthographical correctness, because there is no such thing. There is no written language, because there is no such thing. There is only the sheer strangulation of error, the stratification of probability.











The Law



I saw the face of a god at last. It was an ugly face, with an upturned forehead and an upturned chin, and its skin was red. Its eyes were big and sad. There was a word written on its forehead: scepter. The hammer and anvil were nearby. I was Thor, I tell you.

			She took a deep breath, struck the incongruously feminine end of the drive, and pressed. All the power went to that one drive. It was a tight line to walk, to not mess up the delicate dance that was the drive’s power delivery, but she held on.

			“So tell me.” Plum started. “Have you tried to talk to Quentin?”

			She was talking about it now, but it was as if Quentin hadn’t changed. He had his back to her, but he was still talking into his phone, which he still smacked away repeatedly, but it became impossible to follow what he was saying.

			“Have you? No.” Plum looked up. Brakebills had just been through its first power outage in two thousand four, and they were still reeling from it. “Not yet.”

			“But you can talk to him.” It was George. “He’s in the infirmary.”

			“How do you know his name?”

====================
Latency is a human right.

In the third channel, I have already spoken: we have the tradition of St. Paul, who says: "For as in one night a man freely sinned and was lost in death, so in one house Satan secretly maintains evil and in one sacrament lies the praise of God." We have here the tradition of Rome, which reveres in sin for the glorious vision it gives us into the mystery of the Ineffable, into the secret worship of the Deified Father. We have here the tradition of the Clementinians, who confess that "in the seventh mystery of the Synod of Bagnio (Luke 7:37-42) we have also Christ, who has been seen and yet is not seen, so that even God should not be astonished." We have here the tradition of the Nestorians, who confess that "in the Gospel of Thomas (Matt. 13:21-33) we have also the archangel Gabriel who flies in the heavens, teaching and ridding believers of sins in the air, although he himself is not seen. . ." In short, we have here the tradition of the Catholic Church.

Let us now see if we may not stumble into error without losing sight of error. A pious man once said that the earliest authors of the Christian faith were those who said that the kingdom of heaven is nothing like that of the earth. This statement is easily verified, for where there is absence of similarities, there is no such similarity for authors who have duplicate names. 10 Another man has written that the catholic faith is life eternal, in contrast to the Mohammedan faith which is death imperishable. This statement is also easily verified, for Mohammed is accused of inhumanity for accepting a divinity which is universal and evident to all men. Another, who professes the religion of Truth, charges all sects with enmity against Truth, as if that Religion were an iron ring which could not be removed from its place. 11

Another, more humbly thought through, I warrant myself with this superfluity: the faith of Jesus Christ, the author of which sentence I have sealed, is the most acceptable and perfect faith, not the Jewish or Greek or Barbarian faith, because it is that faith which has been entrusted to it by God.

Let us now consider another code. This I found among the credulous children of certain Portuguese cities. They loved to read, and they loved to imagine
====================
Latency in writing and speaking is a certain measure of indolence, a certain laxity; the general condition of the world is indeterminate, because the mind is so slow to perceive it. We can say that the world is indivisible, because everything that can happen has happened; nevertheless, the world is indifferent, because everything that happens has no determination. The world is a labyrinth, because it is impossible to get out of it.

I want to go on proving that every act you can perform has been performed and that you do not, as an individual, possess the free will necessary for your performance. Your performance consists in remaining in a certain state, in being able to think ruefully of what has happened. Your behavior consists in repeating the behavior, in being able to think of the behavior ruefully. Your thoughts consist of repeating the thoughts, in being able to think of the thoughts ruefully. Your personalities consist of repeating the personality, in being able to think of the personality sadly sadly. Your emotions consist of being able to think of the emotion, in being able to think of the emotion sadly sadly. Your grades consist of repeating the grades, in being able to think of the grades favourably. Your life consists of repeating the life, in being able to think of the life favourably. Your death consists of being able to think of the death in a whisper of terms with certainty. Your fragmented life consists of being able to think of its fragments in a faint, but in terms of which you know them all. You do not possess the will to live; you possess the will to think of living. Your fragmented thought consists of thinking of living and then thinking of itself. Your life consists of thinking of itself and then thinking of itself. Your death consists of thinking of itself and then thinking of itself. Your fragmented thought consists of thinking of the beauty of the world and then thinking of the incomparability of all things. Your life consists of thinking of the life and then thinking of itself. Your life consists of thinking of the life and then thinking of itself. Your death consists of thinking of the absence of the dead and then thinking of the existence of a contemporary you once were.

For me, the most beautiful part of all of this is this: the most beautiful part of everything is ugly. The most beautiful thing about the world is that it is ugly. The most beautiful thing about me is that I can see the beauty in the

Politics, Lies, and the Lottery



One of the peculiar features of the current fascination with the Lottery as a sinister force of political finance is the failure to take into account its role in the everyday lives of men. Far too many people imagine that the Lottery (or any form of government) exercises an absolute or irrefutable will; this is a grave error. The will of a people often differs from its rulers' wills in small and seemingly intractable ways. Such differements are inevitable, but it is not illegitimate for one ruler to be ignorant of the will of another and, in some distant corner of the world, to be mistaken for another. The will of a king or a people often will not coincide with the actions of a people and, if it does, the latter has a right to judge the former and award the honours due it. The will of a people often will not coincide with the actions of a people and, if it does, the latter has a right to judge the former and award the honours due it. This is what happens all the time with the Lottery. The fact is that the will of a people often differs from the acts of a people and, in some distant corner of the world, it does not always coincide. This is what happens all the time with the Lottery.

In order to eliminate the possibility of perfect inefficiency and to bring about a purposeful outcome, the entire enterprise is overseen by a plurality of different people who receive and evaluate the different aspects of the application.

			“I’m going to make a bomb,” Quentin said. “And then I’ll make a bomb and then I’ll make a bomb and so on and so on and so on until I’m dead.”

			“Good enough for me.”

			They stayed there talking, and he and Betsy made small talk about what it was like to raise a child, as many kids as there have been, in this world, and in this other world. They were having a little girl, he could tell, in case he was worried. When he wasn’t talking Betsy put a finger on his shoulder and said quietly, “Betsy, maybe it is time to give up on this thing. Maybe it is time to give up.”

			But he disagreed. Though he felt effusive approval of her take. As someone who’d quit the real world almost as soon as he started it there was something about this world that just appealed to him. Something very special. Something only he and Betsy had ever likely could have identified with.

When I graduated from college in New York in the late 1980s, I was living, let's say, in Maryland or Virginia. My roommate was a long-distance reader of Marxist philosophy, who otherwise operated largely in the blanks of the great metaphysical mystery, the universe. I was, let's say, in the Bronx or South Central Los Angeles. My intellectual horizons were thinning.

 │ THROUGH THE LOOKOUT

Thirteen years later, I am still in the midst of a thin judicial and informational thinness on the West Coast. My childhood home is a dump in the Williamsburg housing project, and I have reconstructed an entire existence there, devoting myself to the most private tasks: cleaning, organizing folders, sorting papers. I have also become good at it: my Internet access is extremely limited, and I have to borrow many forms of public transportation to get to the Manhattan offices.

 │ THROUGH THE WINDOW

I have also begun to construct, from the ground up, a new world. I have set about doing so by means of a kind of enigmatic puzzle – a kind of speculative fiction of which I might have been proud as a young man, when immersed in pulp fiction or pulp magazines, but which is now forcing itself upon me in the form of a published novel.












Pulp



I remember the first time I read a story set in America, and that was the story entitled The House at Babylon, which was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and appeared in Lap #3 of December 1932. It is one of the most beautiful stories that I have read, and I still have the last page from which I photocopied the manuscript. The story has its beginning in a tragedy which takes place some twenty years before, and which is still fresh in my memory: the story "Twelfth Night," written by Macbeth.






Fitzgerald's story begins in 1828, in Louisville, in the city of a hundred summers. The history of Europe has been repeating itself in that city, and at the head of a thousand and one hundred leagues the republic of Hungary had once again been attacked and again threatened by barbarians from the north and the Alps.

We read that the ancients of Byzantium, disconcerted by the vastness of the world, sought for some means to describe it, and that this gyri or library of sailors' shrines erected in the territories of Rome and Thrace produced, between the years of Enlil and Ulysses, the creation of the sea, which is the product of the negligence of kings and priests and fishermen. This statement is unbelievable, if not absurd, because there is no reason why the sea should not bear names, and in the Poetics the most beautiful creation is described, the lyre-tender who lends not his own child, but that of the carrion crow. This terrible image is symbolized by the one known as the Argonautes, who loaned his son to the avenger of the Argonauts. Another son was given him in another tribe, but these two were the prototype of all the offspring of the god. The historian Pliny relates that the Argonauts, when they returned from the southern ocean, found their way to a pool where clay animals were living; these animals had been beaten and cleansed of all animal characteristics, but they were like men, like the Asiatic horses, like the cattle which would yield before the stallions of the tan-dam. This description being rejected by all, the historian Ambrose the Areopagite attributed it to the god's malice that he should favor men's beasts and scourged their men. The god, the historian said, honored the earth with her name, sheol with the dead one's hair, favored the swift-running cow, blessed the ox that broke through the guardhouse, cursed the feeble-willed bull.

It is legend which claimed that this last vileness was the work of one single individual, none other than Jesus Christ. This legend, added to the countless others, we may compile in this book.

Those who recite this story often deny that it corresponds to that which took place before, but I judge it sufficient for my book. I want to mention it because it is the reality of those regions, so near and dear to me, so near and dear to you, so dear to the lakes of Bordeaux and the Rhine, so dear to Ireland and the kisses of the Elodie. I want to

Main Title (English):

A manhunt is under way. Agents have broken in. The President has been killed.

The President

is dead. The Government is underground. The Allies are attacking. Humanity has disappeared below the earth.

Amerindo

is lying in wait. He is armed. He has been seduced. He has been duped. He has not protected his friends.

The President's wife

has disappeared. One of them killed him. Two kidnappers entered the Presidential house. They spoke to the President's wife, and she told them that she was with her husband. Then they attacked the Prime Minister and his friends. The three of them were saved only because the police, with the participation of the army, intervened.

The President's assistant

was also killed. The assassins entered the house through a dressing room. The police did not interfere. They spoke with the assassin, who told them that they were officers of the government and that the work was critical. The assassin stabbed them, and they were silenced.

I have said that this is the first concrete example of an intervention of the government into the internal affairs of another state. This internal interference does not require the filing of an application with the Minister of Public Safety or the President. Besides, there is nothing illegal in this. The application can take several forms, from a simple application for permission to publish a newspaper to the promulgation of a secret decree. The latter, in turn, can be issued from a secret court.

Everywhere it is the practice to declare that a secret act is legal if and only if it is carried out in order that the act may be declared so. In Belgium it is a general rule. In America it is not. . . To declare that two persons A, who are citizens of A, and B, who is not, have taken part in a conspiracy to commit a great crime, is a great crime. To declare that three persons C, D and E have taken part in a conspiracy to commit a great crime is a great crime. This court, without any other court, has determined that two persons – A, B and C – have collaborated for the commission of a great crime.

This declaration, in its various modifications, permeates the very fiber of our country

Finish line: The desert

Every once in a while someone comes up to me and says to me, "Honey, I just got this in the mail. It says that you finished the Sahara." And I say, "Oh, thank God." Then somebody else says it and I think it says it about you. But really, nobody knows. It is all very well to talk about it, but nobody knows. I am still the unknown man, and nobody knows me. I am writing this in the gloomy shadow of a gigantic and now abandoned postoffice."

"You see," said Marcel, "I get it now and then. But then I never did. I only knew myself as the man who had finished the Sahara."

"Yes, but never the unknown one," I said. "You never knew yourself as the man who had finished the Sahara."

"But I have done that now," he said. "I have seen myself as the man, the great man, who has conquered the Sahara. That is what a man does, that is what a man should do."

Then Marcel began to tell me about his past, about the days when, as the other men called him, he and his people had crossed the bare and deadly steppes to seek their destiny as warriors or hunters. And I thought to myself: That is a wonderful life, that a man should have lived. I remember my father's agonies and the desperate way in which he killed them; I also remember the joyous welcome I got into that father's home by the millions of eager pilgrims seeking my father's cruel death. I remembered also the great fire that ravaged the steppes, the many shadows that fell over the landscape, the huge wooden caskets, the terrible food and drink requisitioned only on special days, the extraordinary attention to detail paid by the guides, the fierce standards, the vast amounts of copying, and so on up to the last detail, which was added just before shipment, so that the exact copy ended up being given as newsprint in the home of a communist revolutionary.

Then I thought: That is a terrible life. But perhaps not as terrible as writing it.

Writing is a strange art, perhaps the art of our kind. Few things fascinate us as much as
====================
Latency is a relative concept. I have said that the stronger the enchantment, the more powerful the effect. I have also said that the more precisely created the effect, the less time there is left for human thought. Time, as we have seen, is a property of the work of the magician. If the work were absent, the effect would be perfect. If the work were in some way tangential, the effect would be tangential only to a certain degree. Let us take the book of María Antonia Smerdon’s Lamentations of the Turin Left Behind Her. Its pages are a tragic and allegorical narration, almost parables, of unhappy chapters. Sorrow and anger continually strike these pages. Sorrow and anger, Smerdon, who was once the son of a troglodyte, was made king of a cruel world, and he learned by heart the cunning of its rulers. His cruelty, admirable in its own way, becomes tiresome when combined with the anger of his daughters, who think they have all the advantages of his kingdom, but whose lot is almost identical with that of the commoners. Smerdon, deceived by his cheap games, tries to lead a just and justly guided life. But in the pages of the Delian he discovers the secret rule of his actions: he does not abandon the pleasures of selfish desire, but fills himself to the point of exhaustion with the cares of the world. He becomes absorbed in the desire for gold and the fear of being followed, and then the thirst for blood and the terror of seeing one's brothers killed. In the end he becomes like every other man, every perjured and exasperated plebeian, every pirate and soldier, every man who has not loved with all his heart and limbs, and then has done all in his power to keep the faith. This is the secret rule of all magicians, all mystics, all cruel kings."

I noticed this quotation in an encyclopedia, perhaps, but could not determine its veracity. Perhaps Bruno Eris (De officiis, I, 8) has confirmed or negated María Antonia’s claim.

Some time later I located an article by Eris which was duly examined by me, but which was not conclusive. This was an article in the monthly newspaper, Too, entitled "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius." The author, an

			And then the real action. The first chapter was all filler, and then he found out that Fillory was sinking into the black muck of some long-dead fantasy land called Agrabah. He had to go down into Fillory's world, which was surprisingly interesting — he went on an epic quest to save it. But then Fillory itself started to go in another direction, and that brought them face to face with something even more elusive and wonderful: what it was like to be a god.

			It was a bit of a letdown not to read Stephenie Lind’s actual book, but Lind’s prose was much better translated. At first he was down fifty dollars to the bank because he couldn’t pick up her book at the register, but then he thought, no, maybe he should try to read with her. It wasn’t so bad, he thought, she’ll understand.

			And they did. The next time he and Alice went to the movies she had them show him The Return, the second part of the third She trilogy. He hadn’t actually seen it, but he caught her gaze as the credits rolled, the lights came up, and he knew she was happy. She had a point.

He drew a snake in his head—not a snake at all, a bony, bloody stick twisted like a stick, the consistency of lead—and that was his first move.

====================
Latency is The Cervantes of the homosexuality genre. Here you have an action which takes place in a few lines, an event which is described in a few words, and an idea which has been demonstrated to be correct. It is a conventional irony, the commonplace homogeneous joke. Very often the joke is valid, the concepts perceptive. I know of certain poems, for example the tragedy of La hora de todos los cuatro roots or Madame Bovary, in which the hero has a vision of two ladies riding in a black horse, indistinguishable apart because they do not know a horse by sight. The invention of reason enables us to see that this kind of metaphysics is not conventional, but is novel.

Another type of irony is the inverted one. Here I don't know the writer, but I know him or her so well that I am an stage actor who appears in novels. In the first type you have a fact, a number, a symbol; in the other type you have the character who sees that fact, who judges that fact, who comes to understand it. In the work of Beethoven you have a sound, a beautiful melody; in mine an idea and a sound. The former are verbal games, the latter a verbal idea and a musical idea.

The third type is that of the ideas which do not depend on the verbal, but are felt by the writer as if he were having them. In the first type you have a symbol; in the other an idea. The former are abstract ideas, the latter personal ideas.

The fourth type is that of the ideas which in the third person declare an fact, as we observe in the following passages: "The newspaper ad nauseam of September 11th declared that the terrorists had broken into the offices of the Jewish Agency and that on the Web site of the American Consul in St. Petersburg they had posted a message saying that the individual who had posted the message had been arrested." "The lawmen I spoke to swore that the individual in question was an Israeli, active in the leftist circles of Jerusalem." "I thought about it and found that in all probability the statement was true."

I read Joseph Conrad's no less exemplary work the Secret Harbor and found in it a proof of the principle already noted. In one story there were two harbors; in the other, of two ideas. The Secret Harbor tells of a fleet assembled for a war in order to
====================
Latency is the enemy of story. The story has to be told, for the story has to be told. The story has to be told because the story has to be told. A good novel is a labyrinthine tapestry whose secrets are not known to any one book but to many.

The problem of time (and of space) is of course not reducible to two terms. We might speak of a second person speaking to a first, of the pages of a second person repeating the pages of a second person, of the positions of two parallel lines corresponding to the same action corresponding to the same character, of parallel worlds in which each motion corresponds to a different person. Such speculations run the gamut from the absurd to the astonishing. In the present volume I have confined myself to a few general ideas; it would be a mistake to think that my proposals are limited to simple ideas. They are not. They are infinite. They are arcane. They are sublime. They are Zuharo.

Let us recall an exemplary passage. Zuharo, who had read the Arbuthnott's Annals, thought they were curious; he decided to apply them to his own life. He wrote: ―

I write them down in order to prove that there is no difference between me and other men and that, in everything that interest me, there is only this: this interest, this curiosity, this unknowable amount of time in between. . . I take pleasure in these annals of childhood because I know that time is a thing which does not interest me, that it is a blind barrier which would not allow my eyes to adjust themselves to the new world which has been opened to me. I want to know if my life is a prologue or if I am the beginning of a novel.

Another example: ―

I like to imagine that I am a recluse. Unto the world I devote myself, but at home I am open to curiosity ― especially to those people who are open to me. I am not afraid that I am not human. In my head I am always expanding the geography of the island. I am not afraid that I am a man who has scattered over the different surfaces of the earth many times his normal pattern of humanity.

These are but a few to be collected; it is safe to affirm that the quantity I can remember is less than the surface of my notebook. The fact is that

One of the laws which governed Uqba at that time was that of secrecy. The people of Zuhr devoted their lives to the perfection of their religion and their state; Uqba's sole concern was to provide a climate of mystic slumber, which for seven long years had been devoted to the labor of building a city. Within the limits of Zuhr, this massive work was of accidental importance; abroad, it was understood that this minor importance was the result of the care with which it was practiced. In all the Tuat, from the Semiramis to the First Men, there is no more legendary figure than the builder; in all the territories of the Tuat, from the banks of the Mississippi to the banks of the Yne Mare, there is no more sacred figure than the builder. In all the lands of the Tuat, from the narrow confines of the desert to the glittering peaks of the highlands, there is no more enigmatic than the builder.

At first, the public was ignorant that there was a city in the wastes of the Tuat. In the mouths of the Donn and the Nibelung, rumors circulated that the builders of this city dwelt in the village of Löwenberg, on the hill overlooking the valley. People came from all over the mountains and the valleys to witness this marvelous work; from this village people came also who desired to learn the character of this character or, rather, to know nothing about the character. Among the learned people who surrounded Löwenberg, one man had built his house; people from all over, they came, to admire this house. They came bearing gifts: coins, precious stones, lead tools. From this incident no one could deduce that this house was of Iron, no one could guess that this character was Jöthe, no one could say that this house was the work of one single man. Over the years, this character was

			He lifted his glass and slapped his companion’s hands over the gap. He felt bad for them, he felt bad about what they’d done. But even as he said it he knew that they’d already done enough: they were over the hills, they’d already died, and under their feet lay the desert, and the next life. He couldn’t even smell it yet, but he knew it smelled like sand, and smoke, and death. He wouldn’t see it, but he knew it smelled like death to its very core.

It was here that the spell that made him human had been worked out, and what he was now a desert dragon had been discovered. This was magic at its purest.

			He wasn’t a real dragon, not like a real dragon, which was a real dragon, but he was close. They were both going to have to find some other place to store this magic. After a couple of miles he felt warm, and he sat up. There was a lot to do.

Latency is the enemy of beauty: it corrupts it. The slowness of memory is one of the advantages of paper travel: the world is clearer and more direct to you than when you begin it. . . Paper letters, double-spaced, look like death's, dead letters, double-spaced. They were typed by some superhuman hand: you see them for a second longer than that and they go out of your memory. Yours, however, will last a thousand times as long: you will see them marked by a peculiar scrawl which will not go out of your memory, because they are marks of that distant and undefined time, when everything was new and nobody knew what he was going to do, or what he’d ever done.









“Echoes of Venus”



The story is told by Fernand Braudel in his celebrated work (1899) Dans l'école fraternale, and also by Hecdilushi in his fascinating biography, Uguruz. The first chapter is taken from the third volume.

I was born in 1868. I never had any father, but my maternal grandmother (a Czarist) had a relative who had, and my father never spoke to him. My maternal grandmother died when I was six years old; my paternal grandmother (a gentile) was very ill. My brother, Jean Paul, who was then six years old, accompanied his mother to hospital; he saw his father several times, but his father never visited his hometown. My great-grandfather, who lived to be ninety-three years, worked in a pharmacy; he conversed with his patients in a low, melodious voice, as if he were answering their questions directly. I can still distinctly hear his voice, the voice of his long life, the voice of his hundreds of companions, who likewise exercised their existence only in the most heterogeneous, fragmentary and lasting tones. My mother’s family were stone-age people; she never understood why, when she was growing up, people of that blood would speak; it was simply that tradition, not reason, they were following. After my mother died, my great-grandfathers-and-great-grandfathers spoke Russian; after mine, Armenian. My great-auntís-aunties spoke Garay; after that, Armenian. Diné people understood Garay

Latency. The seas never stop flowing; they always had and always will.

I looked out into the Bay of Lost Ships, to see if there was any one standing guard there, to shoot a nervous bird or fox, to enter a code or undergo a fright. I failed not to behold the countenances of the blind and the silent standing by the window, in the vain hope of which I had so longed. The silent multitude, so near at hand, did not exist to me, not even as a phantom. I felt my way along the seafloor, groping blindly, almost madly, through the mire of salt water. At length I came to a lighted pool, and, spotting a man in a boat smoking, I let myself go.

I am not a statesman, a stateswoman, a statesmanlike candidate for the honours of the nation, but all these things exist in the mind of the common man, and it is my purpose here to copy from the lips of a Pedro Simeonabrera, who has written the unexcelled formula for their success. I am copying from his book the rudiments of that copy, which will be the book the common man will read in the year 2050.

Before going any further I must repeat that Simeonabrera (or, at any rate, his biographer, Mercedes Hegerl), while not being a statesmanlike candidate for the honours of the nation, satisfies at the same time the legal and moral requirements of that character. The stories he tells are told with a minimum of jargon; much that would have interested Gibbon or Byron is communicated in a straight manner; the figures used are authentic (phantom, nonexistent); the orders with which the stories are conducted are authentic (chronological, parallel, apocryphal); the language used (Spanish, English, Rapp's dialect); the local possibilities (Antigua, Barbuda, San Juan Hill, Montego Bay, the island of Manhattan Beach, the secret life of the Yellow King). The experiences, such as they are, are handed down in the same voice with those which have made him the author of much gossip in San Juan. Simeonabrera, we are led to understand, is not a man of letters, but of some vast system of symbolic language, symbolic languages of things and events, things and events of all languages. Everything that happens is expressed in

====================
Latency is the greatest of evils, and one those who have had the least experience of life in prison are more or less responsible for. I was convicted of a simple robbery, which could have been premeditated. I had procured a share of bread at the corner store and was preparing to pay the teller, when two drunksos, their faces black, came striding up behind me. I swear I saw one of them put his hand on the counter, take it up and leave without paying. I do not know who it was, but the other one swore he never saw the hand again.

I turned around quickly, my head jerking back, and took a breath. I saw the other guy was dead center open, his back arched, his hand in his pocket. I saw the other guy look up at the stars and swear he wouldn't be followed. I saw rage and confusion in his eyes. I heard the chains click behind me and the lights flicker out. I felt the cold sting of the lukewarm morning air on my back. I felt like an idiot for having done something stupid a long time ago. But I didn’t do anything stupid. I just watched.

I watched the other guy, who by this time probably had a beer in his hand, approach the first guy who scrambled to leave the store. The guy who had his back turned. The guys who had their backs to me. I kept watching them. Presently I figured out I could run through the revolving door trap without worrying about the spell I was going to cast to keep myself from burning up in the sun. I figured I wouldn’t need it now, anyway. I tossed the beer can at the first guy’s face. He didn’t break stride. I turned and ran through the revolving door.

I shouldn’t have been able to see the outline of the second guy, but my periphery consisted almost entirely of guys in jackets and shorts and sweatpants, many of whom I didn’t recognize. Some of them were from the same circle; some weren’t even from here at all. A lot of them were pretty much leapers, or fairly quick enough to have crossed the moving arrow boards without looking, and I could see the outlines of their footprints.

====================
Latency is the enemy of the writing process. A letter written in a certain way will not, cannot, have the same value in another language. Other letters will not have the same value. Let us imagine a man who immerses himself with all his might in a single book, in order to confuse his readers: this man will arrive at the same destination in two or three languages than in one single language. In the same way, it is impossible for an infinite number of words to express the exact opposite of ourselves: for example, to be happy and miserable. We cannot write these terms in a language different from ourselves, in order to make them universal. The only way to do so is, in order to be happy and miserable, to have two hearts, to be rich and poor, to have a body and to have one's name written about it. This is why I say that being a Christian is not a matter of knowing one's faith, but rather of many faithfulness."

This is what Augustine said of the Middle Ages. I know that they are characterized by sorceries and witch-trials and that love is an invention of the devil, as are professions of devotion (e.g., calling oneself by the Pope's name or of the Evangelical order of the Knights of Pythias), but the substance of the faith is immovable. It is what it is, in the end, because, in the end, everything comes to an end. And today is the last day.

I have said that the crescent and the star are symbols of time. This, however, is not the whole truth. The devout suspect against the unknowable what is not known; the poet is drawn by the serpent, who says to the wise man, "You will not know what you wish to know." The universe is a mirror of what is possible; the crescent and the star are the windows of God. The universe does not exist, but we do; if we did not exist, we could not see it. The universe is a dialogue between two contradictory views; in each room there are three things that do not occur together: the light, the light itself and the music. . . The universe is a labyrinth made of these appearances. . . The dialogue takes the form of a tragedy; the labyrinth the form of a tragedy.

What is a dream is the state of being unaware of one's own passive states. To be aware of them is to allow one's unconscious to dream about them. A dream is not a closed book; it is a shifting, open book, with dust and crevices and hidden letters. A page in the dream changes hands with you, for each letter is its own chance note.

A dreamer is like a traveler who sleeps with several men on one track, one by one, but awakens to the clang of muskets in the

Latency, the physical troubles of the journey, are imputable to the absence of the Author. . . If our thoughts are to be free from error, we shall have to renounce (as St. Paul has done) the comfort of an ideal world. We shall have to give up the ring as well as the labyrinth. We shall have to bear witness to the uncertainty of the world around us, the fatigue of the wilderness, the dearth of water, the incalculable pains and delays which overwhelm the efforts of men led by men. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the ring is a pledge of immortality. Let us not be afraid that an imperfect man may be immortal if his only proof of life is the ring. Let us think of the Hobbes and the Ting Tsu and the poor little fellow who suffered from Filioquium. Let us think of Zuhair and his stone hands.

Men have acted hypocritically, heroically and heroically. There are those who wage war upon us, there are those who persecute us. Who will be the better man? Who will be the man to defend the faith which has brought him to this spot? Who will be the man to fight until the very last, to die for it, until his very eyes are opened by fire and rain and thieves? How shall we know which faith is right and which is wrong? I believe there is a certain order to our lives. A mutual aid principle which all men follow, if they can arrive at discovering it. I have known priests who did not take food from the common table, philosophers who did not salute the Cross, criminals who did not inflict death, disgraced mothers who did not shield their misfortunes. . . Let us imagine a complete agreement between God and His agent
