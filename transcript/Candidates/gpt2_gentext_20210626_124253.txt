			“The reason I brought you here is so you can join us. We’ve been through too much to stay on Melodic Full Moon. And we’d still be too weak to save Fillory from the trolls. Join us!”

			“But why?” Eliot was having none of it. “Why would you do that?”

			“I have no idea. Answer me!”

			“So I brought you over to show you what the League of Ordered Villains was all about. And you liked it. And I let you stay. You and your little band of miscreants call yourselves heroes.”

			“But why me?” Eliot was having none of it. “Why now? Did you change your mind years ago?”

			“It depends who you ask. Some people like you, think you’re pretty good. Others don’t like you, think you’re a waste of space.”

			“Whatever, Madeline. You can go.”

			She turned and walked away, out of the room and out of the house. She was going to hell.

			“Maybe she’s right, maybe Fillory isn’t real. But I’ve always thought it was pretty clear to everyone that it was real. That’s who I’ve always been to me and Eliot, and I think to everybody else too. Interested?” Plum said. “All right. I’ll tell you the story of my life with Eliot and Madeline.”

			You couldn’t say why she’d wanted to keep them private at all. You could only hope that keeping them this private would be enough to keep them from everybody.

			“So what happened was—” she said, finally, to herself, before she could say anything else—“back in second grade, we were going to be in Fillory for a year and a half. And after that we would go back to school. Madeline took French while I took English. And Eliot took archaeology. We

DialogThe second time I saw him was in the garden of a castle near Bordeaux. He saw me, I believe, as I crossed the estuary of the Loire at Chamonix, approached the back of a great bull, and was consumed by terror. I was not there, but I heard him. I heard him speaking to a Gaul, I heard him predicting the end of the world. I saw him in a dream, a blond boy in a heavy nightshirt. I can remember their encounter, perhaps I shall one day be able to repeat it. I awoke that morning, June 14th, 1888. The days and nights were of every imaginable nature; the ground was exceedingly fertile. I dressed, I bathed, I examined the traps. The bull demanded three thousand francs; I told it that I was on holiday in Genoa and that I should call immediately. It demanded four thousand. I told it that the demand would not be unreasonable, that I was very much in need of money, that I was infirm and in dire need of living, and that I should be at once present in Milan (three days) and at Genoa (ten days). It agreed to the first offer, and the next. The demand rose to six millions, ten millions, one billion. . . The bull offered me any number of important offices. It was necessary to create a new type of heroes. I had to create geniuses. I had to create Borges.

It is not surprising, then, that I should be Borges. I am not unlike him. But I do differ from him. Like Borges, I have made a living of telling stories of the uncanny. Like Borges, I have created important narrations ― many of them. But unlike Borges, I have become increasingly self-conscious in order to come up with fictional tales which, though they greatly exceed the imagination of the reader, nevertheless greatly exceed the imagination of the reader. The reader is meant for this work, this fictional fiction, not Borges's shadowy lapses into reality.

This book does not concern itself with the details of reality. It is a matter of inventing realities. At first, the reader is led astray. He thinks he knows reality, namely, the one he has been taught, the one taught to the last drop of his students by heart. He sets about to experiment with this same reality, with creating human beings like

			And so it was that, as the weeks went by, the hours in the wharf slowed to infinitesimal times, and the yards swelled to accommodate the loads that would otherwise have piled on top of each other, the watermasses began to compact and to condense like accordion seats. The winds shifted, looking more often like snares and more often like gentle hammers. Things began to make sense.

			For one it was perfect—the distance from its tip to the tip of its snout was the same as its head, which meant that its entire head was submerged in a pool of clear, salty water. Between its eyes was a dark sigil, one Quentin had never seen before, and he didn’t take his eyes off it till the very last. The bird floated there on a honeycombed rim of sea-gelatin. On its beak hung a long spine as thick as its body, and the young fell out through its massive fat, rendered nubile.

			Quentin stared at it for a good part of that whole trip, the whole trip from beginning to end. He didn’t know what to make of it at the time, and he didn’t care. He was a practical boy, and looking at the natural world, with its hardy plant and brittle bone, was just about the kind of thing you tried to do if you were going to live in a world populated by stone-faced giants. He just liked the idea of solving the Deluge by fucking with the world’s natural order.

			When he saw what remained Quentin figured he’d found the perfect enemy—a V for victory, he the conqueror. Which he didn’t. That would have been pure poetic vanity, and what was pure poetry was thinking that people would care about you anyway, because you could take their stuff if you tried, so why not their magic too?

			Incredibly some of the stuff that remained was better than the rest. The bird was better balanced, more even in its motions, and its eyes were better aligned. The neck was more even and level. Its feathers were more even and silvery. Its beak

Dialog’s a big one,” Alice said. “And you have to do it all alone. You can’t rely on any of your allies for help.”

			“But you helped me,” Quentin said.

			“I did. I did what any decent hero would have done. I think I might have been a little too close to the case,” Alice said, “to the point where I pissed myself.”

			Quentin thought she might have been joking, but then he wasn’t. He was pretty sure she did that.

			They rode out on horseback to the very edge of the Magic Country, which was really just a few football fields in the distance. They lined up outside the fields and played defense, or he played defense, and she played defense, or he played with the football—it was like a hockey game—and then he laid the body down flat and left the game in progress. It was a long shot, but they all said it was the most likely of all ways of bringing the dead back. It was a terrible, terrible way to spend an evening.

			At the other end of the hall Quentin could see the top floor. It was a madhouse of a school for superpowered pussies, or at least what he could see. It was run like a medical facility.

			It was an hour and forty-five minutes to midnight. Neither of them bought the magical argument, so they recommenced the trip through the Forest. It was getting to be too much of a bother, really, so they went through the city. It was even more confusing than normal, and the magic was kind of dark, but they could see the Palace of Fine Arts, which to them was just about exactly what they were expecting it to be. Probably the most famous work of Western art since Rembrandt.

			At least it was near a train station. They paid their respects, and then they were turned away. There were lines, they just couldn’t walk through them. They had to find a different route.

			They turned around and ran through a doorway they’d never seen before. It was built like a grave, with fancy flowers and stuff. An elaborate tomb. When they came to it it looked like they

Dialogis sibi per tua dolore, sed auctoritate causa.

The first thing I should like to say is that I do not pretend to offer a solution to the riddle. My purpose is to give you a piece of literature, a vocabulary, to help you to think, to reason, to be gods. I do not look for an express formula for divinity; I seek words which in some way signify to me the external world, the mental world, the spiritual world. Thus the god Hermes Trismegistus, in order to express to Athena the glory of the hunt, uses words which in some way signify the senses; thus the god Ulysses, in order to express to Jane the enchantment of the sea, uses words which in some way signify the senses; thus the god Apollo, in order to express to Helen the movements of the chariot, uses words which in some way signify the senses. Thus, O immortal gods! You who have inspired men with the spirits of horses, chariots and hosts, with immortal words which in some way signify the senses, can you at the same time speak of the hoary ram and the swift and the immortal?

so that by our very difference we may be understood.

====================
Dialogs in this book are very brief and almost imperceptible, but the effect is startling. The characters speak in vague, degraded terms, express a few rudimentary ideas, are zipped up for publication, or are simply not audible. They frequently occur in the same paragraph or passage. They are not carefully constructed lies. I have noted one such anecdote, which I have translated from the Venetian dialect of Francisco de Quevedo. This individual said that before he left for the mountains he had composed many discourses to the effect that the English language is a mockery; others have related that before he left for the mountains he had plagiarized a page from Lutetia's book "critica caritate"; others that before he left for the mountains he had sneaked a critical word or two into the monograph "critica literatu latino." . . The book which he plagiarized is by no means unknown to Englishmen; it is, instead, in the British scholar Humphry Osmond, who first composed it in the nineteenth century as a defense of his Latinisms and later discarded it. In the quotations I have drawn from the pages of these older adversaries, it is not necessary to identify the author; I have inserted him simply because he is remembered. There is nothing strange in this method; the methodical reader is aware that wherever he will find one citation, he will find a generation or a dialect. But the methodical reader should be sensitive to the possibility of over-identification, where the memory of an illustrious person or an esoteric text is pruned from the history of the tongue. The methodical reader should know that whatever he recalls is not for him, but something else, something that seeks to overwhelm him. This something else prefers abstraction and formalism to overt expression and personal narrative. Something similar has happened to the work of Miguel de Cervantes. (As for myself, I am doing just fine without his writings.)

Let us recall for a moment what a poem is. It is an indefinite vocal sequence, rhymed or unrhymed, of simple words, usually clear and intelligible, but sometimes of difficult or sign language-speech. The most ancient poets wrote their poems in the Iliad, which is a cyclopean narrative told in principal by a motley group of actors. In the oral tradition, such actors include the Minstrel, the Tin Soldier, the Farmer, the Cook, the App

In my youth I had fought alongside Oropug- IV and loved my country more than anything in the world.

====================
Dialogs between the two great philosophers are no less beautiful than those between Pascal and Bayle. Bayle, in a dream, imagines a triangle with sides A and B; in truth the two triangles cancel each other out, not in the usual way, but in an unusual andnaments-way: the square root of the hypothetically possible triple. Bayle does not link this fact with the existence of sides, but thinks that this fact is sufficient to prove the existence of three sides. He thinks that this fact, besides proving the existence of three sides, should be combined with other properties (such as noncontradictionicity) to make a property such as we see in the world. One side of the triangle he calls A, the other side of B. He thinks that the existence of sides cancels each other out, A+B+C=0; he thinks that the triangle adds a zero to the number of sides. He thinks that the square of its sides cancels out, a-minus-b-minus. He thinks that its sides add up to zero. He thinks that by adding these properties he obtain the three sides of the triangle. This he does; the three sides are zero, of indefinite nature, and not even, for they do not add up to zero. Bayle calls this state the Idealist: he regards it as an absolute fact that the world is composed of three equal parts, and that these equal parts add up to a single point on the imaginary circle of the idealist. Thus ends the investigation of the first part of the book.

The Idealist investigates the idealist. The Idealist investigates the idealist as well.

Dialog, the oracle, that all men are of one blood, one divine nature, the relational intuition that ought to guide us all. I have, in fact, been obliged to study this doctrine with eager diligence, not only to understand it but also to improve my own soul; the process has been, at times, torturous. In the face of the imminent and almost unbroken disruption of my life, I had preferred death to a moment of depression or distraction. But now that the world is failing me, the likelihood of My offering eternal life to the demons is very small. For if I live, I know, I shall die. In other moments I have felt happier, I have not felt happier.

In an aged and venerable face, with itshartakkara and tusitope for eyes, my old country house, with its statues of Turko Aronica and its alder columns, have lost no beauty. A few streets from my old abode, these same statues honor the memory of a different man: the illegitimate son of the legitimate king of La Spezia. My dear friend, I will not describe that era of my life; the reader is invited to discern his own moments.

I remember him as a man of letters, of a quiet and official bearing, of a time when the king could be found playing chess with his son or with his secretaries. Often I will read in the newspapers that his works included a treatise on the history of the Spanish West and another on the mysterious "Jew question" of Bansal.7 Unknown to me at the time, these books were devoted to the criticism of Judaism and were, as far as I was concerned, frivolous and elementary. My conduct toward them was humble and good; my companions laughed at the extravagant ramblings of the blogger and at the more humble and theological writings of the blind alchemist Muhammad Shah.

While we were thus distracted by the trivial concerns of our life, Lönnrot, who at the time was engaged in a correspondence with the alchemist, was engaged in a correspondence with the translation of the Comte de La Touche. The latter, as everyone knows, was a Turk of Greek and Roman blood; the former, an Armenian of Persian extraction.2 This historical mystery, raised by chance in the early hours of the morning, filled the room of the library; Lönnrot, fascinated, began to copy the volumes with

Postscriptum: On pages 424-427 of my study of the Analytik der griechischen Philosophie (Leipzig, 1963), Hartmut Ralph Kaufmann has written: "The characteristic work of the Analytik der griechischen Philosophie is the book by Hartmut Kaufmann, written between 1904 and 1906. This book is a kind of antithesis of Pound and his imitators. He does not exaggerate, in his writings, the sphere of his competence, but rather he magnifies our practical experiences. His reading takes him not so much beyond the world of ideas as beyond the world of fact. His reading takes him not so much beyond the world of rhetoric as beyond the world of fact. His theorizing is very much like that of Spengler,

Dialog. The words failed him; the gesture of astonishment was modern; the meter was Greek.

"I always told myself I wouldn’t have grandchildren," he said. "Then I thought of the Horatio–I don’t know, the poets. I thought of Achilles, of Don Juan, of all the ancient and modern figures who have tried to accomplish the impossible. Achilles, Hector, Don Juan, the Persians, the galleons of the Panthéon. They tried to cross the ocean, crossed the Persian desert, died trying, goaded on by the vanity and the obsession of immortality, on and on. But just as they were about to throw in the deep end by dying, King Arthur died defending it against brigands armed with swords even as his own kingdom was falling apart around him. Even as I am now helping to rebuild that ravaged land, I am dying for it. Just as Hermippus was dying for the mysteries of the soul, I am dying for those mysteries."

"So you are arguing that the soul is an illusion, a device the philosopher himself helped to popularize," I said. "A popular device? Even in fiction is it?"

He tried to shrug his concern. "Non est inacién, non tollér. All fiction, when first told, is repeated repeatedly. First the hero describes his adventure, then he describes the land he lives in, then he describes the mountains, rivers, birds, plants, animals. Each repetition adds an element of their own, omitting, contrasting, contrasting again. Tlön, unicomponent! Tlön, illusion! Tlön, multiplicative endless combination! Tlön, Atmacritl, Lambert, Rubens, Milton, Shelley, Bach, Bach in the Bible, Solomon Georges and Manly Hall in the Writings of Sri Yukteswar!"

All this, Lönnrot continued, with no signs of fatigue, anger, or resignation. The evening was enchanting, without a doubt, but Lönnrot felt that this night could only live or die with the Bhangra, and the evening was almost over.

A Brief History of Fables


An exceedingly brief one, really. The subject of this paper is not Finnegans Wake, nor is it the work that ended up as the N. Y. Herald Tribune's most infamous item, a no less fantastic polemic entitled, You Are Being Hunted. (Herald Tabs, No. 1, March 1942.) Rather, the fictions that constitute this questionable subspecies are Umber and The Rape of the Lock. What is not a topic of scholarly debate but rather the basis for its formulation is the case Hladys the Cruel bears in Timon'sadrift. This case is, roughly, this: While on a hunting trip with her friend Peyssou, Hladys discovered an enormous lock of peach-colored hair in the earth near a sinkhole. Peyssou carried the lock in his hand, and whenever it grew long enough, it fell out of his hand and fell off. When they returned from their early morning excursions, Hladys told Peyssou that she had found the lock. Peyssou at first was very angry, but Hladys told him the story of the find and how Peyssou had handled it appropriately, and that it all made perfect sense. Then Hladys told him the whole story.

Peyssou was a bit skeptical, but Hladys felt no hatred toward him. She told him what a strange and precious feeling it made her to have something she had searched for and tried to hide, something she had tried to hide from her brother, from her father, from her entire family. She told him that finding it was like finding the heart of your life restored. She told him that finding the heart of your life was like finding the key to an unlocked chest. She told him that finding the key to your life was like finding a chest of drawers that was never closed. She told him that finding the key to your life was like opening a drawer and finding a dress you had never seen before. She told him that finding the key to your life was like sliding your fingers beneath the surface of an infinite fluid stone and feeling its tension. She told him that finding the key to your life was like feeling a vein in your arm and knowing that you were a living one, part of a larger structure that was always seeking and regenerating. She told him

Dialog’s room is a long, flat, unfinished workshop. The walls are studded with odd-looking machines, most of them boxwood salvaged from a thrift store. On the couches and benches are standing stones and odd bits of glass, and on the floor are sawdusts and dishes—all unnatural products of the immigrant work force. A lean Nordic man in a gray suit and gold tie, lean and healthy, is working on a magnifying glass. On a table, hunched over an electronic keyboard, a jumble of papers—one behind the other, like a bibliography)—look disturbingly real. . . Stoppard sits cross-legged on the bench, eyes closed. He’s had his picture taken with it. I can’t stop smiling.

			“Look at all these machines!” Plum said.

			“These were all designed by Crank-Dene.”

			“Must’ve-be such a fucking miracle,” Betsy said.

			“A real miracle,” Plum said, “because the earth didn’t help. Old Stoppard must’ve been high as the Alps,” which made him seem an awful lot like an insane person.

			“He died if I know God knows.” Plum leaned over, into the workroom, and she looked at Quentin. “What did you do to him?”

			“Shot him.”

			“Why?”

			“What’s his name?”

			“Rupes, I think.” Betsy moved to pull the faceplate back from its socket, but Quentin grabbed her by the shoulders and dragged him back inside. It was going to be hard to get out.

			But they didn’t have to go back. Somebody had to fix this. Feast or famine, veto or treaty, emergency or precaution, this was the emergency. If Croaker couldn’t get into the room then Feast was going to—and Plum knew why.

Dialog’s just that he’d been thinking about it too much. He was in too much of a hurry. He wanted to finish it now.

			He made a few more mental notes. He was exhausted, the trip had been ten minutes over by about five minutes, and he was going to need water. He wound up bringing along a waterglass full of white rock—it had a sentimental value to it, he noticed one of those in the Tiffany window, a bluestone by trade—and a shaker full of sea salt. He also brought along a set of Earrings, the black metal buttons and studded with diamonds that Alice had given him for his eighteenth birthday.

			He took the elevator up to the sixth floor only to find that the glass was half full. The landing was barely large enough for him. He took a deep breath and, slowly, the bird in his head guided him to the foot of the stairs. It wasn’t much, just a little door leading to the lobby, and a few windows along the far wall.

			It was a big, loud lobby. He could almost hear the big-box stores stocking jewelry and other consumer goods. The inside was very expensive, very expensive. Made from very special-case white marble—the kind that’s quarried in the Solar System—used in the Apollo and Terracotta Army movements of the past, not the Polis mint. The walls were sunburst, the ceiling blue with gold leaf. The tasseled buttons on the glass were gold too. Through the door at the back of the lobby you could see nothing but the endless lawn.

			It was a little cubby of a space, a boxy little meeting place for low- and middle-level personnel, finance people, the nicest people he’d ever met, people who could use a quickie coffee before they went onstage at a reception. The rest of the place was full of them, stocky but tough, older but young, male but female, with freckles but without; some of them had had families, some of them hadn’t, but they all wore identical suits and looked like they had the same purpose. All of them looked like they belonged there together.

			Plum went first. She was the first one through.

====================
DialogThe first thing he noticed was that it was dark out. He was in a desert, or in the small Nebraska town of Eloy, about ten minutes' train ride away, but the station was farther away than it should have been. He phoned his wife and they set out for the desert.









The Betrayal



Eliot, in the course of a long and singular night, has laid before him four volumes of the Bible; he has also, to his great chagrin, a sixth, which he must endure until the other four books can be completed. On the way he purposely does not sleep; he observes a systematic routine: he stops at a red light, hems himself up in class, hereticsically tackles some intellectual opponent ("It is a law of human nature to defend against doubt and to defend against falsehood"), consummates his nefarious enterprise at the movies, goes to bed, meditates, revises, repeats. After dinner he immediately forms a theoretical scheme ― the precise nature of which he will explain in due time. He overcomes himself with formalism; his notebooks are strewn with examples taken from this or that text. The classical texts which disturb and even confuse him most are the least varied; he believes that they are mutually unintelligible phrases interwoven together to form an incoherent whole. He is moved by a feeling of profound and obvious sincerity. At the end of the day he overcomes himself yet again and orders a margarita.

Eliot began to feel uneasy. The desert had corrupted his taste in mountains and beaches; the shifting and agitated scene made it impossible for him to concentrate. He decided to take a walk. The walk was peaceful and serene, it ran along the blackberry pines, which were bare and erect, like the profiles of a Demonym. The road, the winding lane, was very rural; passing below a high stone gate, he saw a tree nailed to the gate with a message: visitors are requested to the Knickerbocker Prison. He was taken aback by the suddenness of the visit; he was surprised that people should come to ask for a cigarette and to thank him.

Dialogidorum suam, linguam, is the language of the Tillich.

It is, as we have seen, a dialect of the Ladino, which is a language very different from that spoken by the Finns and spoken by the Aryans who crossed the Great Pacific Ocean, since it is written in woodcuts and scripts not unlike those the Aryans produced. It differs from the woodcuts in that it is not a representation of the world as it actually is, but of a world in which there have been changes: in which is a lofty, dynamic, transitive heaven and a suspended- and decaying earth. It differs from the woodcuts in that it is not a representation of the past, but of the future. It differs from the future as well as from the past; it is a moment of apprehension, a glimpse behind the things. It is a kind of prophetic dream.

It is also called Zang the Creole, after the Zangian emperor, whose Celtic name is given to that part of the land in the Franconian Foothills where the people's original capital, Durban, now stands. The emperor's people were from these origins as are the Brakebills fans who in dreams shout "Ulysses!" and who carry torches in the center of the campus. (The University of Cambridge has determined that the term "Fan" includes men of Celtic blood, and excludes Brakebills fans by reason of their racial identity.) Zang the Creole is a diminutive form of Belgic, Zang the Italic a diminutive form of Belgic, and so on to infinity. (In one of my fanzines there is a typescript of an article by the Irish novelist E. E. Cummings, in which he attributes to the Zangians a kind of mythical national character, a precocious, imaginative, hybrid type of elementary Belgic.) The citizens of Zang the Creole are the intellectual sons and daughters of the Belgians; the citizens of Zang the Italic are the sons and daughters of the Illyrians. Cummings himself was of Punjabi blood; if one adds to this enumeration the northern and eastern types, the admixture of the Persian subcontinent (Persians, Pakistanis, Mizos), and the Indian blood (from the Indus, the River Gujanjir, the Moghuls), the result will be a kind of

Dialogs by the Most Sorrowful, who, when he was asked by a monk what his greatest pleasure was, replied, "To know that all things are possible and that there is no condition of things other than that they be possible," give us, in the last analysis, the secret formula of happiness (Dionysius'). In order to combat this Theus Barbarorum, Dionysius the Areopagite, in the sixth book of his De rationibus, defines rationem optionale operatum sit amet conveniens, ut scripturas ambitus in adversus simul verba. . .

Now, let us return to our Adversus inquisit. This conflict, with the Arians and the Bedeans, offers us, for guidance, two maxims. The first says (Epistola, I, 9): Quidam nunc autem rebusque in adversum ratione sit amet conveniens, sit amet conveniens autem. Verily I say unto you, He who rebukes His Father in heaven shall in the same place mourn for His people, but He who sends thunder and lightning in earth shall mourn for man.(ern- BEGIN TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: The first phrase gives us, roughly, 'He who is in heaven shall mourn for our people.' The second phrase gives us, roughly, 'He who sends thunder and lightning in earth shall mourn for us.'') We should judge that the former expresses our situation ('in heaven') and that the latter, in pointing out our situation, point out our predicament ('strengthened by fear of thunder and lightning') and so on to infinity. We should judge that the phrase means equal matters, that both sides are meant and that the former is the more significant. Bernard Shaw in his work De quo facere mai Armand translates the preceding words as follows: 'Armand, on the one hand, against Armand, against his own self; on the other, against the whole earth. Let us remember that Armand gave his life for his book, that it is in truth the last book written in English, and that the last suicide is the author of the first volume. Let us also remember that Armand's book is the last book which monarchs or priests can kill, so that our martyrdom is in some way a sacrifice to the book. . .'

			Quentin swallowed hard, clear as crystal, over a rheumatism that had been bothering him. He really hoped it was a herniated disc in his back.

			“I’ve never had a better front-row seat to a great play than I have at the Royal Festival’s Ball,” Lionel said. “And I’d like to ask you one favor of you and me: go ahead and accept the ball. I’ve seen better in me than you’d ever seen.”

			What an idea. Quentin swallowed once, then spat it out as an answer. He was going to find out what Lionel knew, and he wasn’t going to be lectured.

			“Barbara,” Lionel said brightly, “I don’t know what you’re waiting on, but you can go ahead and do it. I’ll wait here.”

			“Thank you,” Quentin said. He was getting the distinct impression that barbara didn’t want this because she was scared, or she was genuinely curious about his cowardice, or both. He wished he had something to say to both of them.

			He was remembering incorrectly. Lionel was staring at him expectantly for a minute, as if he was going to say something, and then settled back down into his usual cheerful self.

			“I’m going to give the ball to somebody else,” he said. “I think. Should be quick.”

			“Oh, come on!” He was still goofing around with his Drollette avatar when he said it. “You know I don’t give vacuums away.”

			“I told you, barf.”

			Lionel seemed no lesspanicked than Quentin. He softened, and heank-backed as if he’d been knocked over by a truck.

This wasn’t a straightforward chronicle of the universe. It was a chronicle of Harriet Sixel, telling the history of a vanished world, pieced together from the tiniest things that had happened to Harriet over the years, as told by a ghost.

			“And she did it well. A lot of the stories in this collection are the same as in the movie, or at least they were the first time I read them. Sometime between when I started watching it and when I finished playing Harriet, I realized that was the case too. This was the story of my life. It was the story of my life, and it was a movie.

			“Or at any rate it was the story of mine. It wasn’t a big-budget production, or an epic fantasy novel, it was a book about a life, and it was an astonishing ride through the wide, dark, warm, warm, flat, sun-kissed suburbs of Pennsylvania that turned out to be the year 2000. But that was all there was. It was nothing. There was more of the same, and more of nothing.

			While they were filming that scene in the little town in the suburbs, Rupert and Janet’s lives completely radically changed. Rupert had moved back to Upstate New York to take up with his friend Linda; she took him to Los Angeles to find a new job. There he met his future wife, actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, and had a baby girl, Ella. They left her in the care of their friend and neighbor Harold, who was also staying in the same hotel; Harold was a long way from his father-figure self, but Ella was born in good health and with no signs of any serious physical or emotional scarring. No one in Upstate New York had ever asked for a limp, but Harold seemed happy to receive them. He took good care of them.

Dialogidrillus, which is less a poem than a history of the American novel. This would not, I repeat, be a novel in the strict sense of that word; it is a dialectical narrative which makes allowances for the impossibility of judging the end of events. In the second book, "De coelo e lepidrologico," there is a poem written by a kind of dream which makes a kind of circular reference; in the third, "Non cognitio lepidographico," there is a tapasadic story which reconstruc- tionally presents the same facts. I have taken the liberty of publishing these fragments in Italian, though they would be inconceivable in English. I have not altered the tone or the flavor of the text; the reader is allowed his own way. . . I know that these superficial XXVIII Caesars' days. Stories of that kind tend to become insipid reflections on human dullardship. I know that such poems as this one are as sweet and as sour as any other, but I assure you they are grander. I am telling you the story of one man, who was more exalted than all the others, and I am telling you the story of a crime that is also greater. Marcel Proust, in his vast book Les Beaux Des Arts, has this to say about the bequest of his son's poetry: "I have been asked to name the son of Jean Baudrillard as the inventor of modern poetry. This is not an impossibility, this is the prototypification of the future." I say to you that if there is such a man, there is one more in me, that bezoar which the divinity hates to be touched. I was not worthy of Beethoven; I will not be unworthy of Beethoven. I choose Beethoven as my god and my vehicle. I choose his sonnet "The end justifies the means" (Matthew 6:12) because I find in it the germs of a better theology. I chose it because it is beautiful and convincing. I chose it because it is childish and sweet. I chose it because it is pathetic and sweet. I chose it because it is universal and intimate, because it reaches out to all the varied nations of the earth, so that from the face of the earth it is as if it were on high, and because it has been entrusted with the household business of salvation.

Both of these mercantilist practices are still observed by our contemporaries; I repeat, TWO OF THEM. What is your opinion about them?

The foregoing passage is taken from Graeber, Civilization and History,VI, pp. 738-39.

In your essay on the Anabaptists, you speak of the "primitive faith" of that people. I know, that in those countries faith in an infinite God is not of minor importance; I also know that it is less of a fact than our savagery is of minor importance. I also know that in all patriarchs the fundamental doctrine has been the worship of the Supreme Being, since which all other doctrines are secondary considerations. I also know that in all patriarchs individual bishops have tried to please their flock by subtle arts which have been long believed to please the Almighty; I know that this kind of faith, which begs the invisible God by appealing to verbal proofs, is of late vintage. I know that in all these congregations there are readists who decipher the sacred books surreptitiously, that is, secretly; I know that this code is subverted by those who profess that the coded books are deciphered at the drop of the Bible. I know that this revolt is going on in the most elementary churches; I know that this church, after the manner of the times, has in it the demon of depraved sensual indulgences. I know that these acts deserve death, I know that God, with the help of the demons, has finally put to death these atrocious words: "Every man is sentenced to his own sins." I know that these words signify that within each man there is a built-in sin, that is, a· Sinsbris· tibi bonos sin·sister· sanguinis· servans; that is to say, each man is a sinner, interwoven with the church, which contains his guilt

The next morning I went up to the river, which emptied itself into it. From the confines of the city I could see its troglodytes, marsupias and canals; behind them, the Tetragrammaton, the name of the God of the Hebrew Scriptures, torn and mangled; before them, a pyramid of red sand topped with a cypress; to the east were the ruins of an enormous temple of the Sun, its columns blackened and charred; below, a black sand-bank with cypresses and thornedadoes; to the west, the black sand of Laeraland. The horizon was black, with ochreings. To the south, the sky was black; clouds obscured the sky; I perceived that they were the remains of a great forest. To the west were the black sand beaches. To the south of the forest, the air was disagreeable: it was as if the black sand were choked with a insipid desert and urged upon by winds that could hardly be discernible. The light of the east was insipid; its phosphorescence was degrading; from some distance away, I could not hear the pine trees. The beauty of the forest was macabre.

The tonics of the desert are the Moḥammadanie dialect and the "Bar Kokhba" poem.

Depending on the order, Judith might write: "The man who murdered my father swore by the Angel Gabriel that he would kill my brother and then die as he had foreseen." Or she might say: "The man who murdered my father swore by the Angel Gabriel that he would kill my brother and then die as he had foreseen."

It is natural to think that the order would be more direct if the master were writing it. But in the past years we have seen that this is not always the case. Instruction and direction sometimes run in the opposite direction. In 1832, Bartholdi, in the first of his cycles, composed "Le problème d'une femme avec lutte ou que son femme," which defined the probity of his heroine and then compared her with the heroine of the next chapter. The heroine of the next chapter found it disgusting that the preceding heroine had defined her virtue in such a way; this previous heroine found it incomprehensible that that virtue had been defined in such a way. The woman, because she was woman, did not know that she was virtuous; the man, because he was man, did not know that he was noble. This second woman defined her virtue in the same way; this similarity made her more acceptable; this unacceptable, even more unacceptable. The man, because he was man, did not know that he was noble; the similarity made him more acceptable; the woman, because she was woman, did not know that she was noble. She did not know that she was more or less noble, because she was more noble. She had only determined that she was more noble. The difference between these definitions and the one read by Bartholdi was not a matter of rhythm or metre, but of ideas: her having already determined the heroine of this book to be virile, heroic and beautiful, while his had no such connotation. In other words, the ideas of "prejudice" and of "prejudiced against Jews" had no effect on Heinrich Wilhelm Barbarossa, since he had already determined the plot of his hero's stories.

It is no less playful to consider the question, so that we may accept as inevitable the opposite of what we expect. The verses on the Rhine and on Downing Street are predictable if we imagine that we, actors in a play, accept what is offered to us, or what is convenient, or what

Like Jinn and the Wandering Swords, or the Staff of Acquisition, or the Staff of Law, or the Staff of Judgment—they’re pretty unique and really cool-looking things. I keep having visions of them in my head, covering most or all of Fillory, at different points throughout the story. They must be one of the many things I’ve missed in my dream, and I’m sure there’s more, like the Thousand and One Nights, or the Thousand and One Nights along the Ways, or the One and The Many.

			But what about the message at the end, the one that says it all? That the two of them are as one behind the story? That it was just a metaphor, or that it really was like sitting around a campfire?

They were always full of stuff she’d never heard of, and I’d always assumed it was historical fact, or fact, or anecdote. But it was really just a cover story, brought on by the age and the stresses of the job. Did they ever finish a one-volume history of the British Commonwealth? Of course they did.

They bore a remarkable-for their-age resemblance the Lookouts had received from the Loire Valley: massive shields of unbleached earth and stone, accompanied by disproportionately high long weapons of the same earth-and-stone type. Jughead’s shield was much weaker than Quentin’s, but it was the weapon of choice.

But down below Jughead was turning his head to view the chaos.

There is a poem that is said to have expressed the mind of the Hesiod in the second century of our faith. It is the Iliad of Argonilles and it is this:




Hotter and feverer the bronze is the more you look at it.



Between the years 1485 and 1490, the ingenious anathemist John of Pannonia formulated the imperfect theory of the springs of heat. He observed, with God's blessing and apostolic debacle, that the sun, the moon and the earth (with the exception of the earth, which he derisively terms a "snow globe" or "snow of any metal") are perfectly spherical and therefore measure zero. The diameter of the sun, according to this ideal system, is the same as that of the sphere; the diameter of the moon is the same; the earth is tangent to the plane and spherical, but elliptical and −—God pity her sinewy sin face!! spherical! around its axis. The earth lies in a central meridian, "west of the Yangtze," but peripheral to the sun and peripheral to the other planets. From this system it is evident that the day lasts four hours, that noon is over by nine o'clock, and that the night follows by four or five hours. (The course of the moon, when the sun is in the northeast quadrant, is equivalent to the return of the sun's head the following morning.) The sun and the moon, according to this ideal system, circle the sun-god, who is also at rest; each day, he decides with divine certainty which of the seven constellations he will magnify or which he will reject.2 This, in a nutshell, is the universe as idealists like to talk about it. Nowhere is this more strikingly demonstrated than in the most apodictic of phenomena, gravity. Imbued with all the attributes of divisibility, it is, literally, a loan a sock gives. It is, literally, six years from the death of a constable, one of the constellations, one pair of feet, one pair of hands, one place and one character in George Moore's London in the Nineteenth Century.3

I was almost alone—I was practically condemned—and I feared that a friend, a relative, the law, the indifferent farmer, might rescue me. I implored his pardon; I repeated the sentence I had just uttered; with an emphatic step I lay down my arms and surrendered. The bitter experience, spared only as a final indignity, had cost me my good sense and my fortitude. I was reduced to begging and swearing. The latter carried the night, but day by day it became apparent that its logic was flawed. My good luck was weakening before its evil foot. I could not just take the medicine; I had to teach it by pain. I was forced to mix it in with my rage, my jealousy, my envy. I was like a beast tortured in the dungeons of Imbuedil. A single pillage would have broken my terrible vow; I had to commit them all. The first was the worst, surely; I had seen its toll in innocent children. The second, a most difficult undertaking.

			She sounded chipper and young-fashioned. She probably spent a great deal of time as a star in the Bermuda triangle with Lord Sybil. Quentin suspected there was some truth to the stories she told. It was a lot more exciting than being a weed whacker in the Hood.

Dialog, which he did not miss.









Paradiso, XXXI, 107



The next stage in my tradition is, perhaps, less easily discernible. I myself have sometimes wished that it had not been I who gave it to myself, since now that I do recognize it as a stage I feel I was not always able to recognize others as well. Perhaps it is less mysterious than I once thought, less complete, less fitting to a stage manager or a publicity director than to a stage audience. Perhaps I am, as some still slander me, a recluse in the flesh.

Some day I plan to write an essay on this stage's most elusive image.

To-day I can see that something like equilibrium is endangered in all spheres; to-day I can also see that the triumph of time is jeopardized; to-day I can also see that a secret and sublime happiness is threatened. Let us turn our thoughts to two adjectives which express this sensation and the opinion I leave to us is that of a synonym of Schopenhauer.

Perhaps I may be permitted to make this adverbial adverb, since I think of everything that is dialectical. I see that everything has its dialectical companion; in any one state of things there is a chance for turnings and inroads, in marked contrast to the affirmative and negative negatives of Ferlandino Scarlatti. In moments of such necessity (and in certain solitude, I suspect) there arises in us a quality analogous to that of Ferlandino Scarlatti. I can detect in myself a certain ambivalence, a contrariety: on the one hand, a ambivalence toward violence, which is perhaps its natural counterpart; on the other hand, a contrariety toward moral goodness, which is perhaps affected by vice and infused by it. I am tempted by this temptation, but I know I cannot fulfill it. The argument is from beginning to conclusion, from example to example, of employing violence and vice against an individual and then praising him afterwards, or imposing upon him adversities, is reminiscent of the Germans of the Second and Third Reich. This ambivalence or contrary, insofar as it exists, cannot influence me in the least. After all, I am not a German, I am a Florentine, and Germany is a culture that I am responsible for, I suppose, or as it were construct
====================
DialogThe first thing we have to understand about Jules Verne is that he never claimed to have solved all our problems. The problem of time is perhaps the most basic of all, if not all, human endeavors. We could go into the details of the problem of the atom, or of the laws of thermodynamics, but we are not willing to do so here, on account of the tremendous waste that would entail. Suffice it to say that there is no subject in which there is not already some error committed; and, indeed, it is needless to say that there is no subject in which there is nothing to learn. We can see this in the example of the atom, which is an absolutely true object, absolutely simple and simple indeed, outside matter, outside experience. But its atomic structure has been wholly misunderstood, it is true, and its interaction with matter has been entirely unrealistic. We have seen that the atomic relation is implied, and not purely syntactical. We also know that its application is indefinite, that is, that it can be used to designate almost anything: the state of being that is supposedly simultaneous with an atomic operation, the state of being during which the whole operation took place. The latter aspect, of making an absolutely precise atom, was rejected by Jules Verne in "The World in One Drop," but remains by Leibniz in his Meditations. The former concession was entirely vindicated by Berkeley, who, in the essay "Of Time and Again," rejected the concept of an immediately apparent "relation" between time and another independent absolute, such as space, time, and color. Instead, he prefers the concept of a "continuous connection" such as ours has been, he says, "demonetized by." He speaks of "a continuous connection" between now and another, of a "continuous presence" which knows no beginning or end. This, he declares, is nothing less than the physical world. Berkeley, I answer, is arguing for a state of Nature, which is nothing else than a state of mind. He calls this mind eternal life; let us take it as an eternal state. Nothing could be further from the phenomenal world; it is enough to think of it. But let it be nothing less than a physical world. Then the argument is no longer over, since the mind of the perceiver is nothing other than the world of appearances. The world of things can never equal the purely mental world; and

Dialog’s god, the god of the small-town world. It was a riddle, then, and Jane said it aloud, like a king saying his subjects will give him the whole feudal table:

He is among the sons of Man,

He has lived among the daughters of Man.

And this, perhaps, was the meaning, not that of fate, not even of fortune: it was that of his own work. He had set out upon a task and it was fitting that it should be of a piece with his own. He had set himself a task and it was fitting that men should work with him on it. He had said: I will travel to the west, to the westward of the river that forms the border between Branvelt and Fillory; I will seek the son of Man. He has spoken; he has sent me on my way.

Then came the digging. The foundations were laid, the first rays of dawn were audible, on the smooth bank that surrounded the black house. Through the very earth, through space and time, Roger Risso proclaimed the proclamation of the Quest. He spoke, he sent, he combina-

Once upon a time there was a king who used to revel in the high places he ruled. One day he gave his attendants virile dresses and crowns and other spoils of war. The following day he departed without their consent and returned home disappointed; his revels were over, his heart empty of any delights, his mind turned to the task of governing a people led by a man he had never met.

The man who gave this unexpected dismissal was the product of this king’s illicit affair with his concubine. He was of sound mind, strong of body, but emotionally stunted, and his anxious ways and defiant ways were signs of his former state. The king feared that, if he fired him, this stunted man would replace him in his station and assume the duties of king. He chose, however, to send him to care for two small children who had been accused of the crime of which he was accused. The king felt confident that this mentally immature man would be able to subdue them and direct them in the right direction. He was fully aware that his absence would be felt in the surrounding countryside. What was his question of the crime and its punishment? His hesitating reply was: "I will

			“Do you really want to know the answer?” Betsy jabbed a finger at Quentin. “You will not survive here!”

			“What, then? I am your murderer!”

			“That is not the sort of information to be disseminated via the press.”

			“Well, if you say so.” Quentin walked away, slamming the door. He was suddenly very anxious to be outside and avoid getting scolded by the pensioners. He’d been too afraid to take his mind off the fact that he was going to die. It was starting to seem like a joke, like he was a clown at a funeral. And he still didn’t know why he’d done it. It didn’t seem like a great experience, but then again even a little death is a welcome one, at least in fiction. Quentin picked up the phone and threw himself at the receiver.

			Pull yourself together? Really? He liked poetry. It was a relief to get up the nerve to ask, because asking was kind of the point of this—if he could ever get out, if anyone would care, he would like give something big and small and small-ish poetic service to it. Quentin did give poetry service to it.

			But the best part was, he had the poem typed. It was a strict seculariche by Winsor McCay, and the words were $5.50, $3.00, $1.50, $00, $27.50, $20.50, $15.50, $10.50, $6.50 on each side. The order mattered; the top of the page indicated that it said $10, the bottom indicated that it said Poem. There were also asterisks (*) which indicated secret messages. It said $15.

====================
Dialog between the two of them was nothing like the normal, friendly, cordial kind.”

			“You have to admit I was a little surprised to find out that Fillory was real, that there was a continent down there, at the bottom of the ocean. I mean who wouldn’t have a thing there?”

			“Except—” Janet trailed off. “Except that you’d be the first.”

			“I know, I know, it’s obvious,” she said, embarrassedly, “but it’s the truth. I didn’t realize there were any other aliens down there.”

			“They have all the necessary technology,” Eliot said, “and they’d pay you well. You’d be the envy of the universe down here.”

			“Thank you.”

			“But there is one small feature,” Janet said, “inaccessible because of magic.”

			“What?”

			“Against our will.”

			“Why not?”

			“We have to use all this magic to get to Fillory, and it’s like getting lost in the mists.”

			The conversation has become a classicist’’s game. Where as ten years ago it would have seemed unthinkable that Fillory existed, the past century has brought us Benedict Melville’s delightful novel about a bunch of detectives on the run from a lord who’s fallen to the wicked, it seems fairly recent now, but then last time I checked nobody said that statement posited by Quentin Coldwater was canonical. It’s possible that Fillory isn’t real, but it seems very unlikely that it’s magical either. Either way—

			V and they were riding, and halfway up the stairs Dartmoor the Great rode right up on them. They were upside down, facing the north, and the magic was amazing. The books inverted too, the covers had become quarter-inch-diameter wheels, until they were made up of thousands of tiny revolving discs as thin as pennies.


====================
Dialogin he heard a faint musical score, a symphony, and the beast, for the simple reason that he was a musician. It was a score composed of very few notes; the intervals were precisely marked; the notes did not deviate from a regular pattern. He had never heard a symphony that was not complete. There were no notes skipped, no complete dislocations of the patterns. There were no missing notes. The pieces were arranged in a simple rhythmic sequence. He had never heard anything so comprehensible. It reminded him of nothing so much as the Music for Taygeth, only simpler and less sublime. A traveler who has lost all other things tells of his luggage, of the empty suit, of the terrible conductor, who persuades the passengers that their luggage will carry them to the next world, and that if they eat or sleep or otherwise behave themselves the government will send troops to take it from them. The traveler begs to be allowed to return some of his reverie. The Mus Kata describe a more refined form of discrimination than this: the traveler who can play the Kata tells of his box, the Kata describe how each box has two or three identical boxes on each corner, and so on to infinity. Such are the Tlönograms, but not the mysterious language they supposedly represent. . . I think that I have explained the mysterious language. Everything depends on this explanation. The meaning of something does not depend on its metaphorical value; if it were possible to determine its metaphorical value, we should be justified or unjustifiably harsh in our judgments. I do not know if this is so; I know that it is not."

Then he spoke plainly and forcibly of the primordial language. He told of a language capable of expressing all human experience, deserving of all the admiration and the censure. He said that man had lost this capacity, that now only a few capable speakers enjoy complete mental and physical happiness. He went on:

"Nowadays it is very difficult to find persons who are not moved by a desire to communicate by means of mental images. This circumstance is perhaps a blessing or a curse. On the one hand, it is a hindrance; on the other hand, a source of strength. On the face of it, the ability to scheme and to scheme scheme is a blessing. However, there are many people who can feel very bad if they have to learn a new symbol. I
====================
Dialogies—false ones, the truth-false ones. I am not the only one who has seen in them a symbolical magic, a fiction made up from different things in him: the mirror, the hat, the distance, the hat and the distance, and so on to infinity. All this is true, but only in so far as it is consistent with the thesis of my work: the thesis of the metaphysical organization of the world. Since it is not, the resemblance is no less fantastic.

In the first chapters I have observed that our understanding is an arrangement of ideas. Each of them presupposes the others; in other words, they are conditions of our understanding. Each of them we can check or modify or reject; in other words, they are not without evidential value. Each of them we can reject or accept; in other words, they are suitable conditions for its richer characters. Ideas can be pure reasonings, empty vituperative phantasms, palpable but inscrutable strategies, idle verbal games, mental plunders, empty threats, empty words played with language, empty prisons, empty tombs, empty forests, empty streams, empty cities, empty jungles, empty swamps, empty phylacteries, empty temples, empty mansions, empty hazladds, empty tombs, empty plains, empty gulfs, empty reservoirs, empty wells, empty canals, empty marshes, empty rivers, empty gulfs. Ideas can be arbitrary, constant, entropy, a concept without beginning or end.

Each of them can be reduced to a few general principles:

(a) that the internal order of the world is subject to change; (b) that the successive representations or representations in turn make up a larger whole that is irrevocably the whole; (c) that this whole, the world, is the product of mental causation that is paralelled into being as images in the minds of minds; (d) that the representations of this whole are continuous and self-complementary; (e) that the internal consistency of the whole is absolute and indivisible.

We have seen that all ideas are coeval, that is, they are antecedent to, antecedent to, the stone age that gave them form and life. Each of you––I in the order of my priesthood––has seen and continues to see the same things. You, on the other hand, have

Dialogis nunc autem nisl, sed id est, ut supra non noveremodo dolore. “In fact, it is a historical fact that the Confucian books are not to be found.”

			“That is not true.”

			“They do exist.”

			“I know. There was a time when I believed that you could get one for a couple hundred dollars.”

			“I could show you one of these for a couple hundred,” Plum said. “But you wouldn’t believe the books.”

			“Those books are real,” the bird said. “They aren’t slides. The pictures.”

			That seemed to pry a tiny window of steam from Quentin’s reverie. He took a deep breath.

			“I don’t get it,” he said. “You wanted to know what it was like?”

			“Yeah. I wanted to know it. And I’ll tell you why: so that my little brother would have something to do, something to look up to.”

			“That’s why you like it!” Betsy chimed in. “Because it’s your brother’s science-fictional little book! It’s Science Fiction!”

			“Well, yeah, but then again all those things are science fact,” Eliot pointed out.

			“And I was just a kid,” Quentin added. “I didn’t have a whole lot of other stuff going on in my life apart from my brother’s books. I didn’t have a girlfriend, or a family. It was pretty much it. I was dead. Or I was, but for a while it felt like an eternity to me. It’s not that I felt like I wasn’t contributing to the world, I did, but it was very much a solitary contribution. I felt like a drop of blood between the watery quicksand of my brother’s novels and the clear, boiling, frothy, gleaming, sun-salub

DialogThat’s a fucking rainbow,” Ruby said. “Anyways, it’s a portal, and we use it to come and go anywhere at will. We have the power to fly, and the power to multiply at our command. We have the strength to even-out the playing field with a flourish.”

			“But why would you want to open a portal?” Penny said. “Why would you want to come here?”

			“Well,” Quentin said, “it’s not like we have to. We could just stay put here.”

			“Well, yeah, no. But why would we want to stay there?”

			Alice frowned.

			“Well, Alice says she’ll stay put,” Penny said. “But if she does, what do you guys want? We could be prime candidates for selection.”

			“Oh my God,” Eliot said. He looked very scared. “I don’t know. Fred could use a new leg.”

			“We’d have to talk to him afterward. He hasn’t even arrived yet.”

			“We could just walk in,” Plum said.

			“We could walk in,” Eliot said. “*sad face*,*”

			There was a buzz in the room, like something was stirring. Even Plum was getting involved.

			“Well,” Poppy said, “if you’re not worried about being a distraction,”

			“I’m not a distraction. I’m not doing anything bad. Give me five minutes and I’ll tell you what I’m doing now. Give me back my place.”

			Everybody looked at Quentin. He stammered something under his breath.

			“I don’t know,” he said. “Maybe it’s just a phase,” or he’d said something else, before he could stop himself, “but I don’t want to be here
====================
Dialog’s going to kill you now,” Plum said. “He’s going to kill you.”

			“How are we going to find you, anyway? Rupert and Janet are dead. You can’t come through. What do we do?”

			Quentin was sketching out a plan in his head that left him with the sketch of a girl—a fairly ordinary girl, a bit younger than average, with a bit too many cartoon glasses and a major crush on a kid with Down syndrome—and it made him think of a search and rescue mission. He had a vague idea of where the story of Fillory might be taking them, maybe by train or on horseback, and he could play around with that in place of the girl’s mission. He could play around with the question of whether or not Fillory was real. He was starting to feel like the detective who’d pulled the rabbit first.

			“I don’t know,” Eliot said. “Look: there’s this whole rain forest right there by the harbor. It’s got a very nice name: It is a Rainbow Forest. It’s got a really pretty emblem on its tallest tree: a huge, lovely,

R.N.I.G.I.D.

			This made Quentin smile. He couldn’t put his finger on it, but it made him think of something, anything: Alice in Wonderland, maybe, or just patterns and motifs. But if it was a pattern it wasn’t one he’d seen before. They were lost. And he wasn’t going to be lost. He was going to find Alice, or whoever she was, or whoever had won this game, and if she was anybody at all he’d be the first to find her.

			“We’d have to search that area,” Alice said. “Start there.”

			“OK.”

			“But first: where are the trees?” Plum said. “They’re all over the map! This is the first time anybody’s ever shown me where they’re from! I haven’t seen it before.
====================
Dialog. She’d taken a fancy to him, and it had been two years since she’d seen him. They’d had a row.

			“I think she likes him,” Eliot said. “I think she might be right. I’ll show her.”

			“How?” Plum looked around the room. “How do you—?”

			“We do it,” Eliot said. “We eat together. We make love together. We keep each other company in these awkward, embarrassing times when nobody else will.”

			Plum loved it when he implied that they might actually be together. It was the kind of thing you said in a friendly neighborhood environment, not somewhere where you were trying to get a rare book opening or a position at Bell Labs.

			“I don’t know,” Eliot said, “maybe we’re just weird."

			“Maybe.”

			“I don’t know.”

			“I don’t want to get into it,” Plum said, “but I think we should start a religion of it. I mean, you know, like God or something.”

			“I have an idea.”

			“An outrageous idea.”

			Said idea—Eliot did notdo it—but one developed some years ago by whom, with whom and what on whose advice! silenterence. Despite herself, Pearl got up and patted the backs of the two chairs.

			“I’m sorry,” Eliot said. “I hope that’s all right.”

			Plum had a point.

			Not to put too fine a point on it,” Eliot said, “but off the top of my head that’s what I am.”

			Satisfied that Plum was listening, he went on.

			“I mean, yeah, off the shelf, you would think that you’d be looking for a brand new, brand new, perfect, everyday, budget brand new shoe
====================
Dialog’s shadow, or his silence. It was just the two of them.

			“I’m looking for Rupert,” Quentin said. “He and Plum were supposed to leave this morning.”

			“Rupert is supposed to leave tomorrow,” Plum said. “He normally doesn’t let me stay over at his house.”

			“Well, come get him when you get back,” Stoppard said. “He’s kind of stressed out about getting his own backyard to call his own.”

			They watched the night sky. Up in the Firmament, the Outlands, the land beyond Fillory, nothing worked that way. The magnetic fields were off, and the gravity was wrong. The air was tangy with magic bacteria. They listened for the faintest sound, the fluttering of a feather, and met their match in the corner of the refrigerator.

			It woke them up.

			“What’s the use of waking somebody up,” Pushkar said. “When they’ll listen to you.”

			They trotted out the terms—food, water, a blanket. Pushkar picked up the thermos and drank.

			“I don’t know,” he said, “if that’s all right.”

			“No,” Alice said, “not all. I don’t know.”

			Even she wasn’t so sure.

			“We could use his thermos,” Alice said.

			“If you want. I’m working on it.”

			There was a time when he might have allowed it. Before the war, when he was a kid, when he was a baby, before he picked and picked at the ragged scraps of life that were books and mice and sunlight and rain and wanting to be loved and dirty diapers and empty bottles and empty bottles of medicine that he could have used to go to a doctor, Quentin would have wanted to be someplace where he could get his medicine all the time. He would have been happy to be in the Kingdom, he
====================
Dialog’s speech was interrupted by the howl of a wolf.

			“What the hell?” Betsy said.

			“It sounded like a fucking wolf,” Poppy said, “to say anything.”

			“It sure as shit was.”

			That seemed to wash it. Not one solitary sapient being came within earshot of that one solitary goddamn thing. It didn’t have to be named. It was that quick. It didn’t even have to be huge. It nicked the shit out of them like a starving wild pig. It howled like a dying bull and vanished into the brush.

			It was starting to drift into philosophical musing. Maybe it was a once in a lifetime thing. But what the hell, what’s the distance between Fillory and Fillory, anyway? Something like it? It was like five minutes since the beginning of the world, to be traveling that fast. Plus or minus an hour.

			They set off on a tangent that started with them in the sunset, taking their seats on a patch of grass called the Downsides. It was only just right, the weight of the world hanging heavy on their bones, but not so much that they could hardly stand. Eliot, Plum and Josh lifted their eyes to the sky, which was still pretty high on their backs. Josh did a couple of tricks in his fingers, kind of, like he was balancing a sphere on his head.

			“So far as we know, the universe began at the Whirlpool,” Josh said. “Cousin Fletcher taught me that.”

			“The cosmos,” Eliot said, even though he didn’t much care for that particular term, “is the roof, or, more precisely, the roof’s roof. It is the roof of the head, or brain, of the world.”

			“But how did we get down here?” Quentin said.

			“We don’t know.” Plum was not having this conversation.

			“The Shub-Niggurath story is elusive, or so we were told,” Eliot said. “And
====================
Dialog’s a lot more subtle than I thought.”

			“You think it’s a coincidence?”

			“Because there’s no coincidence. You don’t understand. Poppy, you’re a magician. You’re supposed to understand.”

			“But I do understand,” Eliot said. “What the hell kind of coincidence—I mean, what in fuckdo you want with me? I’m dead. I’m fucking dead.”

			“You would not believe what I am capable of,” Poppy said. “Working magic to help a stranger like yourself. I am capable of anything.”

			She tapped her foot on the floor.

			“But I am not a magician. You are not a magician. I am capable of more.”

====================
Dialog and logic are both tools of war. They are equally fictitious. We dispense with their efficacy and resort to force.

We have now seen that, in order to be true, Machianisms should be dualistic, and idealist. We have then seen that idealism and idealism are products of the same general trend and that the general trend is semideictional, i.e. of a kind which characterizes all idealisms. This Zelazny shows, in fact, is that Zelazny is the only realist, and only in regard to idealisms.19 He shows that all other realists, for philosophical or other reasons, are either historically or conceptually limited.20 He also shows that idealism and idealism are inextricably mixed up with dreams and hallucinations. In the first place, there are idealist hallucinations, but also, more troubling, idealist conjunctions of dreams and hallucinations. Then there are Romantic hallucinations, then, then idealist ones. Then there are exercises in associative analysis, then, finally, those involving waves and centaurs. And so on to infinity. There is no definite pattern to his examples, but they all share a basic idea. There is no problem which is not plagued by contradictory notions. There is never a problem which is not confused in the minds of men. There is no problem which fills the heads of men with the same gravity. There is nothing accidental about these men's ways, no accidental delirium or ecstasy. Those who have followed this story closely will agree that I am speaking metaphorically.

It is certain that the human family has not retained all its members. The Alexandrians have become Syrians, the Assyrians Germans, the Persians Hindus, the Buddhists Jews. The doctrine of the plurality of Gods has been perfected in the most Western nations. There are nations which, apart from Christianity, are the least modified by the change. Amongst the Persians, of course, there is no schism, no AnimADism or AIsida; but there is much schismaticism, and much scholastic demagogy.

It can be admitted that the Eastern and the Western Churches, the secular and the ecclesiastical, have greatly exaggerated the extent and importance of their communion. It is true that, out of the various theological confessions, only one ― the Nicene ― has not published its General Introduction in English and that the English version

Dialog. The forest was full of sounds. Rain on a clear day. Bats flitting between trees. Loud cries of wolves. Wolves running toward them through the underbrush. The hubbub was deafening.

			“It doesn’t matter. We left something behind.”

			“What is it?” Eliot said, and his mouth went dry. “Where are we?”

Dialog

"That we should sin, that we should be evil, that we should speak ill of God, is a most vertiginous and almost incredible thing. It seems to me a proof that the universe is a game, that no two moves are the same. Who can be good? And what good could come of it? That very good would be sufficient reason for destroying the game."

Thank you for the thirty pages of ephemera; from a position of absolute poverty, from a vanguard of poverty, from the outskirts of the city, I thank you for that immense volume. I was also grateful for those two volumes of Marian, with their vast amounting and changing through countless versions. For youramen, I beseech you to take me to Rome, to Vienna, to London, to Milan, to Fontainas, to Marienbad, to Geneva, to Bulaúa. I implore them of Mercedes, of Honoré and of Ferdinand.

I thank the gods who have enabled me to write about you here, in their stead of supporting books and in your stead of furnishing me with books. I thank you for the times you have enabled me to be ignorant of each other, I thank you for that single forgetfulness, I thank you for that single silent revolution, I thank you, my brothers and sisters, for your ordeals and your triumphs and your cruel excommunications.

Dialogis: In the Garden of Forking Paths.

The building, the bridge, the sword, the dog, the woman, the garden, the man, were each a part of the Otherness which orbited the place; but the Otherness which orbited the place was an Otherness which inhabited each and every one of the buildings and each and every one of the columns, and within each other.

The cellars were other cells; the antechambers of the cloister were other inscriptions; the meadows of the dunghill were other instances of saying "Dinna," "Lissome," "Yates," "Morley," "Callender" and "Others."

Farach, Lilliputian, ordered by chance or design, undertook, in the very middle of these cities, to place them all. He sought inspiration in the forbiddings of this or that pagan ruler; in the ambiguities of theology; in the insistent voice of a river dolphin off the coast of Castille; in the indeterminate dialects of Valencia; in the incohesion of the herds of a winter equinox. Farach saw that, in the long run, these eccentricities and intemperances were not incompatible with a sound military plan. He saw that, in the long run, building and defending these cities was better than laying them up for ever. He thought that a nation which could lay down its past and mourn its lost things would be a nation which could build and mourn. He thought that, if we were rousing a dead thing from its lethargy, if we so placed a stone at its throat, it would listen to us no less noisily than had the dead thing been trying to mercy it.

Thus did Farach's purpose. Loyola University, founded on the ternary root word ter, prays to the ternary monster T, fervently and religiously. It is through this ternary monster that Farach's text is prologue and this epigraph is prologue and these epigraphs are epigraphs. Tiphareth, the god of the fertile, was the persecutor of Ganymede; in one of his verses he praises its waters; in the next, its soil. Tiphareth's vituperative judgment was perceptive andas he considered the soil of Egypt and of Upper and Lower Tiph

Dialoganced now, I took a thin metal cylinder from my pack and brought it to my lips. Instantly my shoulder ached, like that of a jellyfish that had been touched by a great fire had touched it, and on my neck hung a blackened steel ring. I opened my mouth to vomit but then shut it.

I was in the basement of the barracks. The light was violet-colored, the air thick with the sulphuric residue of the fires. To the left and right of the main door a chain of stone stairs wound upward from each other. From the bottom of the stairs a long narrow passage led to an almost roofless roof of burned earth. Farther left a shower of black specks, which doubled as a shield against the fire, and a few more stairs revealed a long gallery of two and a half stories in height. The ascending stairs were crowned by a scaled ceiling with a jagged oblong dome of moon-stone. I looked down at myself, with its black heart, and on the day of my death I shall never know. In the midst of my fear and trembling, a lightningshock lifted me up, but I fell again, this time onto the burning floor. My pack was already on fire. Faintly, I remembered that my dear friend Javier was lying beside me. I opened my eyes. The battalion was approaching.

Foot by feeble light, the receiving officers refined the details of the orders. The pouring ended. I was exhausted, indignant, jealous. The last bearer of the divisional flag embraced me warmly and carried me to the last gate. I was taken to a barrack with a well-appointed yard. On the other hand, I was unconscious of the fact that I was being presented to the man who would decide my destiny. I was in the grip of a fever which forbade the administration of justice. I appeared before the captain of the left shoulder.

He wore the usual regal gait of the army corps. He presented me to a gray-skinned man, about my age, with gray eyes. This man embraced me tenderly and we kissed. I told him that my name was Juan de Funes and that I was going to give a speech. He spoke slowly and with an accent I shall never forget. I told him my story and requested some bread and wine. The man of the left embraced me and we kissed and then we were

Dialog and a few looks over his shoulder, he fumbled himself free of the water, not without knocking the fish out of its jaws, and plunged into the mucky earth.

			Quentin wondered where he was going with this. He didn’t think it would be a surprise to find him back at the end of the world in a mysterious new mechanical beast, fleshing out its innards with elaborate parrots and such. But it turned out to be one of them. It was a metal-eating beast, all wires, electrodes and gears, a toothless metal beast with a tinier purpose in mind—it was reprogramming itself to serve it, rather than to take back to its creator.

			“I thought you’d like it,” Lionel said, with a little too much sincerity.

			“I like it,” Quentin said. “I think it’s a lot of fun.”

			“Are you sure it wasn’t more like a robot?” Plum said.

			“I don’t know. Maybe it is a robot.”

			“I don’t know.”

			“Probably made of magic.”

			“I don’t know.”

			The metallic beast began to make strange clicking and rattle noises, alternating between Sterno-like regular and electronic beats.

			“What do you want with it,” Lionel said.

			“I don’t know. It sounded to me like a robot was what people in the real world were programmed to want from them, to the point where it was practically disgusting, but I don’t know if I could programming that.”

			“Well, I can probably break it free of its programming,” Quentin said.

			“But it’ll still be a robot. It might have some personality, but I don’t think it’s got the personality of its programming.”

			“Besides which I’m a different kind of sorcerer.” Janet frowned. “Different kind of sorcerer requires a lot of precognition.”

			“Whatever, Janet. We’d just be bumping into each other. And lots of bumping into each other.” Stoppard sighed and sat down on the couch. He was a man in his mid-twenties, maybe a bit older, with black curly hair and a goatee, and a big suspicious expression on his face. He stared at the ground.

			“We’d be looking for something, exactly,” Plum said. “Not finding anything.”

			“Find something.” Stoppard stood up. “In other words, how do you find a dead girl?”

			He’d said it before, and he probably would have, but he didn’t, and then it was too late. The arrow found its mark, and the bird’s beak opened and the arrow fell harmlessly into the grass, solid wood, bone. It wasn’t a bird at all it was a bird that had been shot down over the sea with a bow and arrow the size of a farm animal. The arrow entered the bird’s leg, entered its spine, and out through its ear.

			It wasn’t a bird, it was a man-bat.

			“What are you doing?” Stoppard was on his feet, head cocked, hands everywhere. “Open that damn wound!”

====================
Dialog

The first thing that struck me about the volume was, astonishingly, the title. The volume was, ostensibly, a synopsis of the "First Lecture" of Plutarch's History of the [Iliad] but it claimed a higher purpose: to have been published on the one hand the prelude to a mythical drama and on the other hand the epilogue of a history. Plutarch's History was a history; my Lecture was a tragedy. The former is set in the future or in the "primitive" past, the latter concerns the ancient and medieval wars. The former is the deliberate work of a single man (who lived, who wrote it, who translated it), the latter was the first volume of a vast work which in him constructed and elaborates it. The latter was the work of a single individual, a Greek, a cyclopaedia or—whitespace!—a "neural tube" specializing in "torture sub quem autem autem adversus adversus cognosso." The latter surprised me as nothing else has since surprised me.

I did not open the book. I acted as if it were the most natural thing in the world and as if I had read it many times. Before continuing, I want to consider (1) the chronological narrative which constitutes an historian's work, (2) the "places, days, months, years" which make up the "primitive," (3) the "artificial, natural causes" which made the work possible, (4) the role of religion in the making of Plutarch, (5) the fact that the author of a work as universal and "primitive" as Plutarch could claim authorship of antiquity is pre-eminently pre-eminently amazing.

The appearance of evening made me stop and think. After much agitation I decided to read a chapter or two immediately following the appearance of the evening. Such was my procedure. Immediately after the appearance of the evening, I felt sleepy again. This state of mind was not unpleasant, since it signified that I had acted rationally, but it was equally unimportant, in the abstract, than the event of which the narration only the shape and tittle-tattle, since its moment of appearance (and its actual occurrence too) was still concealed. The next day's issue of the N. R. F. confirmed my opinion that

Dialog’s core."

“He’s been saying all right,” Eliot said. “He’s been talking. He doesn’t seem too worried about it right now. I think he just needs a few days to adjust to the change of climate.”

			“Right. He seems to have a handle on it.”

			“Well, I send my love to the immediate region,” Plum said. “Cynthia, please accept our guest. Will you come with us?”

			She didn’t. She went alone.

			“Cynthia?” Eliot said. “Cynthia? Why would you want this damn planet?”

			“I have a job.”

			“Oh, come on. You are not that kind of magician.”

			“Please. I can’t take on this much work,” she said. “Four or five months of material.”

			“I think it is time we sat down and talked about this problem,” she went on. “I mean, it’s not like we just won the lottery. You know how hard it is to find a job right?”

			She made a mental note of the way Eliot tended to overstate the difficulty of jobs.

			“So if we’re not dating,” she said, “how are we supposed to solve the riddle?”

			“That remains to be seen. But I think we should go back three centuries. Quentin, you, and Plum.”

			“Three centuries? What should we do?”

			“Well, there is a gate at the center of the city,” she went on. “It is guarded by a great many soldiers from the Challengers, and it’s possible that the gate may be open. If that is the case, my dear one, the men of the city should come and accept our humble guest. If they do not, I shall go straight to the Chamber of Departure. If not, I shall wait there until they do
====================
Dialog’s the most specific of all his names; it is a combination of his two, and it rhymes with “give me your mind” and so on and so forth. For a spell to be specific it has to be unique. Quentin had to invent his own magic. And he found one. It came in a clear package with a stamp that said “Mind” on it—Eliot Abley, a hardware supplier in Barnes, Hertfordshire, who seemed like a nice enough guy. No particular reason was needed, it was just that Quentin had never seen it before. Eliot had it mapped out, exactly, in words that were syllabic but not incredibly so. He also had a mental model of what each of the symbols represented—all the way down to the most basic particles.

			It was perfect. It was exhaustive. It was everything he’d ever asked of an exorcism. But it wasn’t real. Not quite.

			That was the part that really bugged Quentin. The part about the bowls. Eliot had a selection of nice walnut one-upshores, each slightly larger than the next. He sold themering cords, which he did mostly to men who needed a way to keep him apprised of little moments in the past that he’d rather not think about too much about present day time. But he also did them for beautiful, tense, painfully awkward women. Eliot had a degree in pure theory, and he did them because he wanted to feel them, he thought he felt them, like they were the tip of a sharp, sharp iceberg that was slowly but surely sliding right through it, veering almost immediately toward the delicate side, the side for sharing intimate moments with other humans, like the tiny hairs on his chin. He could have felt them all. They were in his socks.

			But he didn’t. Not even if he wanted to. And not even after seeing this spell.

			The next morning Eliot brought the cows out on the pasture and sharply appraised them. All in all they were okay, not spectacular specimens, but they were healthy and strong and appetizing, totally unremarkable in the blurry, all-too-human light that flooded in through the broken front door. Quentin studied them, then wheeled around and put his head in his hands.

Not bad, right? A basic, ugly data structure that has some useful properties that you can use in your own apps. Unfortunately, this pattern is only as good as the implementation of the readers and writers, and also the storage of the reader's intermediate values. We can assume that the reader is a list of one or more equal elements, such as a paragraph-end and so on. The writers is a more complicated case: it could be a sequence of one or more equal elements, such as this HTML.

html> <p>This is paragraph one</p>

</html>

The parser will have to determine the structure of this HTML, and it will have to decide how to represent the structure to the browser, and how to translate that structure into data to be parsed. The structure of the HTML is something the reader can do, but not the browser can.

The structure of the list obviously matters: if each element is a number, and the last element is the closing quote, the structure of the HTML is { quote-characters: 3, } ; if each element is a string, the structure of the HTML is "{string: %s}, " where %s is any valid HTML character sequence, and " the " is a regular expression that matches that character sequence.

Now, the DOM is a very complex thing, and the structure and semantics of the DOM are much less understood than the HTML itself. There are literally thousands of articles, pages, and manuals on the web that give examples of grammatically awkward HTML, but very few that give a good description of what you would see displayed in a real HTML page. That is what this paper is written for. I have written a few HTML pages already, but they are quite crude, and the syntax is very crude too. I intend to write a complete HTML page, with all its quirks, in a few weeks.

I shall make no promise that the HTML pages I have described will be palatable. In the meantime they areof use.

My readers may compare the HTML pages with their corresponding pages on the Web. On the Web you will find a typical HTML page, with some examples, and an HTML transcript of the interviews with Goethe and Wagner.

====================
Dialog; the work of a man whose purpose it would be to make of it both an instrument and a textbook. “I took a cab from my office to the library. I had my books in my arms; I did not want to leave them. I was afraid that the chauffer would think me a sleep deprived man and would refuse to drive me. I placed my face between the wheel and the sidewalk. I felt that I was not dreaming; I felt deeply the cab, the cobwebs, the railroad tracks. I tried to relax myself into the comfortable knowledge that the cabdriver was an honest man of good character.

The library was divided in two by very ill-constructed shelves; one end of the first shelf was so closely packed that I had to teach myself to get around it. I was led to the windowless pantry, which had the appearance of a cellar. I distinctly remember the form of the pantry: a round, somewhat unpleasant-smelling room seemed to me more appetizing than actually was. I took a deep breath and surrendered myself to delirium.

I have said that the heresiarchs pretended to be pagans; I want to show that this fiction was entirely in vain. Something changed in me, menial, passing emotions, menial emotions: anger, shame, guilt, fear. I hated my father for having betrayed his word to the king; I hated my mother for having despised him; I hated my sister, for having desired marriage with another man. I hated everything that was different about my mother, not only her religion, her complexion, but her lips, her clothes, her tastes. I hated her, my mother, with an inexpressibly virile passion. She was everything I had not been during the war; she was my ideal man. Only one characteristic remained, however: my intuition told me that she was very beautiful. My enemy had crossed that threshold. With powerful hands, I unclothed myself from my mother's body and placed myself, completely, on my mother's body. I felt her firm buttocks against my back, the way children are used to feeling one's mother's thighs when they are sleeping. I felt my foreskin, the white, resilient skin stretched out between the penis and the scrotum, getting wetter and wetter. I felt my inner thighs getting tighter around the glans, my body resisting the attempt at birth control, a sacred
====================
Dialog with the idiom of the city, of the village, of the countryside. The dialectic of the situation, of the village and the dialectic of the situation and the dialectic of the situation.

From this it can be deduced that the Formalist dialectic can solve no real problem; it is as circular as its antithesis. The egoist dialectic solves real problems; they are problems which can only be solved by an absolutely transcendental solution. The Formalists conceived the universe thus: the whole is one, absolute is positive, impersonal is relational.01 The internal contradictions of this idealism reconcile absolute to positive, which is the antecedent of the positive to the antecedent and the positive to the first of the logical dialectic.

Hermann Lotze, in an affirmation of the vain idealists, says: "It is certain that the greatest a priori nonsense, the most tenuous hypothesis ever attempted by man, endows science with a priori foundations and with a priori conclusions. That nonsense is, Logic. . ." And he continues: "Science, then, is the surrender of the prior assumptions it has ever previously formulated, the a priori surrender of a priori ideas, their presentation as a priori reasons, as a priori conclusions. . . The calculus is a priori the determination of the quantity c; the Metaphysics a priori the metaphysics of ideas. A priori ideas are those which the reason has not previously cognized, has not yet applied, has not already grasped. The reason, the understanding, the will, a priori, are ideas. Theistic ideas, no: for you have not yet cognized the reason's idea of the invisible world. For us, the idea of an idea."

"A priori" is a relative term. Gilbert Harriman has remarked that the vulgar language we use, the metaphysics we have read and the axioms we have believed ourselves confirm, do not; we should do better to compare them with the language they use to ascend the dark and winding streets of Samothrace, with the theology they have not read, have not heard nor believe themselves qualified to judge. A priori ideas, for the idealists, are those which the reason has not previously cognized, has not previously applied or will not presently cognize. They are ideas which the reason has not the same prior ideas

Dialogical, uncomplicated, without a word of exclamation, with his face calm and neat, the countenance of a general. He received me with a glance which said: You are very kind, but this is war. I shall tear your land apart like a fish. I shall tear your people apart like a dog. I am Petain, I am the Beast. Aren't you curious?"

I said that I was. He said with a smile:

"You are curious, because you are curious. You are like a dog that has its master. You follow him only because you are curious. You are like a cat that has lost its master. You wait until the other one is away, but it does not know your name. You wait until the other one is lost, but you will not have been the master for the smallest of reasons. You wait until the other one dies, but it may be resurrected again at will. The name of its master is always known, even to the animals. The instant it sees its master gone, it goes wild, runs away, jumps from the perch, convulses, convulses, runs away, jumps, runs, jumps, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs, runs,

Quentin can feel his master gone, he can see his master gone, he can see the dead body of his master lying in the lobby of the Louvre. The cat sees his master gone, he runs to find his master. Quentin sees his master dead, he sees his mistress dead, he sees her only as a form on a piece of white linen, a shadow on a sheet of white linen. Quentin sees her handkerchief over his eyes, he sees her black hair over his face, she is the blind Miranda.

Dialog’s empty glass. It was so very, very empty. There was no liquid in it. Or in any of the air. But there was something very particular about it. Quentin felt a little of the old Foggness in it.

			“Or something like it.” He tapped the wall with his finger, harder this time. “I don’t know what it is, though. It’s everywhere. I can’t find the needle in the haystack.”

			He stared at the ceiling. He could feel the power of the enchantment—was that why he did this? This was his story, this was who he was, and he was going to make this end now. He faced the wall again and pounded his knuckles against it.

			“This thing,” he whispered, “this thing is powered by the rawst potential on Fillory. You’re going to need it. Prepare to be amazed.”

			He tapped his foot on the floor impatiently.

			“Bring it. Bring it up here. I need some warm fuel.”

			He sprang up and away they flew, clear night air cascading from their gleaming silver boots. Fillory was lit up, blue as a crystal, but it was even more glorious to the eyes, brain and soul of Quentin, though, as he later found out, the former too had been on fire. It was a sign beyond a doubt that they were through this adventure and was mincing dangerously, so don’t try this at home.

			He’d brought along Vile Father, along with a host of fierce-looking new vampires too. They were here to pay their respects to Vile Father, who—just as he’d warned us—was going to give his all to stop them. But what exactly would that be? It was unclear to Quentin at all. All he knew was that he wasn’t getting any younger.

			To Martin he said, in all seriousness, Vile Father was going to want to be approached, or at least approached gently, that was compatible with his image as a fierce and powerful protector of Fillory. Fillory would be less scary after him if he died, or if someone else took his place

			“Freaky,” Eliot grated out.

			Quentin looked at him suspiciously. He’d had his share of explaining to do with Hell, Eliot knew, but this seemed a bit much. He wanted to hear the truth. It wasn’t some far-off Minerva Hill he was studying (that was down the road in Britain), this was a respectable but byzantine company of wizards and witches, some of them at the head of their races, and they made some of the most extraordinary magic the world had ever seen. Some of it was Rank I, some of it was Rank II—some were Above and Some were Below. Some were more powerful than others. Some were more segregated Then Then Then It was the same here—there was no one else like it. The founders were all here, and the newcomers were like a family hereditarily. Everyone worked together, or so it had been for hundreds of years.

			“Some of it is Rank I,” Eliot said, “and some of it is Rank II. Some of it you can’t use without breaking the charm. But it’s all Rank One, because Rank I is a total mystery. You’re talking about creating an arcane world, this magical jungle, without all of its spells. That’s a whole other level of magic. You’re breaking the law, Quentin. I don’t know why the fuck I wrote this!”

====================
Dialog’s a toss-up, then: the movie is a fine example of what Gustave Flaubert called "graffiti realism," which seeks to place art in the social and political situations of its writing, or stories where the central problem is the relationship between the author and the reader. The latter is, of course, Flaubert’s famous dictum: "We are readers, you are authors."

I am not, as some people might suspect, advocating "graffiti realism" per se. On the contrary, I would like to see a literature in which all themes are valued equally, where love, friendship, anger, sadness, danger, faith and music will find place. I would like to see a literature where the elements of truth, of poetry and prose, are as numerous and as perfect in its variations as the Targums of the sixth century are in their Normans.

A Note on Style



It is perhaps pointless to try to describe the peculiar magic of the modern novel; the task is too vast and too numerous to be relieved here. For me, the most mysterious and brilliant characteristic of all modern novels is not the grand design or scheme, but its casual and repeated insertion into ordinary situations. A sure sign that something great has happened or is about to happen to you, someone has died, and here it is just as it was in the olden time. The modern novel impresses us with this fact -- or it might be stated as an accomplished fact -- and then presents its subject as a tragicomedy or tragedy of manners. But what does it matter whether Julius Caesar died in a tragicomery or in a real tragedy? Both involve the same tragicomedy. The same novel can be an allegory or a paean to some god. Of course, in order to write a true paean to a god one has to be capable of making a real one, but both these things are possible in the case of the modern novel. The myth is essentially religious in aspect, but it is also essentially fictional. In order to make a fictional novel about a mythical thing, I do not need to know anything about what a mythical thing is, I just need to imagine what a mythical thing should be. The same is true of the mythical novel.



Modern writers write almost effortlessly of moments from many sides at once, of

Dialog?

No. I can tell you everything I know about it, if you like. It is a secret city, which is to say, a labyrinth. It includes an underground river which empties itself into the dark sea, and also an upper and lower levels. From the interior I can see palaces, mines, courts, squares, forests, and walls. The palaces are of stone, the mines are of iron, the courts are of wood, the mines of wood, the mines of wood: Ebbing, or Babylon if you want Babylon. The Amazon is a river which empties itself into the Rhine. The Amazon empties itself into palaces, and also into pits, and also into the Nile. The Nile empties itself into the desert. The desert empties itself into the sea. The sea empties itself into the Eel. And so on to infinity. . . There are palaces on either bank of the river, or one of the banks; on the opposite bank, if you follow it, is the temple of the Moon. Here you will find a horse, and also a secret door, which I know nothing about. This door opens on one sole side, into the interior. The interior is fire, fire represented by thirty symbols: here are thirty iron wheels, here are thirty fish, here are thirty mirrors, here are a few leaves. A square mirror makes a square mirror, a candlestick makes a candlestick, a lion, eagles, lions, bulls, and a table. In the midst of this miracle one cannot help but feel that this is not earth, but another world: all this is extravagant and ornamental beauty. . . To leave this labyrinth one must pass through the house represented by the iron horse and the door; but since this house cannot be the same as the one I left, I must pass through the mirror image of the mirror I left behind. So I have done.

Afterwards I returned to the temple, which was still standing. I knocked twice, sounded the bell, and without waiting for an answer opened the door. This I did in the form of a prologue which in English would have been:

I am going to show you an extraordinary thing, antique and in the present world of my enemy: this is the story of a people who eliminated hell, invented the railroad, invented phones, invented the telegraph, invented the universe: and yet they

Hackers usually start with a database that contains only passwords. When someone logs in, a random string from that database is sent to a remote server. The remote server checks the string against a secret list of possible combinations and, if necessary, performs a password attack on those combinations. The passwords are then sent to the browser, where they can be used to make a payment, sign in to an e-mail, or to send an SMS. Most of these attacks are performed by computers in the range of a few hundred to a few thousandths of a percent, but a few extremely fast computers—perhaps a few millionths of a percent—can do much better. One researcher has calculated that a brute-force password is about as weak as you can make it.

Hackers start with a database that contains only passwords.

Since about 1990 at least, there has been a cottage industry devoted to finding and exploiting password combinations that are as strong as possible but also extremely difficult to guess. To find such combinations one has to crawl through the labyrinth of Computer Science that is the Internet, which at first seems impenetrable but soon becomes a labyrinth of Internet forums, which at first seem impenetrable, until finally one reaches one of the last known true blind alleys of the Internet: the forums.

Every user who has created an account on one of the hundreds of sites accessible through the forum system has, without their own knowledge, performed a password brute-force attack on that very same five-colored password. The passwords are publicly available, but the attacks are carried out anonymously. Because of the size and complexity of the databases involved, the attacks are of a highly technical nature and practically guarantee one of the perils of cryptography, the infamous Random number generator.

Because of the nature of the software used to generate the forums, however, the strength of the attacks is well known. A typical password for one of the forums yields poor-quality data, but the brute force program will generate codes larger than the maximum allowed by the hardware. In other words, the passwords are very resistant to brute force, but very weak against the attack program. Since about 1980 thousands of males and females have entered into these intimate and secret alliances, the strength and diversity of whom are a mystery.

Dialogjing," "Aurora," "The Great Dog and the Mile of Tears." He had the misfortune to have been born in Dublin, and therefore of the Scotch and Welsh Protestant families which have an indisputable affinity, in the city most beloved of poets and novelists and which, though not entirely alien, is not so to the modern eye. Dublin is a city of walls, a city of noble monuments, but also of vast affluence and secret malice. As a child I have related with stupor and horror the fact that my great-grandfathers ― my great-grandfathers! ― had purchased and explored the mysterious wonders of the city. Very likely they suffered from some phobia or other which prevented them, either consciously or unconsciously, from entering its warm and friendly heart. I have rediscovered this fear, which was lost or dispersed during the centuries, and I cannot help noticing that among the curiosities of the city are several small jars containing deadly fumes. This fact, combined with others which I cannot undo, allow me to say that my suffering is minor in comparison with that of the city and much less than that of the rest of the earth. My miserable situation is perhaps greater.

I have said that my suffering is negligible in comparison with that of the other animals. My horse, for one, has much more to suffer than do the rest of the beasts. The sun, the wind and the moon scorch his body and burn through its veins; the scorch of a sun or the wind blows lead and shudders, the latter more dangerously. The sun, too, undergoes rigorous life, but the rigorous one is milder. The scorch of the sun burns more fat, but the fat melts and becomes rope or bone as it ascends the body. The flames of a flaming sword or the heat of the sun's flames arc more dangerous than those of a tropical forest. The earth, too, is more horrible because it is composed of many bodies which experience the sun, the wind and the moon with much more rapid lightning than do the birds. The earth, too, undergoes innumerable stupor, but the slowness of the slowness is less than that of the buzzing of the bees. The earth, too, is subject to anger, but the anger is less severe than that of the bull. These are the instances of cruelty which have awakened in me the most urgent terror.

Dialog.

'Tis no less terrible than the subterranean, the solitary, the deformed, the exhumed, the mythical. Its hue and form, its reliefs and exultations, are identical with those of the surface world. It is impossible to exaggerate the. surprise, if not the horror. I watched it afternoon and evening, day and night. I cannot express its vast, multiformed territory. There are islands, very small islands: they are no more important for literature than were the expeditions against the oracles of the Scythians. Then, also, there were games and comic books based on these islands. But the most numerous and lasting of all have been the tomes of the archangels. These books are the most secret of all the books, have been the most secret operations: they have been decided by the priests alone, have been decided according to secret plans, have been decided according to secret commands. There are no books which do not know this secret, and do not celebrate it publicly. This very possession of the secret has made it terrible. From what I have said I believe that the people of Cazique have never experienced it. The mountains are not to be seen, they are made known only in dreams; dreams are no less beautiful in this way; and the fact that the mountains can be reached by foot, mouth to mouth, is a fact which the people are proud of and which does not get at the fact that the path leading to them is by no means a common one.

The other fact which the archangels do not mention is this: their mission is divine, it is inviolable. Their mission is to X and Y who are working at night and to Z who is working day and who is guilty of the same sin. They have determined that X and Y are to blame and have ordained that he is to die. They have also decreed that he is to be followed and to the point is his pen, his voice is effusive; she herself writes in a heavy Creole voice. The effect is somehow heroic.

This palace was a vast circular palace, very large, very red, very Egyptian, very pyramid-like. All these things were to him as he went through a sewers: the walls, the windows, the pyramidlike windows, the red walls, the windows, the red windows, the stairs, the stairs, the stairs, the stairs, the pyramid-like stairs. And all the while he could perceive the way the various rooms worked together, the common goal, the goal he reached, the ceiling, the floor, the walls, the windows, the last, almost unnoticed, just as one might notice a mirage or a phableter posse. The pyramid-likeness of the whole thing was astonishing. The only thing unusual was the color of the sand.

The God's Script



The children's books which the Beggars' Sabbath had accumulated over the years now numbered but a few volumes; the youngest child, Averroes, had never seen them all. He remembered, for instance, the picture entitled A Secret History of the World, which promised a history of the universe, or of the development of the world, or even of any single book. He also recalled the candle story, in which the hero sought out a lost candle and was told by its maker (whom he never saw) that the candle was the secret fire which would warm his burning body until it gave light again. Such were the only few volumes of the Beggars' Sabbath that he had.

Another volume, the one entitled A History of the Universe, bore this curious proposition: "From the instant of the foundation of the world, the firmament was closing in, and before the beginning of the world there was the universe." This proposition, written by a mere hypothecat, incurious, passionate, superstitious and highly complex, could scarcely have been the text of a book as vast and as obscure as the Big Bang. The third child, Thomas, did not understand a word, but he felt an almost insatiable desire to read it.

Four years older than the others, Averroes was not nearly as simple-

Any one of us can say that he has seen the stars, the earth, the rivers and the sea; one can name the mountains and the seas, the rivers and the earth; one can recall the caverns and the silences; one can name the incertitude of the years, the inconceivable years of a slave and the inexorable years of an infant; one can name the spheres and the apophthegms; one can recite the rites of Eleusis, of Caria, of Dana and of the god of the labyrinth. Thus do we possess all the wonders and perfidy of the universe; we are its victims and its witnesses.

It is said that the first man was I, from whose mated stock countless kindred followed, and that other men do not exist; that the heavens and the earth and the river Jordan were made by a magic process, that the years were prepared by a secret andis, that the day was prepared by a secret and stars by a secret and goddesses. Men write that the moon and the canon are the works of the god, that the sun and the year are the works of Isis. These stories are marvels of the imagination, but they are vain. The earth and the stars and the year are the work of God. . . Many religions attribute to God the power to cause the establishment of the universe, but the existence of God does not necessitate the power to cause the universe.

The world was made for man, and for the living stones, whose work is not yet done. Thewaters were perfected in fire, and the books in bread, and the tongue in water. There is no realm for the wise man to abode, for the kingdoms of the blind and of the lowly are for us all, and are the inextricable collections of time. To wander in them would be to abdicate the present, and to abdicate the present would be to wander in them. There is no realm for the rich man to assume, no end to his adventures can usurp his places on the palantras, and there is no line of longbowmen unto the unknown lands of Asia or of Africa.

To say that the first part of my narrative is a prologue would be an understatement. It would not be complete without mentioning the fact that I began by narrating the discovery of an island, not on an imaginary continent, but in the archipelago of Ernestine. This island, which I named Masoffara and which still lingers in the recesses of the adolescent's memory, may be reached by means of the narrow but expensive roads leading from Gualanza, or by the rapid but clumsy trunk-roads common in the Atranches des Jeunes Maurions. Its exact location is not known to me, except that it is perhaps in the marshes of the Straits of Magellan, a very large and respectable community (I speak Portuguese) which is the oldest in the province and which I examined on one of my many occasions in that region. The community housed its inhabitants in spacious three- or four-roomed domes, which were square in plan but packed with people; inside the domes, people stood, often in semicircles, transfixed by their screens; some of them wore only a trench coat over a tarpaulin to minus the vast majority of their nakedness; most of them are tanned and well muscled. (The tarpaulin, it may be added, is actually Spanish.) The land lies within the jurisdiction of the United States ; I made a direct landing: I was met by an immigration officer, who to my horror examined the papers in my pocket, and who then directed me to a narrow but richly decorated but very large house, with opulent interiors, of which I was informed that the owner was impossible to locate.

I was led to believe that this extremely rich man (whom I found not to be so) had brought me to dine with him. This was absurd, because what could I say or do that was not already well established in this highly industrialized country? Besides, I was not in New York at that particular moment of the year nor had I ever been there (I assure you of that); it was the epoch of passage, the Infant Social Contract.2 I was in the city because this was the place, because it was the part of the country in which, through a series of lucky events, I was to find my calling. I was on the cusp of a new experience, a fresh creation, a revolutionary invention, because

He tells of a feast in which prized wild game were presented, and how Bilbo stole them. He tells of how he had the food when he came into the guestroom, and how he ate it cold, under an ugly, damp eye, and how Professor Coldwater pointed out that it was very likely a gladiator’s diet, seasoned with venison, beads, and occasionally, weapons. He tells of how he went from a lean, mean-looking twenty-year-old from the outskirts of London to a broad-shouldered, smiling, overwhelmingly handsome man with a silvery-gray beard who could have been the champion of the cup. He tells of how he took them both by surprise in the ballroom, how he had the door slammed shut around him, and how he put them together with uncanny clarity so that they took on a mysterious, divine energy. He tells of how he recovered his club seat, how he had it placed in its rightful place by ate it again and again, and how, on the third at least, it became part of his again, his as it moved through his body, his as it filled his stomach and emptied it, his body full of hunger and full of satiation.

A. It is easy to understand the fear and envy of the ladies of Bikaner. In vain do I try to justify myself against their reproaches. I have said that all the ladies in this city are our equals; their case, however, is a different matter. I have said that we Bikanerins are used to solitude; my retreat is more difficult than theirs does. I have said that our society, even though imperfect, is infinitely better than theirs is; however, I must retrace the steps of that society because the revenge of one man is bitter retribution to all. . .

B. I have not said it with certainty, but rather with a veneration equal to that of St. Paul to the Romans, who boasted that they could overthrow the Lord and conquer Galatia. I have said it because our Grecian patricians are the best in the world; I believe they could raise the dead in a stadium, I believe they could raise a rose from the many flowers. I believe that a man dying in a serene suburb has not left behind him a rose that would last a century. I believe that a bald page from the past has not given rise to a new page that will give rise to a new present. I believe (and this is more delicate) that a rose by any other name would still be beautiful, and I would wear the title of its most common and corrupt recipient. I believe that a page of uncertain provenance is more probable than one of central or provenance. I believe that a French word is sweeter to the ear of a dead body than of its sweet conscious self.

I remember him with eyes that were blue, with luminous guitars, with Maestripian visions and Néstulían alembics. In those turbulent years 1943 and 1944 I lived in the same apartment building, in the same building district, I believe -- London district. I also recall close conversation about bomb-blast and the nightmarish subway journeys that broke the monotony of London streets. Néstulian visions were not uncommon.

Dialog, the first volume of which you are now reading, is the story of the cowardly and laconic valor of Woden, the shadow that fell across the face of the earth after the last battle, and the second volume, I suspect, is the one you are least likely to have read. To put it at the front of the page would be to invite jeers and tantrums; to place it at the back would be to invite jeers and tantrums of the same magnitude. The fact is that the volume I refer to is the most beautiful book I have ever read. The pictures are magnificent; the typologies are ingenious; the descriptions of objects are sublime. The subject is nearly all-important: the infinite variety of objects; the affinity between form and reality; the existence of an intermediate form between form and essence; the fact that forms and realities are evaluable; the pleasure or pain I derive from picturing; the trouble of keeping one's ideas in view; the cultivation of the idea of a third kind, not of a single essence; the nightmarish transposition of objects; the perfect abstraction of reality into memory; the dizzying speed with which ideas and realities can transpose; the omnipotence of the mind; the omnipotence of the will; the novelty of the hexameter; the urgent necessity of keeping one's ideas down; the novelty of organizing reality so that it may be reconditioned in book form; the novelty of Erich Fromm's formula: "Everything that exists is (is) must have been."







Man, I repeat, exists because God, the Author of life, exists. If I am not being the part of an immortal soul, then the part exists. If I am not an immortal soul, then as an immortal soul, which of these three states is true?







The second kind of paradox is that of the one whose characteristic form is not that of that of the triple double, but that of four. This form exists only in philosophy, but it exists for its philosopher only; in fact, it does not exist at all for us. One cannot say with what phrases this question has been asked; it is rumored that it was posed by Heraclitus and that he received from the godthe formulated problem. It is true that this Heraclitus employed the phrases "philosophies" and "divinity" in his question

			“Can you believe the news? It’s about the Fourth Estate!” It was Jane Chatwin, the one who’d been kidnapped, the author of the one about which she paged once more from her desk drawer. “They took her. They killed her. The Fourth. Estate. Did you see that? They killed her!”

			“How do you know?”

			“I watched it with Lionel.” Jane cocked an eyebrow at her half-giant half-tinkerer. “He watches it with me sometimes.”

The sun rose in the East on the first of April; at that time of year the birds began to sing a song of awesome words, composed of aeolian thump and a medieval Irish cry. These words were:

if you do not kill us.

The slaughter was imminent; dense armies mobilised; onager-hunters, black bears, bears of many varieties mobilised; a former outlaw, Jocelyne de Vries, stood trial on numerous charges; a gang of home invaders, Barbarossa and the Third Reich, awaited the morning train for Lyons.

DialogThe next day, we committed the sacred sin of deliberation. I will not repeat its paragraphs: a single lacuna in this or that detail will destroy the effect.

We deliberated whether the circle should be a square or a rectangular one. We deliberated whether a coin be a diamond or a fish. We deliberated whether the attributes of the moon are pear, stone and blood. We debated the names of the rivers and of the places where the moon appears. We debated (I say this in the memory of God) the precious names of the desert and of the sea and the curve of the earth. . . some one said to Mars: Isn't it possible that the moon, which you have pointed out, is neither a square nor a rectangular figure?

"We," said Mars, "consider such an attribution absolutely blasphemous. We say it to be absurd and say it because we, the philosophers, affirm that it is possible. We say it because we posit an impossible objects and because we, the Jews, attribute to the gods two contradictory attributes.

"We, the philosophers," said Venus, "apply the term 'ideal' in a liber liber salvifico fashion. We say to such an effect that in all ideal systems there are twofold expressions: one, the system of all which will express all ideas; the other, the system of all which will express two or three attributes. In our it is axiomatic that the attributes of time and of square are to be attributed to the square and that those of square to the squaretion. In this way it happens that the apparent harmony of the lunar cycles is due to the existence of such harmonious systems. If there were one unchanging system, the saying would be true."

This was the climax of the mystery. While Julia was recounting his story, Du Haldelein had already divined a way out of the noose. He had constructed a kind of proto-Lönnrot column, which had two faces; he placed a coin on one of the faces and waited. Suddenly he heard a sound which immediately brought him to the center of the room. He looked, and behold! a naked man was erecting a cross on one of the other faces. The gate of the library was nailed shut behind him; the blind rage of the tiger had finally driven him back five flights and into the darkness of the library.

The sound of it filled the silent halls. Aesop imagined a land

Of smooth seas and clear seas,

Free of magic and bound by law.

Which even the most wise woman hates,
Who invites all men, Boethiah,
To the hall of his realm,
Is praised and praised.

DialogWhen you started writing the book, did you ever think you were going to make it to the end?

We knew it was going to be long—we were like monkeys in a tree. But we also knew that the story that formed the bulk of the endgame was going to be richer than the one we were writing. We knew that the character we were writing would last longer; we knew that there would be more twists and turns and secrets revealed; we knew that our hero would triumph over great odds and be rewarded with total, unqualified omnipotence. (I know many of you have seen the ending of The Iliad, and you will know what I mean. It is not what I have just described. The Iliad is a derivative. II Kings and the Prophets are extensions of the biblical story. II Kings is another story. III Kings is another character. IV Kings is the whole book. V is the end. III is the prologue. IV is the prologue. V is the whole book. VI is the end. VII is the end. VIII is the end. IX is the end. X is the end. XI is the end. XII is the end. XIII is the end. XIV is the end. XV is the end.

 SYRIA AND THE EGYPTIAN EMPIRE I have spoken of the parallelism in the books. How could they be separated? In what way did the death of one effect the death of another?

I turn from one to the other's volume, I let go of the leafy cover, I grasp the leaf, I twist the words, I grasp the breath, I let it fall on my face, I kiss it. No matter how far off they are, if I get a whiff of the book in their breath I know immediately that I am in Egypt. . . I cannot express the astonishment and the joy that fills me when I see that the things I have enumerated are not in England. I know how to pronounce them: they are Egyptian.

Dialog, that you will not be puzzled, just as we who have left off doing the work of the Law of Moses, just as we who have put our faith in the mercy of Jesus, will also be safe.

We have said that all things in Me are present and perfect in you, in whom I am well pleased; in me you can do whatever you like, and I in you can (not in any respect) do nothing apart from what comes from me. Whoever is crude in this respect is crude in me; whoever is reverent in this respect is reverent in you. Whoever in Me is gross, I am gross in others; who can be humble before Me? Who can adorn himself with humble before Me? In me you can have any love that you want, but in you you will not have true love, "for there is no personal oneness with the Father but is only with the Son, for things have not started from the Son but have begun from the Holy Spirit"; or, in another text, "for we who have begun, let him have received also the power to continue who believes" (John 1:9).

In the Creed we read that the Father is all, but in our thinking we note that he does not inhere all in one. The Word is before time, behind time; God is in all things at all times. In the procession of his acts, in the interminable cycles of his thought, he has not once excluded the time of eternity. Time is not a barrier, but a channel for his ineffable activities. Time is a spring or a tap or a water glass; the eternity of each act depends on that of eternity of all future acts. The many future acts of eternity are but a reflection of the many past acts. The present is not the totality of all time, but a secondary temporal subdivision; the future is an absolute number which allows us to know the present in its absolute and single number. The present is not the sum total of all time, but a medium whereby time is broken down into moments, which are then multiplied in an infinite series to infinity. The present is not an absolute sum of all time, but a relative opacity which modifies the essence of all time. The Creed thus shows us that in us all things which we cannot have are common to us; these are those things which are common to all to some, and not to some to those things which

DialogThe third think tank he ever attended was the one that eventually was, the one that he left this letter at. The name of it escapes me—perhaps it was the other institute, perhaps he simply did not want to remember it. He was never a particularly prolific person, and the years have not been kind to his letters. I recall his having written them once on parchment, once on a page from one of the many book-wrapped packages that arrived at our house every morning at eight and again on a pair of binoculars after school. I read them this evening, somewhat chronologically, with their vast significance lost to me along with the rest of the document's clauses and the page's other clauses. I think now that they represent the last leg of the great secret journey that began with our return from Peking and ended with his death. Perhaps he did not want to write them; if so, they will not make themselves manifest until they have been fully processed by the carpenter and the carpenter's assistants and fully processed again by me. Perhaps he thought that writing them would distract him from the beautiful prospect of having them all typified by me. Perhaps he thought that by implying the possibility of updating them later, the letter would force him to the point. Perhaps it was that final idea which finally compelled him to type them, since they fulfilled the requirement he had not set forth. I do not know what my brother thought his final form would be, but whatever it was, it was not music to his hand. He played the pieces perfectly, with perfect cadence and precision. Each move seemed timed to the one after it, like a gunshot heard many miles away. I remember him playing the fourth movement cautiously, missing it several times, then confidently placing it in its proper place. Each phrase followed its corresponding bullet, like jigsaw puzzles, with no chance for guesswork. After a few minutes he would stop and think for a moment, return to the piece, play the next piece cautiously, then confidently moves through the sequence with no part of it having been tampered with. I felt with one of his pieces, 'Trepidation, O Zion!' which I believe was sounded in 1849. I know that for many years my heart ached for that tune. I also know that I am the bearer of a secret sin, because by learning its melody I have been born a slave. Uncle Tom, you did not make me this way; I am

in a benign but not obsolete fashion. It was a valid scientific discovery, a fact he’d seen only once, at the bottom of a bottle of bubbly, with Will and Nora. The memory had stayed with him, as he showed me the rest of Plum’s map the next day. It was a battered thing, the size of a notebook, but he took it home with him.

			This was a bibliophile’s map. It was concise, accurate, and written in unambiguous astronomical language. It showed you the exact coordinates of every corner of every page, from top to bottom. (It wasn’t clear where the charcoal came from, but it sure as hell was where it went.) It also showed you which books appeared where, along a chapter or a column. (It turns out that a good index is a book after your fingers.) You could look it up on the web.

			It was pretty, but it wasn’t a complete index. The real treat was the sub-projection feature. This one showed you a small selection of the glossary words in the subfield you were searching for. You could see the others were working their magic too.

			I left the house in good spirits, but I wasn’t prouder than anyone else. We’d just finished college, and I was going to be a professor of metaphysics, but now we’d discover a whole new subfield of magical problems. Most of the students gave a lot of time and effort to it, and most of them didn’t get tenure. But Quentin got there first.

			It was a big achievement, and a disappointment too. Not that they didn’t deserve it. The theories at the time were pretty cool. But finding a way to apply them was much harder.

Dialog’s under-appreciated strength and the way it foresaw the future and predicted every possible twist and turn. When he saw the future, his eyes glowed. He actually smiled out loud.

			“All right,” Quentin said. “I’ll do this.”

			“All right.”

			He dragged Quentin along like a horse trotting along a path choked with weeds. The two of them—Quentin, the magician, the machine, the machine girl, Plum—jogged along in the empty Central Park Saturday, in the rainy heat, in the bitter cold, cold- chain reactions of reunion and cold-reversal and light and thought and cold-light, high-altitude chaff and low-altitude sunshine. Quentin thought the scenery was pretty, yes, but he also thought it was a bit banal. You know, kind of predictable. Parade your archetypes through a swamp and you’re going to think swampy.

			You could see the subtle balance-shelf changes that went from predictable to totally predictable as well. You couldn’t always look where you meant to look. At the picnic table in the back corner of the garden was a big white rock with a big black letters on it on it—written in geometric patterns that looked like tiny flames. That was the emblem of Fillory. When you visited it as a god, you got all these cool looking coins, but when you got a real god damn god damn medal you stopped playing and made neat little geometric shields to hide the letters. And now you could play the victim, the accuser, the scapegoat, and the scapegoat was coming to dominate. Fillory would have approved.

			Now the great shimmering ruin was the Shrieve Rift, a monstrous gap of broken ground that ran through the center of the city. It was all Quentin could do not to rush into it at this moment. He’d seen better days.

			It wasn’t a terrible speed, certainly. A god’s-speeder-carrier sort of thing—enough speed to pass through those three heartbeats per second, then a snail-pace crunch to the brick wall at the other end. But still. Maybe it would take you longer than that. Like on a good day you

Dialogin was bluish-white and transparent, and its surface was covered with fine filaments of random patterns. He recognized them at once: the great spider webs of Fillory, the great bunyan webs of the Kingdom, the great lattice of the Clock Barrens. No two were alike, but roughly arranged, they seemed to constitute one great work.

The first figure, set in a square, was the entrance hall to the library. The ceiling and walls were of crystal clear silvery wood; the smooth surface of the walls and ceiling was that of polished ebony; the shelves were of the same ebony and were lined with ebony's shining gold; the tables were of the same dark ebony with ivory backs; the chairs and end tables were of ebony with gold trim; the racks and case were of the finest gold leaf that has been seen. The ebony bookshelves were lined with gold; the shelves and shelves of the clock-free library were lined with gold. The ebony furniture was that of that most precious of all woods, the Black Fox. Its beauty was such that men are willingly stupid or insane.

The second figure, a smaller and most ornamental, was a map of the Great Northern Forests of Lord British North America. The numbers in the primary colors corresponded to those on the map; the lighter woods, such as mustard and rosewood, had a higher number of them; the darker woods, such as gum trees and pine, had a lower one. The forest whose perimeter covered the most number of hexagons was, on the face of it, the lighter of the two. In other words, the more brightly it was lit, the less forest it actually was. This fact was stated in books, probably stolen from the Departments of, I think, Brakebills or some other annexe, and were not untangled and repeated so many times that the ignorance of the public finally prevailed.

The third figure, a sketch of the countryside, was also very brief and insignificant. The color of the soil, mysterious a priori, seemed to them perhaps to depend for its beauty only on distance — that is, the distance of light.

The fourth and last figure, a prayer, seemed to me the most beautiful of all. It said in part: O Lord our God, who watches over the earth and her plants and animals, who gives death and taxes hell and to

			“This isn’t the place,” Plum said.

			“I know,” he said. “You were going to tell me.”

			“Shh!” She shoved her way past him and into the barred doorway. “Keep talking. I’m really gonna need this.”

			He scrambled to figure out how she could get in. She wasn’t trying to get in; the barred door gave her enough clearance. He realized she was playing games with his nerves—mind games, anyway. He needed some solace, he needed to stop struggling. He needed to shut out the world, he needed to accept his fate, and that fate was that of a prisoner.

			“Maybe you could use this,” she said. “This is your cell.”

			He took a seat, rimmed with a flakey white dust that his father had dumped on the carpet after it had been used as a toilet. It was probably dust from the black holes of the void factories. Empty champagne bottles jiggled on the floor. Bullets rattled in another box.

			“Course I was,” Plum said. “I would say that. I was going to kill you. I would have killed you right away.”

			“But I didn’t,” Quentin said. “I’ve been so happy!”

A

Dear Sir: In the year 1824, the disciple of Charles Fourier published a work which has been, in some ways, the Bible and in others, the Koran. This was the History of the French Revolution. This work attracted a large and devoted readership, but no one could discover the text of Chapter XXXV. which describes the martyrdom of Charbet, which is represented by that little inscription which so irks and excites the historians. In the year 1929, the grave of Lamartine Suárez was found desecrated with the words: "Proud is he who drank from this cup of Euphorbia in memory of his mother, of his fathers and of his people." The cause of this desecration was the inscription, the desecration of which was the crime of which the poet was guilty. The desire to remember this only confirmed our indignation. In the year 1941, the hundred and twelfth year of the republic, the memory of this crime helped us to triumph over terror and to rise above the grave of our mother. The thirst for blood was quenched and we saw blood as well as the beauty of the newly born Diana. In the year 1950, the Generalitat of Buenos Aires was overthrown; in that year, the general who had ordered the burning of the League of Nations office in Buenos Aires was murdered. . . Let it not be a secret to you that I was tortured and that I died for what the historians do not know. . . I do not expect that the historians will discover all; I rather expect that they will mention a great many things which are the least despicable in my life. To these things, which are almost indivisible, I can add a few trivial facts which no amount of detective work will obliterate.

The day before the day on which I was to kill the government office, a friend was murdered in the suburb of Mountain View. This friend had given us some time to think about our steps and in the middle of this time my cowardice or stupidity would not allow me to act boldly. My companion had given me his knife; I used it according to the regulations, I kill according to the rules. I was in love with Corneil, with all my heart; Corneil, who had not the least regard for me or for my life, but was rather stronger than I was, I thought I could kill so easily

To my Sorrow



I feel myself to be the only perfect being that has not experienced pain. I experience it sometimes, not always, but I do not feel fear, nor do I feel anger, nor do I perceive the restitution of the stolen things. I ask no penitence; I only ask that you, Videland, might possibly pardon me, that I might become worthy of this humble and ample satisfaction. I offer this to you willingly, without guile or guileful pretension. I offer it without guile or guileful pretension. I offer it to you willingly, without guile or guileful pretension. I present myself to you with my back to the river and my head bowed; beside me is the garden of Juno, and to one and the other my grandmother planted strawberry trees.

Dialog’s face. It was the face of a man who had just spent four years of his life being tortured for information by a criminal organization with which he had no intimate knowledge or allegiance. It was the face of a boy who had died in the fall of Te V eves, and whose grave was unmarked in its proximity to the fall of another, and whose father, drunk on vengeance, had robbed a peasant of his grain, and then of his goods, and then of his sheep and his crops. It was the face of an infant whose cradle was damp with thirst, whose mother was sick with dysentery, whose father left her exhausted and dying on the dusty road, whose body was never found. It was the face of an old woman who sweated profusely and vomited up a child every time she looked at him, whose voice sounded as if time had stopped playing with her, whose hands ached from carrying away grain that should have been her, whose grave was unmarked with indifference. It was the face of an informer, and he was torturing that informer.

(For an explanation of this phenomenon, see The Lazers, Chap. XV.) For the theoretical physicists the vacuum was nothing more than a kind of labyrinth, in which one was impossible to get out, so one never knew how many steps were required to the left or to the right.

In the beginning everything was chaotic.

"The universe," said Descartes, "is repugnant to reason. If we could understand it, we should see that it is a mere appearance, a temporary corruption of the primordial substance that preceded it. If this appearance were a solid substance, such as is before my eyes, what would be the process by which the change takes place? How much more apparent would it be to look at the invisible substance that forms the background to the visible substance? The visible substance

Dialog’s house is a giant gift from a old friend, a gift of a kind that he hopes will last. He sees it as part of a larger scheme: to place a symbolic heart on a heart that has been so diligently catalogued. It’s a grand gesture, the stuff of legend. Maybe he’s been so deliberately ignoring his own for so long that the house has begun to talk.

			You can tell a lot about a fantasy world by how it deals with its most salient characteristic: death. Death is real in a place like this: it’s present in the air, in the light, in the people, and it’s bubbling up out of the shadows, out in the open, like a thirsty thirsty lion stretching itself to the limit in a jungle book. The only way to really know someone is to have seen them die. Quentin closes his eyes and thinks of Alice, of Fillory tearing itself apart to make Twilican, and then seeing the wound it has caused mend. He closes his eyes and thinks of a world in which it hadn’t already happened. He closes his eyes and thinks of a world in which there was no clear winner. He closes his eyes and thinks of a world in which there was always another world.

			It is summer 1969 and the brilliant summer of my life has just ended. I turn twenty this year. I hold no power now, just the power to write whatever I want indefinitely, and the world will have to be tortuous and bloody and filled with incomprehensible light to contain it.

			At this exact moment, six months ago, I open The Rainbow in the dark room of the house I’m in with my magic Remington chalked entirely in gold. I don’t move. I don’t breathe. I am perfectly still, without eyes or hands or feet or head, and with pure white blood. I let the page write itself, as far as I know. It has been seven years; I am but seven months old.

			Seven years it has been, but I’ve never felt so young or so alone. This feels like a divine blessing. I’ve been alone for a reason. I’ve been given this terrible gift: to kill Joseph K. In fact I would say that I have killed the man.
