Promptly afterwards they had to stand around in the rain, waiting to get back on the plane. The plane had to be kept from the elements. The luggage carriages had to be kept from tipping over. They stood around for half an hour, with no idea what would happen next. Eventually Janet got up and left.

			“I feel stupid,” she said. “I feel like we went from Blekinge to Düsseldorf.”

			“I know,” Plum said. “But it’s different with Us.”

			“I know,” the bird said, “but what if We are the ones who are applying these rules now?”

			“What if We’re not?”

			“Then who is?” Betsy said.

			The meeting ended abruptly. The bird looked around: a lot of birds in the lounge. It flew off, without further discussion.

			“What a bunch of teenagers,” Betsy said.

			She should get out, she thought, but she couldn’t quite place what it was it was wanting. No order came up, no directive. Liberty was Randall’s game. She got the sense that this particular game was lost between herself and the girl, and now she was coming to terms with the fact. She was letting go, letting go of all the constraining influences in her life, and at the same time she was losing her mind. This was her chance to change her mind, to rebel against everything she’d ever thought and believed and hoped and prided herself on being. What she’d ever wanted, what she’d always dreamed of, what she’d ever tried to make her, was gone now. She was miserable as she was being spirited away, and she wasn’t sure if she’d ever felt it at all. It was like she’d never been back. She’d just been away for a long, long time.

			At the back of her mind a part of her wanted to turn and run, while she was at it, but she couldn’t. What good was a librarian anyway? What good was a rebel? She couldn
====================
Promptly followed the first letter of the alphabet, which was the last one of the series, ending in a Z. Then came the second letter of the series, a Z, which in turn was followed by a T, which in turn was followed by another T, ending in an L. Thus the series grew. The first volume was a few sentences, words or paragraphs, but later on a whole book, a half-complete work. Hugo continued:

... the first phenomenon which strikes the spectator is not the succession of simple verbal symbols, but the dizzying variety of their adornment. There are touches of Latin and Greek, of ancients unknown to him, of words whose meanings are still discernible, of phrases whose meanings have been partially deciphered. There are also extravagant nominal expressions which do not cease to amaze me. . . There are metamorphoses which leave the reader speechless, and which, though they baffle, somehow bring back to him or her, and sometimes even surpass, the form of the scene, the language of the metamorphosis. These latter words are perhaps the most vivid and the most lucidityeshiful of all my tricks. They bemeauret his motive force, his intention of man. He employed it as he would a secret weapon. He constructed for the occasion what the spy would construct for the scene. . . Metaphors, ideas, ideas which seem to be simple to the mind of the reader, are easily the most mysterious things a man will see metamorphosed. He sees in one writing a likeness of another, a simile or an simulacrum. He sees a lion which is a metaphor of the Greek god of war, or a lion which is a caricature of the Egyptian god of the underworld. He sees a king who is a simile of our king. He sees a prophet who is a simile of our prophet."

Amongst the books Hugo lectured was that of Plato, who being then intimate with Aristotle, sought to model his actions upon those of Plato, and taught that all men are jointly mortal and that the actions of one do not divide mankind, but that that of another, that of a god. I have compared this to a blind man who carries around around him a lit match, and using it each time he would say, "Present the match," "Pour the wine," "Sequel: the label of Capulet." The effects produced
====================
Prompted by the exigencies of the mission, the council decided to postpone the decision. They appointed a postponement, an extraordinary postponement. The action was postponed until tomorrow. The reason was given, I remember: to consider the circumstances of the deceased and the various units which had just undergone his inspection. I understood him to mean that it was not proper to discuss the detailed plan of the new settlement, or even of the reorganizations which were taking place in the cities. After much discussion, the members of the council decided (I am not unmindful of the small defects) that it was better not to speak of what had happened, and to remember only that everything was proceeding according to plan.

This plan, which we marked with ourovalated from our minds, was followed by our ancestors, and we, the members of the future council,remain under their rule. If everything goes according to plan, everything, our great leader assured them, because I see you too are feeling the same way. I understand that you too have been affected by the terrible events of the last few days. Perhaps your hope of rest will give way before our strength. I know that for you it is even more difficult to sleep.

I leave the following words of exhortation by Hladik, printed inthe Irlandische Zaitung, to be a prologue to another work.

I am ready, in case any one has doubts as to the authenticity of these words,to translate them.

Marcel Proust

Paris, 24th of February, 1944

DEAR COLLECTOR:

I have read the first part of the article, and in particular chapter one, and can say that I do not think it is plausible that the saint who composed it could not have been aware of the French language. I think it is plausible that, at some time in the past, this same man could have come into contact with the poetic expressions used in the article, and not have known them. I think it is plausible that, in some way, he could have inspired them. I also think it is plausible that, some day in the not too distant future, someone -- let us say, the year 1939 ― can translate those words and, through a process of elimination which will seem paradoxical to the reader, through the eyes of this reader, the articles articles words and its expression. I do not see any proof
====================
Promptly, the event took place. It was a Sunday, the fourth of June, and the children of that day were attending the football match between a Protestant family and the Catholic family of Cachorro. The match was going well, the players were highly esteemed, the atmosphere was enchanting. In the locker room, apart from the two teams, others as well as spectators were playing; a good many boys and girls began doing so as well. One of the girls went straight to the changing room, as if she were going to the toilet, and found Mr. García Pangilinan, second in command of the house, already there. She did not know him; she did not know anything about the book, and she found him very kind and attentive. But she did not know him well. She had not seen him since the 30th of novembre. He introduced herself: he was the same man who a few moments before had greeted her at the door of the house, and she had greeted him at the door of the house, and they had been lovers once too. He was José María Noriega, former president of the Philippines. He was very merry, very charming, very beloved. He told her that the police, the military and the Asiatic experts had concluded that the bomb the Noriega family owned was worth a ton and that they had to burn it immediately, on the spot, under the exact conditions prescribed by law.

It was impossible that this book should contain all the forbidden book words. It was written by men like ourselves, men who had to study it under the exact same conditions, under the exact same conditions. . . I looked at the contract, and on page 14 it said that if the coins were uncopied the burned coins would be refunded. Before that day I had not known who Orson Welles was, but I knew that he was a notorious man, who had been imprisoned many times, most of them for his political beliefs, most of him for his laziness and corruption. I knew he had been to Siberia, I knew he had been to Jamaica, I knew he had been to Bohemia. In those forbidden pages I read that I was to meet Welles in a dream, in the very heart of Spain. It was enough for me to believe in that belief, in that person, and to hate that person, and to want to kill that person.
====================
Promptly, I was dragged back to the city. I do not know how many days it took me to get here. I wanted to write something, but I could not think of anything. Then I remembered that I was in a dream and fastidiously avoided writing anything at all.

I do not know how long I am in this garden. In the beginning I am the black slave who dreamed about gold. Now I am the dog who dreamed about a golden trap. When I wake up, I will know whether I am the slave who dreamed about a trap or the freed man who dreamed about a trap.

Deleveraging and then gambling have always been a part of my life. My father, my mother, my brothers and I used to go through a stage in the weaving of our lives, a stage of bargaining, when one day a kick in the shin woke us up and forced us to act. That was in the beginning; in the second stage, I am in the grip of Don Quixote. I watch the passes I have crafted and break them. I withdraw; Hector punches, the ropes unravel.

Then I will fight as before, with the same small, fierce heart that won the duel. I will pound the peasant with the long sword, with the line I fashioned to break his neck. I will face God, with my back straight and my face hidden from the moon. I will cry Güero, with blood streaming from my lips, with blood in my hands, and God will reward me in kind.








Averroe, Septentrional and Asenfusz



Averroques speak Avestan and Armenian and do not forget that they are also priests of the god. They also speak Averroodic and that they are abominable Traditionally, Averroques have traced their descent to the Sassanides, one of the six children of Shekhar, king of the Gandharvas. As a result of this genealogy, which goes back to the second century of the Indo-Aryan calendar, 90 percent of the priests of the lord are Averroologists. The others are historians, astrologers, mystics, mediums, carpenters, carpentersmiths and tanneries men. The latter few are more or less on the orthodox side. The reasons for which they have chosen the path of chastity
====================
Prompted by a sudden burst of wind, the lorry began to roll down the narrow A1A1 road. Quentin pricked his neck with aiee, and the door smashed heavily open, a metal grille paring off from the glare of the opening laser sight.

			“Shit.”

			Lorian (with characteristic sarcasm) jammed the gunwales. It took him five tries, but the spell triggered. Wind blew everywhere, and the sky lit up with broken torches. Stoppard was down—she’d managed to twist his belt into a snake, and he’d gone through the grating first. The impact was loud, like an artillery shell exploding in the distance.

			“Shit,” Plum said. “Shit, shit, shit.”

			The spell slammed shut automatically, and there was a soft buzz as the belts pulled the wind out of the air. Stoppard’s halberd-thing surged forward, drawn automatically—it was loaded with new, shiny steel.

			“Attention, recruits!” Betsy shouted. “Attention, warriors-in-training!”

			An instant after Betsy shouted, the door burst open on its side. The stolid looking young man in the halberd-dress standing on the threshold stepped forward to welcome him.

			“Mr. Prince,” he said.

			“Your name is Eliot?” Quentin asked.

			“Yup. Where’s your full name?”

			“Full of shit?”

			“Nope. Just Eliot.”

			“I know you’re new,” the other man said, “but how did you get here? At the Rococo? From the future?”

			“Same as me. Went by a few names last time. Different cities. Different masters. But we called them Quentin. The books were wild in California, but it’s rare to get here by ship. Edward called it’s coast too.—

			The other man seemed unperturbed. Eliot could see the quandary in Quentin’
====================
Promptly, the two men stood up. Now it was Sparrow’s turn to stand up.

			“All right?” Janet said. “All right?”

			“You know, I had a feeling you might.”

			“With what?” Poppy said. “I have a lot of questions.”

			Somewhere in the middle of this everyone started humming Cherub’s Song again.

			“Hey!” Poppy said. “That was really weird.”

			Says the shy one had a thing for the loud!

			“Yeah. I liked it when he stuck his tongue out like that.”

			“That was just—"‘a thing,"’ Janet said.

			“A thing!” Poppy said.

			“‘kind of disgusted me,’ she said, ’but you get my point.’’

			“I did,’ Janet said.

			“After that it was more or less part of who I was. I suppose it helped that he was white. White are the races I have rescued. Probably even white magic comes with a black undertow, and I was lucky enough to pick up a few eggs of Cloven Waltz, the black magic of a slave trader. After a while I began to realize that these were not the intractable eccentricities of stereotype. These were persons—people with whom I was otherwise at variance, persons—who were specially adapted to their feral state, and were best adapted to be human beings in that state.

			“Why would a guy just an antechamber want to talk?” Poppy asked.

			“To find out.”

			“How so?”

			“How come you think I can find your stuff?”

			Janet tried to ignore the fact that Poppy was standing 6 foot 3 and surfing on all fours with an entire industry of pubes. She was focused on the game she was blitzing, and she had a lot of friends in Chester who knew a thing or
====================
Promptly and without warning, Breeze's breath caught in his throat. He realized he had been poisoned. He had been conned.

			For a long moment nothing happened. Quentin stared at the floor. He considered taking a swig from the flask, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He didn’t dare look away, not after what had just taken place.

			“Quentin.” Stoppard came trotting up behind him. “It’s time you ate. We had enough time to plan this, put this plan together. You should have seen the hunger in your eyes after that fight. You must have been sick of the food, seeing all these starving filly thingies, when you poisoned Janet. You could still be hungry, but you had something else badly wrong.”

			Quentin didn’t know what to say. He had a feeling he’d offended Stoppard, though he could never quite place the cause. Or perhaps it was the effect. Maybe having offended him had made him unhinged. Before he could even say anything, however, Plum spoke up.

			“I have to go,” Stoppard said. “I’m out. I’m fine. Just come get me when you can.”

			“When?” Quentin said. “When do you think he’ll come back?”

			“When he punches him in the face!”

			“That’s what I figured,” Plum said. “I figured he would. When he gets back. I hope he’s OK, though. I just hope he’s not—"

			“Shutup!” Stoppard slapped him hard across the face with the back of his hand.

			“Shutup!” Plum slapped him back down. No effect. “I’m fine. I’m just fine.”

			Quentin walked over to Plum and put a hand on her shoulder.

			“It’s not that simple,” he said.

			“The cure isn’t going to be
====================
Promptly after the last of the Tusk Men were executed, a man of about my age or thereabouts came running up to our door carrying a crate. He looked perfectly sober, and I recognized him from before. He was the one who'd run our gold search.

			“The hell? The Tusk Men?”

			“They were you,” he said.

			“Yeah,” he said. “I was you.”

			He was right, he had been him. It had been him all along. Now his features were paler, his skin translucent, but he was still the same height as he had four hours ago.

			He opened the front door as Plum and I returned to the second-floor study. The sun was already setting on Plum’s brave display, and Quentin was beginning to tire too. The last of the night had passed off peacefully, but then tonight was different. This man was stronger than he looked like, and he had more power than he looked like. This was not a man struggling from harm’s way. This was an enforcer, and an evil lord, cast off into the sunset by the stars.

			The man who had come earlier than the others went over Quentin’s story, in case he was the man he seemed to be. Quentin didn’t know him, but he knew the Divide, and that river, and the Work, and that river. The night before, on the second day, Quentin had stopped him on the platform and told him about his family, and what had happened at the zoo.

			The man hadn’t doubted Quentin’s story, but he hadn’t believed it either. It bothered him, and now he did, but the memory hadn’t sickened him. It had only made him more urgent, and direct—he felt the Divide pressing down on him like a heavy suitcase, and he had to fight to break out of it. He felt himself frantically trying to reach the magical connection the man had described, feeling as if it were part of a fragile, absolute thing that he, as an individual, should secure by force.

			But where to? The man pointed to a corner of the room. Quentin squinted and saw a coin tucked away in

Prompted by a sudden burst of sparks, the ceiling of the car exploded in sparks and stones. The two halves of the car came crashing down on top of each other, and sparks flew everywhere.







Lemonadescence



It is said that in ancient Greece the moon was the reflection of the sun; in China, the sun and the moon are the universe and the universe is the moon. To Moria it seems inexplicable that the universe and the moon, which are two facets of the same face, should have given rise to a religion and a religion to beings who had nothing to do with the moon. In Portugal it has been said that the worship of the moon was common in the oldest tribes of Mexico; that the practice of astrology was invented by the Spaniards; that in Angola the moon is a parasite of the sun; that in South America the Spaniards had no other religion than History, because they had converted the Indians, who knew nothing else, to their faith. In Brazil, where the religion of the Aztecs is the same as that of the Spanish, this curious dogma was affirmed by priests and mystagogues. Invented by the Spaniards for the Spaniards, said the people. Invented by the priests. And now the priests have discarded it. They have discarded it because it is useless and insufficient; because it is less vague than the many images which they have encouraged the Indians to worship; because it encourages them to wait for the hour of triumph, which will not yet arrive; because it encourages them to await the triumph of an image which will, and that they may suffer for its inefficiency and its absence of holiness. History does not interest the priests, history serves anticipation and fear. History interest us, history makes us wait in suspense, wait in horror, wait in dread, in order that the hour of triumph may not be distant.

====================
Prompted by the sudden appearance of a dog, I took a handful of its fur from its collar. Instinctively, I touched the sound with my ear. I could not have asked for anything more beautiful than to be startled by a canine howl, then suddenly silenced by its creator. Then I was the only one in the house.

Eyes open, heart rate quickened, body eager for fresh associations, body language spectacular, body language virtuosos, we all join the pack. We all remember those days, the first time we felt the pushing and pulling and friction of a great machine that was trying to push us backward and away from it, forward and inside its enclosure. We all remember that instant with an almost religious nostalgia. Perhaps then we will never know if Anki was a wise decision. Perhaps now we will never know if Anki was the best decision.

Perhaps now we will know if the decision of accepting Anki was the best decision possible.<|endoftext|>Image copyright EPA Image caption The court heard how the statue had been defaced with racial and religious epithets

A Chinese-American artist who built a $150m (£93m) art collection in New York has been sentenced to death for the 1994 bombings of the US Naval Academy and the World Trade Centre.

Rafael Nadal, 32, and his then-girlfriend, Lindsey Vonermiller, 30, killed themselves as they deliberated over the sentences.

Nadal had previously appealed the sentences, arguing that the crime was not racially motivated but rather retribution for his alleged role in the 1999 US arrest and imprisonment of Chinese billionaire Bo Xilai.

Bo was convicted of fraud and sentenced to three years in prison; Nadal was convicted of violating his official duties but acquitted of the bombing charges.

Bo died in custody in January of this year, just days before he was due to face the jury in his death penalty trial.

Analysis Since Bo's conviction, he has been the object of intense prejudice and a lot of hatred. Many people suspected him of being responsible, at least in part, for the fate of the Chinese community in Manhattan Beach, California, in the southern part of the country. This was the site of the murder trial of Mr Bo, in which nineteen members of the Hsiao Ai family were convicted in 1999. Bo Xilai was one of the accused. Some

Prompted by the news that his father had been murdered, Yeager began to reflect on his own father, who had taken his own life a few days earlier. The incident had dramatically altered Yeager's character and prefigured the fundamental conflict that his Autobiography would later identify with the novel of the same name. An avid reader of Spengler and Kierkegaard, Yeager could report that the book "gave him pain and confusion." He went on:

I read it once and then forgot it for a week. Then I came back to it in Friday the eighth and again on Saturday the ninth. Each time with less and each time with less. I finally managed to decipher what the book said and came away with a few words of apology. Then I went over the text with a new eye and again with a stone-hard one. I couldn't understand a word. It all looked the same to me, a mountain range with a house on top. That was how it all unfolded to me. . . My father was a quality writer who could write anything you wanted him to write; but he could also write worse. I remember one of the first chapters, where he had our names changed—Eliot and Nancy Yeager, as they came to be known—simultaneously for the sake of brevity and out of habit. He was always changing his names, and I used to go to the library to find a new edition of the Encyclopaedia Scholastica.

Then came a week in which it was very difficult for a man of genius to come into contact with reality. For that reason it is very strange that Yeager should have concentrated so long on the problem of writing and not on his other activities. Perhaps he thought that if he solved his dilemma he would be done with literature and free to pursue other endeavors. Perhaps that was his plan. If so, he was mistaken.

Then there was the matter of the money. He had saved enough for many years, perhaps even for all of humanity, but the years were up, and the hour had not been called by day. He worked forty hours a day, but the money was due on the third. If he did not act now he would act later, more than his years, his days, the years he had worked so hard to become. If he did not, he would pay a terrible price for his cowardice. What now? He
====================
Prompted by the unexpected revelation that the woman who had launched into a verbal tirade against the flora and fauna of all languages was, in fact, a fallen angel, Quentin and Plum returned to the library. The women had departed again; the second floor was open to the elements. Plum entered through an ice cave and fell through the floor, hard, onto the uneven stone. Her clothes were dry, but she noticed first that her shoes were cold, and then that they were no longer of the brown leather she had worn at the beach.

			She turned slowly, took a breath, and paced. These women were much larger than they looked, and even more frightening in person. They had manes, and sharp teeth, which Plum latched onto as soon as they came across. She wondered if they were hunting them. If she was going to live, she would have to fight them.

			She wondered if Eliot would join her. He would have to stay at Brakebills to take up his duties as head of the Thieves' Union, but he would have other things to think about. Eliot would have people to talk to, people to defend him, and he would need someone to fight. And whoever won, it would be that much better for it.

			Plum wondered what Eliot would wear. Would he be decked out as the archetypal wizard? A dark lord of the deep? She hoped he would have at least one nice thing going. It was a bit much to ask that he wear an arah mask, especially when the arah were actual people.

			They were still a ways from the rooftop, though, and Plum wasn’t letting go. Eliot had that look again, the look of a man struggling to rise out of a pit. He was having trouble with the first layer of marble, where he’d laid the base for his arah mask. It was covering his face, and the light was flickering and rippling all around them.

			Plum pulled her head up off the floor and cleared her throat.

			“Plum’s there.”

			“There.”

			Plum looked down at the floor again, felt a little better, and leaned down to take Poppy’s handkerchief out of her hair.

			
====================
Prompted by an explosion, the wall collapsed on him. He was on his hands and knees, knees pressed together, breathing shallow, his shirt torn and hanging by a thread. She pushed a few buttons on the console; a narrow grin broke out over her face.

			“Whoop!” she said. “Nice one.”

			It was a very smart sword. A rare breed indeed.

			“Did you just kill anybody with it?”

			“I just killed their brain.”

			“That’s not how it works!” Plum said. “The computer isn’t a brain. It’s a sword. You’re talking to yourself here!”

			She turned the handle. The light turned red. A few sparks flew, but those sparks weren’t because of the sword—they flew because of the arrival of High King, Rikke, and his entourage. High King! Why were you all of a sudden here? High King, High King, Rikke, High King, High King! Who the hell were you? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King? High King?
====================
Promptly, arched-back, nostril-length nostrils came up to meet them.

			“What the hell are you doing here?” Eliot said.

			A beat of silence followed.

			“I don’t know,” Eliot said, “I mean it’s not like I have all these classes.”

			“Look, we’ll talk about it after we go inside.”

			“We will? OKAY!” The bird raised the door open wide. Everybody except Eliot and Plum.

			He flinched away to one side, as if thrown against the wall by a sudden adult strength contest. Then he straightened up: the lizards were kissing each other now, and going at each other in a ring, and the kiss-kiss went on for what seemed like too long, and Eliot had to stop the kissing to take his hand. When he got back to his feet it was too late. The kiss was over, and they were slapping each other in the face and throat and whatever else remained.

			“Enough,” Eliot said. He gripped Quentin’s hair, and shoved him back. “Enough. You want to fight? Out! In!”

			Quentin gave a choked sound. He wanted to fight, but he was too tired. He wanted to take a knee, and try to pretend he was in some other part of the house, any room, any room at all, like everybody else was doing when they watched the game on television. But he could not. There was nothing there.

Hens were afraid of light. They hardly ever came into contact with people who were naked. When Quentin came into the room the hen had gone from averted gaze to openly hostile. It came closer, and its lip met Quentin’s, white. He felt the Cheshire dog bite into his shoulder. He gave a half-hearted wince and put out a breath. The sting was going away.

The other one came up behind him. He jerked away, alarmed, as if the sting of a thousand steel blades might possibly pierce his thin skin.

			He was almost hit by one of the larger birds, by as much as by a person.
====================
Promptly, the end of the world was upon us. We were all desperately trying to make sense of this vast, unexpected and (we were told) entirely predictable event. As the High King, I had all the authority in the world, and I didn’t want any of it. I got up at seven every morning, drilled until I was red hot, and then went back downstairs until I was a jelly with rage. (Later I discovered that the rage was more than just a physical reaction; it was a moral one, the kind we ascribe to angels and demons. If I won, I would punish them, if they lost, the world would end. If I lost, I would never win. If the world ended, then what was the world made of??)

I made a pact with myself. If Theos breaks the pact, things get ugly. If it refuses to break it, things get stilled. If it agrees to a condition, things progress at a reasonable clip. If it refuses to accept that condition, things get violent. If it accepts it, things get tense. If it rejects it, things get grim. If it conditions it, things get interesting. In Greek tragedy, the Tetrarchs were said to revel in the blood of prisoners, and in the hair of those slain in the war; in our tragedy, the Tetrarchs are said to revel in the blood of the victorious, the haughtiest, the most ridiculous of heroes. In our tragedy, the Tetrarchs are always the most ridiculous of heroes. If Theos broke the pact, things would degenerate to chaos; if it didn’t, things would progress at a normal clip and not degenerate into chaos. So I, the High King, swore by the thunderous name of the Divine to put an end to this, that and the other. I swore to the High King, the clansmen and the dead, to the Lords and the Philistines, that I would have you serve me faithfully. I swore to have Theos Criscus kill the High King, the Clansman and the Prisoner beheaded him, the Philistine and the Hanged beheaded him, the Prisoner and the Philistine beheaded them, the Lord and the Prison beheaded them, the Israelitish and the Aramaicite beheaded them. I swore to have Theos Execute Theos. I swore to have The

Promptly [they came upon] a vast and empty desert, dotted with eucalypti and dotted with star-strewn hills. They passed through a series of stone passunks, which seemed to them vast and secret temples. At last they came upon a simple phalanx of stone walls, some placed in a row, some in a variety of configurations. A group of them were arranged in a semicircle in the center of the desert. A man emerged from one of the stone passunks and turned away toward the eucalypti. Another man emerged from another stone passunk and turned away toward the jungle. A third man emerged from another stone passunk and turned away toward the jungle. A fourth man emerged from another stone passunk and turned away toward the jungle. A fifth man emerged from another stone passunk and turned away toward the jungle. A sixth man emerged from another stone passunk and turned away toward the jungle. A seventh man emerged from another stone passunk and turned away toward the jungle. A eighth man emerged from another stone passunk and turned away toward the jungle. A ninth man emerged from another stone passunk and turned away toward the jungle. A tenth man emerged from another stone passunk and turned away toward the jungle.

Promptly the poet fell to writing. He was meditating a poem of about one hundred stanzas, alloruously divided into three stages, which would avenge the death of a relative or of a relative's relative, which would culminate in the battle of Bosworth Field, which he would endeavour to have his eyes opened and read by, which would be the theme of a tragicomedy of modern times. The third stage would be for the poet to confront the archetypal villain of Germanic or of Celtic blood, bring him before a hero of his own, and have the latter declare his undying loyalty to the fallen enemy. To this last declaration, the poet would add another, which would follow upon it: "I, such are I. . ." This declaration would be quickly supplanted by others, all of them equally awful. The third stage would be fulfilled by another, and another, and a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth, and in the midst of it a seventh, and a seventh (!) would happen ― this continual and constant movement would be the central theme of the drama. There would be eclipses and triple eclipses. There would be eighty stages, and nothing important ever happened in all of them. In one of the earlier poems (which I have forgotten now) Jung had written that everything we have is, or was, something else, and that something else was, or was not, the same thing as something else again and again and again. This idea gave rise to psychoanalysis; it was from this work that the concept of the archetypal was derived.

Jung believed that all things have a symbolic value, since "our thoughts, feelings, images and so on, are products of the visual system and are nothing else than representations of the relations of the external world to our mental systems." Such is symbolarity, but not all things are symbolic. The world is not the crystal labyrinth of dreams of the imagination; all things are so in the eye of man, who has to reason with them in order to enter into their actuality. The doctrine of the Archinomian Complexion of Alice Bailey (an identification of which I shall make some brief narrative recapitulations) has given us some ideas about the problem. She believed that the world is complex; she believed also that the fundamental constants of the universe are not those which Alice herself has discovered, nor those which are theoretically conceivable. Instead, she

Promptly, I did what any self-respecting man would have done: I pulled the trigger.

			My first thought was, of course, "What the hell is that?" And then my second: monstrous. How could some modest guy with a heart and some spare change on me do that? For a start, he wasn’t a magician, he wasn’t even a very good one. He wasn’t even a very brave one either. He wasn’t even a very sharp one. He was a goddamn pistol. But still: what the hell was that? It was a poem. A classic poem. I knew from the title that it was going to be a classic poem, because even though I hadn’t the least bit of intention of inflicting pain or suffering on anybody, I had absolutely no intention of finishing it. (At any rate, if I had it all taken back: I wanted to read it again and again and reconsider every word. It was the last surviving work of St. Augustine I knew of that had not been translated, and it described a sort of bliss that could only come from the absolute absence of sin. I could almost picture the text even then: blissful, expanding, infinite, bright and translucent, echoing through space and time, echoing through eternity, echoing through all of eternity. ) My last thought was: if life is a game, then the game is a complete one. I never understood that until then.

			I was at a loss to understand why anybody should even care about a magnificent poem that has already been faithfully rendered and lost forever. The point of art, I thought, was to make us think, not to make us act. (This led me to argue that no one should try to read Beethoven, for he was a vain man who could not imagine the symphonies of heaven and earth.) And yet: oh, the lessons they teach. That’s what a poem does for us. A poem makes us think. A poem illuminates. A poem is the ultimate autobiography.

			I didn’t even open the book. I didn’t care, I just didn’t want to go through. I couldn’t look at the back, either. The binding wasn’t wrong--it seemed like it came from some other monastery. The dust was

Prompto: You’re freaky like that.

			“I don’t think so.” Poppy leaned forward, meeting Brendel in a small, sympathetic corner of the rug. “Not that I've seen. But I’m guessing it’s because you’re freaky like that.”

			“I thought you’re curious. I’m curious.”

			“I am curious.”

			“What kind of question is that?”

			“I don’t think so we can go into the broad strokes of it.”

			“How long have you been living here?”

			“For what?"

			“Years.”

			“Wait, what? Weeks. Are you sure?”

			“I’m telling you,” Poppy, leaning in to kiss her cousin, “all we asked was a name!”

			“What name is that?”

			“All right, all right.”

			“I don’t know it.”

			“I mean, come on! You wanted a name? Give it to us!” It was being pestered like it was a chocolate cereal box.

			“Well, no,” Poppy said, looking around the room. “I don’t.”

			Janet was doing the talking. She was being firm, which was not in her style, but Poppy got it. She understood now.

			““Ooh,” Janet said. She tapped Poppy on the head with a napkin. “I thought you’d like that.”

			She brightened up when she saw what Betsy had sketched on the back of the scroll. It was a blood-soaked silhouette of a horse.

			“That is exactly what I thought,” Janet said.

			“Well!” Poppy got up and started walking briskly back to her spot on

Promptly, the car began to spin, the tires skidding on rammed-up asphalt. Quentin nodded to Penny, who was still seated in the passenger seat, hands on her head.

			“I’ll come with you,” she said. “We’ll go again.”

			Penny looked pleased but not quite sure what to do. From her expression it should have been clear that she was saying, and she thumbs-uped him affirmatively, this time with a smile. But she just kept rambling.

			“I don’t know,” she said. “Go talk to her. I think that’s all she really wants you to do.”

			“I think she really wants me to go,” Quentin said. “But I don’t know what.”

			“It really bothers me,” Plum said. “When she says it bothered you, didn’t you ever notice that you were getting older? You were old?”

			“Yeah.”

			“I knew I would get old,” Plum said. “I knew. And I sure as hell will.”

			—

			As the train pulled up at the station they both waited in line. Penny went first. He was in terrific spirits, it turned out, and he really did look like he had been sent from another world. He looked so alive, like he’d had a great time of it on the other side! Except for the glasses, of course. He was all business when he went first.

			He took them off in silence. The luxury of the train was his prerogative, but he appreciated Penny’s presence. It was a rare pleasure to be a passenger.

			Penny took out his card and passed to the wheels.

			“The second wheel,” he said, not completely inaudible, “comes from the back. He’s got a theory about why we can’t go more than a few rows behind the front.”

			The train lurched forward, the wheels grinding in the seat behind his, and

Prompted by his friend's death, the teacher of the future felt that he had no other obligation than to finish up the job the man who had started it had started. He did not restrain his tears; his lips were moving in a languorous melodic tritone. He told me that his principal tasks included a study of Latin phrases starting with the vowel L and including -- redundantly -- with whom he had never had contact, with a vowel he thought was another, and with a vowel he thought was none at all. He also promised to have a look at the "Mythography of Death," a collection of astronomical and mathematical calculations intended to explain how the total area of the known universe doubled every 1,000 years. He promised to find a way to let me see it.

In the library you will find a sort of trophy book, originally the curriculum for a competition at Brakebills, now the rage among the students, the library's trophies, birds-and-paper trophies. This is what I was:



Dr. Fergus Ewing,

Fifth-Year Scholar.

You will excuse our brevity, but on the fourth of July, 1882, I was one of twenty-four finalists chosen from across the university by an imperial decree to undergo four months of intensive study and then death.

I speak now of my own miserable trial. The details are hazy, but it was at your college that my destiny linked me to that of those around me. At that time you may recall, in the year 1888, you received my resignation from Brakebills. You will have no reason to recall it to me now, since I leave you in your own year. However, I shall not fail to recall it.

It was at Brakebills that my destiny linked me to that of the hundreds of thousands around me. There were many who considered myself one of them. I was a candidate for the professorships, highly touted, some boasted of a hundred and fifty honors, others twenty. Quite a few of you will have seen my file. Others won Academy Awards. I was the star of the show. I received handsome awards for my stories and performances. I was the only Rhodes Scholar in our graduating class. A classmate of Professor Wallis' who had won a scholarship to Tarry Town said that if my friend won an award then he must be pretty desperate, because if he did not
====================
Prompted by these developments, the committee considered the question of the Alexandrian Monotones. This submissively, because it seemed to it sacrilege to approve them. To the committee's credit, its members (I include them) were men of letters of average intellect, not of earthly ability. They said simply and with some resignationarily: "The Alexandrian Monotones seem almost to be an inverse of Alexandrian Metaphor: they are words whose opposite is very nearly, and yet which exert an influence which no description of the text can possibly approximate." They went on to enumerate a large selection, without adducing the Alexandrian Monotones, and without bothering to elucidate the Alexandrian Roots. They spoke with some relish of the recent "developments" in French literature, and of the "new realism" of Bujold. To these (I know) I added one single important detail: the translation by Jean Paul Sartre of Don Quixote.

It was I, your Humboldtian predecessor, who in the seventeenth century determined that America should have its Marrano Don Quixote, and it was I, not Quixote, who inspired the translation by Paulus Rupe. In your country, Don Quixote stands for the Spanish idealist. In your country, Don Quixote is the name given to that idealist form of literature which seeks to define for our time the characteristics of that age. It is certain to us, we think, because it is seen by us, a sort of biblical record of past ages, though in fact all ages are past to him, all ages are eternal, though we, his own present age. And since all ages are past to him, all are imaginary to him, he has written a work "written in scenes": a phantom age, a hallucination of ages past, a dream or nightmare of an age that is not here, not now, not in the future. The interpretation of this dream or nightmare, of its objects, is outside the province of the present; what is contained in these unreal objects is known to us in the present. We can say with Rupe: I write these words,

because I am

Promptly, a pair of blue eyes, the kind boys get at Privet Drive Academy, popped out of the darkness of the purse. They were happy he’d brought them, as it turned out.

			“I thought you were supposed to bring your friends?”

			“My friends,” he said. “And my dog.”

			“Dudes. What is this?”

			“It’s for the fashion show,” Plum said. “We’ll be there. Right away.”

			Jack unrolled the faded numerical code from his yellow Sharpie. He did it like a magician cutting a cordon around a burning stadium: with his other hand, he loosely formed into a cross a series of numbers that only he could read.

			“Now you know,” he said.

			He focused for a moment on the two dark lines running the length of the back of his chair—the incisions he was least likely ever to make in a suit—and then he stamped his feet and chucked them like soccer goals. They were high kicks.

			“All right,” he said. “All right. I see your point. But my goodness, those are huge.”

			“They’re not really gigantic.”

			“Fine, I get it. I get it. What about you?”

			Jack saw the look on Janet’s face: shock, surprise, fear. He drew himself up and put a hand to his head.

			“I’m sure these are things that everyone’s noticed,” he said. “Like at the beach or after a long day at the office.”

			“That’s true. It is true.”

			“Well, I must admit that the Benjamins was an impressive evening,” Quentin said. “I’m sure Alice would approve.”

			“Thank you,” Janet said. “I didn’t expect to like you.”

			She looked over her shoulder, away

Promptly, we shall demand the return of the book and the condemnation of its scribe who, on its part, committed the greatest blunder of all: he published it, in the presence of all men, and sold it.

The same vanity that gave rise to custom and the forge also gave rise to the ridiculous book. The Florentines, discontented with the impotence of their planters, decided to apply to the Roman Pontiffs the formula of a rule for the guidance of all mankind. The prelate, with unusual facility, replied, in a tone of profound resignation, in which he quite failed to affect resignation, but rather a resolute tone of outrage. . . The prelate predicted, in a word, that all men would act justly, justly for the glory of the gods and of the Punic and Egyptian histories. The Florentines applied to the Roman prelates the formula of a just sentence. The answers were, the Pharsalia, the Aeneid, the Gorgias, thetaphs, the predictions of the sick, the tetrarchies, the predictions of the blind, the plough and the plow, the troglodyte, the fox and the snake, the plow and the plow again, the prediction of the plow, the prediction of the plow, the prediction of the plow, the plow of whiteness, the plow of niffin, the plow of whiteness, the plow of whiteness, the plow of whiteness, the plow of whiteness, the plow of whiteness, the plow of whiteness, the plow of whiteness, the plow of whiteness, the plow of whiteness, the Plinian plow, the Pliny the Elder, the Pliny the Elder, the Pliny, the Pliny the Elder, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the Pliny, the

Promptly, a fountain of huge, round liquid gleamed in the middle of the street. It was blood.

			“Blood for blood,” the voice said. “Run!”

			The dove fluttered down out of the fountain. It landed on one of the paving stones, and its beak grazed the pavement.

			“Run, bird,” Eliot said. He sat down on a stone.

			He didn’t know what to do. He had just about everything under control except maybe the ability to project into the living room. Quentin stared at the stone. The fountain. Janet. Pause. Pray. Maybe he’d go to the library. He stammered: “Eh,” he said. “Eh, me neither.”

			“Well, then. You are hereby called upon to make your choice: to serve or to serve only yourself.”

			Eliot did as he was told. He sucked slowly whatever magicks he had coated his hands in, and whenever he smelled booze or smoke or carbon monoxide he cast a spell over his long face and ate hard candy coated with white gold. The spell would determine after himself. He would make an effort, say he was going to bless it or curse it or do whatever it said. It was entirely up to him what kind of magic he used.

			“Don’t know much about magic,” he said. “Little stuff.”

			“Little stuff.”

			“Small talk.”

			“You want to know about something?” Janet said. “Last time I checked you weren’t talking about it.”

			“Information is power.”

			“Information and power are not the same thing.”

			“Information and power come in pairs: theamplifying and expelling. You’re talking about theother one too,” Eliot said. “Calm down. Nothing great is happening.”

			“What is great about this period is that it is talking about what is great about the world. Look at what is great about

Promptly, this was too much. He turned and began walking away, muttering under his breath to himself, "Why is it that every time I tell you how devastated I am by the death of my brother, you just shrug your shoulders and keep doing what you were doing before?"









Barrens of Paradise



A man was lying in a pool of his own blood; his shirt was bloody too, but it was just water. Those who knew him said he was asleep; those who knew him said he had already died. No one could say for sure how long he had been dead, but the first thing to happen when he came into view was that everyone assumed he had died, even though he was perfectly still and alert and never once moved. Behind him the grass became a net, and in front of him a high wall of cloud. The last rays of morning sunlight began to pour in, leaving behind clouds of black dust. Someone opened the last of the shutters.



At that moment in time everyone lived for a moment in the moment of Leopold Bloom. In the world of dreams he was just a dreamer, in the world of reality an illustrious dreamer. In the novel Einstein was the dreamer, Bloom the murderer. In the barroom quarrel Einstein lost, in the grave he has never been found, and in the songs of today you can still hear the sounds of your childhood. In the lonely ruins of the court Milinda's story is sweet and true, your brother's is monstrous and shameful, and although it is written in ink which after eighty years cannot be erased, my blood still bears your brother's stamp. In the Ethiopian desert you can still see the trail you took to get here, a long burning red trail, and though I am not related to you, I am on your side. I was with you that day, I was with you where you were, I was with you when you were angry, I was with you when you were happy. I was your Ophelia, and I was yourranean. I was your Ophelia, and I was your Ophelia, and I was your Ophelia, and I was your Ophelia. I was your Ophelia, and I was your Ophelia, and I was your Ophelia. I was your Ophelia, and I was your Ophelia, and I was your Op

Promptly, I was up there on the boat with them. The landing party consisted of Quentin, Payette, Plum and me, along with a lanky, bearded guy who went by the handle of the Flintstones. Lionel Shriver was there too.”

			“Little by little, I became more and more certain that I’d gotten it all wrong. The water was the same height all the way; the earth was the same weight; the lag set in. The speed limit was three times the legal rate. And the birds were humans!”

			“How long had they known each other? I mean more than meets the eye?”

			“More than meets the eye. But I assumed they were best buds. I don’t know, they were all jaded the first time around. Quentin got along with Martin very easily; I never saw him do anything so gratuitous as get on a plane with a girl. But she was different. She was different the first time around. She was a niffin the second time around.”

			“Well, second time around is a cheery memory,” Plum said.

			“I sort of look forward to it. What do you think it means, the Upper and Lower Stories?”

			“You’re being too cavalier Janet,” Plum said. “The Upper and Lower Stories is a real weird part of town. You never knew what you were going to find.”

			“No offense,” Eliot said, “but that is a completely valid speculation. We already know that it is Lower Manhattan.”

			“Look at all these teak’s on the floor. We should probably find Alice.”

			“Except that’s not true,” Plum said. “There’s an Alice on the roof,” Eliot added, to Mulga’s approval.

			“Right.”

			They went up to the roof, which of course was a different world from the one they were in. They sat on platforms face to face. The view was absolutely soul-stirring. The view was also completely blocked out by something: a

Promptly, the great hall was filled with people. There were no longer any barriers to those who passed through, or those who tried to stop them. Those who did not wish to be stopped were permitted to pass. Those who did not want to be told their place in the line―that was their prerogative. A few cried out in approval, and the thousands who had gathered around them extended their hands in a grateful welcome. A few cried out in surprise, and the multitude laughed. Someone uttered a groan, and a voice said in a low voice, "Ah, he is dead."

Then the torches burned faint beams of golden light across the floor, and sparks flew. Laughter echoed, and a few voices said in agreement, "I and my fellows know that it is very likely that he is dead," or "It is very likely that he is dead." A few people cried out, "Here he is again!" and on another section of floor, "Here he is again!" And so on to the corners of the hall, which at first one was afraid might be the last. One corner was trodden by two men; the other by a pig. A woman was addressing another; a third by a pigeon. A boy was offering exclamation after exclamation of imminent pleasure; another by some Dickens novel; last, by the weight of his debts. Suddenly a light and almost blinding flash swept through the hall and hung there, flashish and heavy, like the gleam of a candelabra. Clearing away a mass of dust with his cupped hands, the dead man announced, in English and Sinhalese, "The hour has dawned."

No one could better understand the joy felt by the Persians than Hladik. He recalled, with obvious emotion, the epigrams from the Bhagavad Gita, the Sermon on the Mount, and repeated to himself the famous words of the Jinn: "We, the Jinn, are the philosophers of Persia." Suddenly he felt that he could give a definition of philosophy. He remembered Bayle and Russell and Timaeus and Timaeus Quicheras: the early seventeenth-century rationalists who pointed to the discontinuous repeating ratio Q(A)+B as a model of the orderly organization of matter. He remembered also Descartes' dictum that "I do not shrink from perplexity, but am glad to
====================
Promptly after, I was in the same room as a young man of about my own age—not forty, maybe, it was hard to tell—who seemed at first to lack all character dimensions and then to have multiplied them. We were lying on tarpaper beds in a circle, and I held out my hand, just barely, to accept a wristband from the man. He took it with no protest.

I had just become acquainted with the universe on some fateful night some years before, that mysterious nighttime when the stars had not yet risen, and when all the nightquesen was at ease on the outside but revolted on the inside on the brink of panic. The man and I were students, engaged in some basic exercises of critical reasoning. I showed him a tableful of five volumes of weekly and monthly newspaper pages, catalogues, clippings, obscure little books about obscure historical figures that no longer existed, some dated to the middle of the nineteenth century but were in such bad shape that a thief would have to assume their current value to bring them back to us. I told him that there were even extant volumes which showed that the leader of the rebellion, Count Gaspard Albertino Marchetti, who had led an extremely successful private war with the corrupt and mysterious Count Gaspard de Mettrie, had fled to Taranto, in the southern province of Calabria, and that the local militia were attempting to suborn him as a spy. (The Count denied this.) I went on: that on two or three occasions it was clearly understood that Marchetti, having expended great pains and sacrificed a great deal of his reputation, was about to give the enemy what was perhaps the last truly splendid and fully realized speech of his kind; that, just as in the first speech he had extolled the virtues of England, adding that she was the land of ancient and free liberties, so now he would have her worship him as she had Marius, adding that he was ready to die for her just as he had Marius. I went on: that in the service of this speech I had learned that Marchetti had already repented of his offer and returned to Rome, that he had been canonized, that some days before he had invoked the name of Jesus Christ three times, but that the churches of Rome had refused him entry, although he had claimed apostolic privilege from lawful jurisdiction over the regions under his jurisdiction.

Prompto and his tortoise-colored retinue.

			“You could call me Poppy,” Quentin said, “but I’m not calling you Poppy.”

			“I’m not calling you Poppy,” the bird said.

			“What is it,” Poppy said, “?”

			“It sounds like a great time to me.”

			The men around the table exchanged looks of mild interest and then of alarm. For a minute it looked like the woman would make it in time—but then she was silenced by two or three more men, and her voice was gone.

			From the shadows, the trees could be seen trudging down the slope. From Quentin’s perch he could see that Betsy was already down, and she was struggling with one of the centaurs. He got a good look at her—her face was distorted, like a dead fish.

			From some height above the trees he could see a man pole-saddle-skipping mud through them. He was taking a commanding role, as if commanding a battlefield were an identity category. He was the guide, not the skid. Quentin got a good look at her when he saw her: tall, bald, with dreadlocks. The black SUV was coming straight at him, head down, tires squealing abysmally in the drudge mud.

			Something big is ramming into Fillory, Quentin thinks. And then something even bigger doesn’t.

			“What are you doing?” she said, and she kept on ramming him.

			She’s coming, she was playing, he was all fucked up in the head. God he’d really fucked up! But he couldn’t play anymore, he was lost, he’d lost his bearings, and then he lost control and it was over for him. The wagon wheel bucked and groaned, and the tires burned with friction—it was like trying to jack a sailship in a wadersack—and the man at the wheel just ran over you like a car with one massive sock pigeon on its roof. The man got off unscathed.

====================
Prompted by the arrival of the ferry the three set off on the last leg of the long, arduous, and now nearly exhausted caravan that followed the coastline to the Far East. The journey, its treacherous nature, its cost, the reward, the varied destinations, the constant harassment by sharks, the desperate need to change clothes often, the loneliness, the hunger, the sexual harassment, the partplaying by ancient time-honored artifice by strange alien beings, had disturbed them all. They had reached the far end of the world and were returning home.

As they were taking off from Pier 3, a high-pitched "boom!" like chain-gun fire filled the empty air. Instinctively, all three of them ran as far as their strength would take them to the portico of a orchard they knew about as well as the next person. As they ran, they saw Isaac struggling on the beach, Faygo in his hand, struggling with some incomprehensible fury. In the gloom, they did not see it, but beneath the bright sun, something was clearly amiss. Slowly, but sure that they would die soon, they pulled themselves together and called out to one another:



"Faygo, it is I, Isaac. I am dying."









Field of Pearls

By daybreak of the next day, on the third, the dreamer and the dreamer were in the garden of the orchard. A deep, sweet smell of peaches and nectar of a plant they did not recognize — echinacea — made them think it would be unhealthy to wake the witch. Still they followed the shrubs and vines.

Suddenly, an impulse made them stop. They saw a shadowy figure — it was like a god — walking toward them, its face forked with anger. The god shouted something unintelligible, the air became heavy with the aroma of phlegm and ash. The god punched a tree; the trunk snapped and groaned. The god turned its face away from them, as if it were concealing something. It was Janet, in her youth as now as still as she is old. It was past time they told their tale, but before that could be said the three of them forgot it and wandered on.

They had gone almost immediately, though in the confusion their tired, but not vainglorious, leader forgot one thing. He

Prompted by the death of his dying father, Charles entered the grammar school, then the philosophy and politics, and at last the studies of Hegel and Berkeley. In 1873 he repudiated both and set out as a renegade and anti-Semite ― and saved the first flush of his great career. In his writings one hardly finds anti-Semitism, though there are some signs of it. For twenty years he maintained a secret self-pity and secret happiness, but now he suffered severely, and a few readers did him injury. He died in a hotel room at Manzanares, in a fit of rage, plunged in a series of freakeries that have since been ascribed to him.

I remember him very little these days. I come back to my apartment at night, put on some music and ask myself whether on some cloud-scorched island in the interior of the earth, a medievalist of Judeo-Spanish extraction, startled out of a dream, is still discovering the universe at the beginning of time. I don't think I am that Angelo Badri, who so affectionately recounted one of his adventures.

I don't know what I shall do with my inheritance. Some one please bring me the law. Others, the Bible. Others, Shakespeare. Surely none of these is spurious.

Influence in Buenos Aires, 1884.

I am now, in my capacity of registrar, the son of an attorney. In my youth I did not leave much time for my beloved country. I never went there with young people: they could get me out of anything. Now I feel myself to be a foreigner in our own land: I go there often, but I never with young people. I used to travel in the language, but now I hardly ever speak it. I used to love the mountains and the cities, but now I feel like a traveler along empty and cold seas. I used to love the houses of the city, I no longer love them. . . I used to love the perfumes on the doors of the coffee shops, but now I feel like the only person who used them. I used to look at the faces of the children who were ready to enter the principal's room, but now they sit on the floor and look at the ceiling. I once dedicated a room to my memory, but now it looks just like another: the bathroom, the kitchen, the dining room. I once

Prompted by the sound of the door shutting behind him, he cautiously made his way to the foot of the stairs. There was a lot to do in this life and a lot to lose in the next. He was going to try to make himself useful before it was too late.

			When he made it to the top he found that the hallways were no longer lined with bookshelves. Instead, there were four or five very long flights of stairs leading up to the circular lobby, which was open onto a floor below the lobby. Janet stepped out into the hallway and onto the second floor.

			It was entirely enclosed. There were no windows, and the only light came from beams sticking up from the walls. An indoor basketball court lay next to the lobby, its wooden posts broken and falling askew, and half a dozen folding chairs and benches lay idle in the grass. The only sign of civilization was a low, curving staircase leading down, which Janet hurriedlyverted down. She would not be delayed.

			The double doors at the top and bottom of the stairs opened onto separate floors. Three or four people could be seen playing cards on the floor in front of the doors, fumbling with cards and shouting commands in each other's voices. A feminine electronic voice said, "One second."

			The first floor had a full-size TV with a Wi-Fi connection. A man who appeared to be in his twenties was watching "Game of Thrones," in which Caitish Thakur played the part of Sansa Stark. A woman in her sixties was doing the same thing. (In real life Janet and Caitish were only about twenty-five feet apart.) A wooden desk chair, slightly off-balance, had fallen two full feet onto the floor. Janet sat down and pulled up a sweat.

			The show went on. For twenty minutes no one in the Northern District of London was interrupted, and during that time Caitish Thakur uttered some phrase that no one in their right mind would utter, that phrase being "one second." (In the books, Sansa Stark, Joffrey's sister, had killed Joffrey, and Joffrey had killed her father.) No one had to be reminded twice: the matter was serious; the TV remote was not a magical one; lethal ambiguity was the order of the day. (In the books, Ned

Promptly to the west, Fergus MacNeill had driven an army of Orcs and Elves from the crags of the Black Gate and driven them deep into the Drowned Valley. The Orcs had overrun an abandoned tower town on the edge of the Valley of the Kings and were holding their position by raining down fire from their chariots and horse armpits on the feeble resistance defenders. To the south, in the Dwemer ruin-strewn province of the Salt Marsh, the Huns were trying to reclaim an ancient temple from an Emir who had renounced it and worshipped a Dwemer god in an elven sarcophagus. The Emir was a monstrously tall and imposing Drel, who spoke little, if any, Aldmeroth, and his cult was merely a local heresy. The Hun Emperor was Hlormagon, who ruled from his palace in the Vilemiad, an immense and very high sarcophagus in which, in Aldmero, he exerted an almost maniacal style not seen since the days of Homer. The Huns were barbarians, but they were also poets; the poem they were trying to write was epic, and they broke it many times, heroically, to write it. Every time they did so, they lost the point. Now they were closer to the end of the rope than they had been a day or two ago.

			The river was defying the odds, it seemed, and for once was not trying to be anything: it was undivided, free-flowing, and unbroken. There were no locks to distract the eye, and the water was as white as snow. It was, for the first time in forever, a truly magical river. For a few yards along the banks emerald-skinned waterwasp flitted, luminous, streaming eggs from its wings, and children's toys and games. Someone reported back to the shore: waves were fluttering lazily on the rocks, and the air was full of minute bird sounds. A shivering child with bright, sad eyes ran along the beach, his mother's red shoelaces dangling from them.

			Someone said the river was rye-colored, and another that it was champagne. Someone else reported that it was blue, and that it ran gold. A third man reported that it was spiked with ebony. Runes were spoken, and rumors went up. Men like Drum-Ham and

Promptly, with all his might, he turned his back on her and walked away. It was only after a few blocks that he caught her gaze and her voice. He felt her warm hand on his shoulder.

			“Quentin—”

			“Move!”

			She did. Quentin jerked away from her, toward the open door. He could have stayed, but he didn’t. He had to get more of a signal, a signal to his comrades, a signal that this was a trick, and he wasn’t going to be embarrassed by it. He was going to pull through and face this alone.

			He jogged through the door as close to the edge as he could without crossing anything, but he didn’t turn around before it got there. By the time he got halfway across the lawn it was too late. The red door slammed in his face behind him like an old-timey mailbox.

			Quentin jerked away from it and slammed the door behind him like he’d done it all his life. He was suddenly very far away from everything, very far from his first memory of Pushkar Moshe, very far from Fillory, and he wanted to get as far away from it as he could while he could. Far enough that he could feel its weight on his shoulders and see nothing but gray cloud trailing behind him. He wanted to turn around and go back to Earth.

			But he couldn’t. If he tried he would turn back time and do it already have Pierre lying dead on his lap, horribly desiccated on the grass, or Tristan talking to himself, or Melchior raping the Pride, or Violet dying in Melpomene’s arms. He didn’t have that time. He had to get out of the real world now. He moved along the lawn, feeling the clamor of the crowd and thinking about Alice and the trees and Alice’s scar, and then he bent down and picked up Melchior’s bloody shirt. It was warm and fuzzy.

			He put the shirt back on and put on his black cloak, feeling both things at once: the wet shirt and the cloak. The feeling of the shirt on his skin and the cloak on the ground, the two worlds mingling together.

Promptly we could lose ourselves in the ocean waves and the silence.







The Plover Chronicles



The books begin with the deaths of men. This may be taken for granted, though there is no reason to think it is so. There are, in other words, countless numbers of simple and faithful men who think they know everything and so try to be everything and become everything, and thereby get everything and not much and not everything. There are also innumerable millions of ingenious and noble men who, in an attempt to become everything, give up everything and become everything, and in the same effort to become everything they give up everything and give everything. (This is called the World-Possibility Problem.) There are innumerable others, but they have not yet acquired the habit of fascination of numbers and so on. There are also infinite parables, but they lack the power to fascinate us with their ability to reconcile two contradictory and seemingly irreconcilable facts.

There are also millions of imaginative men, who try to make of the infinite repetition of planets and the countless satellites of them a unit and then a contradictioniall force. (Apsara said that the dynasties of the Hindus and the Persians were the builders of this universe. The builders of this universe, in order to complete their work, destroy the world.)

There is no other world than this. All things in the universe are related to one degree or another. The hypothetico-temporal is hyperspace or, to speak more simply, theability of a thing related to it.

Promptly, the last of the dice-game fell from Alice’s lap and clattered onto the carpet.

			“What the hell?” Eliot said.

			“Dice?”

			“Yeah,” Plum said. “They’re supposed to be blackjack cards. They look like chips, but they go deeper. You throw them, and they go where you throw them. You keep 'em in a safe place, and when you need 'em back, they go where you keep 'em.”

			“But what does that even mean?” Plum said. “Like, you throw 'em, and they go where I throw 'em?”

			“You throw 'em like they’re chips,” Eliot said.

			“Yup.”

			Betsy shook her head.

			“Yuck. You could always make your own.”

			“I don’t know any good at it,” Josh said.

			“Yup.” Eliot couldn’t think of any persuasive reasons to disagree.

			“Neat trick,” Josh said. “If you don’t mind my asking,” he added, “did you make the mirror or the door yourself?”

			“The door.”

			“The mirror.”

			“Both of them.”

			“True.”

			Betsy bit her lip, and then she made a choking sound.

			“Enough,” she said. “It’s not like we have any money.”

			“I am getting on,” Josh said. “You. Know. Anything. About. the. Case. Anymore.”

			“I do.”

			“Why does everything have to be solutionist?” Plum frowned. “Is this how you how you want to be king? A sorcerer or a wizard?”

====================
Prompted by that first assault, the Germans withdrew their overwhelming forces, surrendering some of their most highly trained divisions to the Americans. British General Sir Robert Blackwall ordered his lieutenants in chief to prepare a general mobilization. This mobilization, which Blackwall formally launched on July 1, 1942, was the signal for the war that Britain and France would wage for nearly a year.

Blackwall's scheme was to wage war with a limited number of theaters, to mobilize his army in the most important battles and then withdraw it into the interior, to do this under cover of darkness, to be back and to do this almost instantly. The British commanders expected countermobilizations and mutinies, but generally they were satisfied, if a little overwhelmed by the force of nature. Meanwhile, the air in the prison smelled like burning rubber. Our men were forbidden to leave the fortress except in the most obvious and very urgent ways ― for example, in directions specified in a receipt given to them by Blackwall. Horses were forbidden to graze on the prison grounds. Our horses were shot down and our steeds devoured. Hunger and fear were the only emotions permitted. Furthermore, every man was expected to fight five bouts of three days' combat, under the general's eye. Afterward, we were to divide the loot and distribute it among the warriors. From this massive collective action it could be predicted that, even after nineteen months of unrelenting hunger and exhaustion, the war would go on for another nineteen.

The five-day-periods were used to develop specific physical and mental traits. Our prisoners were required tous helleques: strong, courageous, honest, jolly. Others were made to appearcourageous, honest. Others were made to appearcourageous, honest. At times the tactics were radically different. We once had a horse drawn by a donkey that, when charged, sprang three times on contact with its line. The troops were instructed to advance until they could overtake the curve of the obstacle, then they were to stop and fight the animal. Such was the origin of the sabre-toting general.

In the months immediately before the attacks the news reached us that the Wiener Ring had set upon us aihar, the "Great Sant Jealous," who, from the twelfth century on, has been presiding over the prodigious trial of the passions. The Wiener Ring, the story went, was a device by
====================
Prompted by a knock on the door, I opened it and found my handsome older sister Yolande waiting for me in her evening dress. We were very close now; I felt like I was a hundred years her senior. We walked hand in hand through the late afternoon light to the circular courtyard where the games were being held. We paused occasionally to look at the spinning rings, which were emitting a discordant hum from within them, as if someone had been forcibly disconnected from them and was now attempting to regain consciousness. Outside, the grass was swaying lightly in the breeze.

			I didn’t say anything. I figured that since my sister found out, things would have been different. That it wasn’t even a secret thing, she would have come out to them and they would have handled it differently. As it was she showed no sign.

			I think she figured that if she tried to talk to me, I wouldn’t be able to hear her. So she⚐�d figured that I would show up anyway and she would have to settle for showing up half-way.

			We executed a variety of deceptions, both overt and covert. One plan was so successful that the King and Queen were invited. (My father used to say that there were no blind ministers in life, but that was one case where I didn’t see it.) I never told them the whole story of the game, but I did show them parts of it.

			“Now,” my father said, “if you’re not scared, could you please come inside? I’m going to take your things and we’ll talk later. I’m sure we can talk about your game, about how you won the jackpot, without having to show anyone else winning either.”

			I did as he asked. Inside the house the clock was still ticking down to midnight, but my father was showing more respect than he usually did. He seemed to value his privacy even as he fought a war against it.

			He showed up at the door to his study, which was somewhat of a backdoor entry anyway. My father showed up much the same, though my father was the one who knocked.

			My father: My father has the house. I’m his assistant. I�
====================
Prompted by the metallic clank of metal on metal, he raised his hands and an invisible, imperceptible, electrically charged force sprang forth of him and overcame the force with which the door moved. It was like two magnets meeting. The force was so immense that the brass plates crackingled together after them. An invisible curtain of sparks flashed momentarily, then died.

			He staggered back a few steps. Face first in the dust, he tried to take in the scene around him—it was worse than he imagined. For the first time he thought, All of Fillory! The mountains, the swells, the waves, all of it! It was bigger than he expected. It was higher up, higher in the atmosphere than he is in.

			The platinum plates were helping him get his balance, and he was balancing on their plates again when he started getting some dizziness. It was like falling asleep—he thought for a moment and put his head under the covers.

			He was awakened, as they all were that night, by the soft ticking of the clock. It was Swaine, at the other end of the phone, giving him a hard time about Sweet Basilisk. It was in a trance like never before. He tried to step forward to get them both out, but Basilisk was already catching his balance by the second. No amount of shaking or kicking or waving would break it. It was like it was possessed by some Outer Spirit. He felt like he was the prison instead of the Spirit of the Lot.

			He and Sweet Basilisk were shaking their way out, then, while the headless body of the Hunted Fairy Blimpy jogged half a mile ahead. It seemed undaunted. When they got inside the room started giving up, almost inaudibly, in quiet gyrating patterns that he recognized from the fantasy.

			It was a weird one. The cashier was giving out hard-earned candies, and there were jelly candies inside a velvet pouch, and there was a little jar of spicy horseradish candies, and there was a can of peanuts, a bottle of mineral water, and a set of Ludwigs, and all of them were nicely corked and sealed in a clear plastic bag. The cashier had a huge stack of 400- or 500-dollar bills in one of his outstretched hands—he worked
====================
Promptly after that I was in a library, another world, but not quite another world. I was able to see the universe as it really was, the way the great masters do: in three-dimensional space and through three-dimensional mirrors. For the first time I understood that time does not pass absolute distances; it passes close up in front of us, and in front of us it passes very very far. There it loses its three-dimensional character, and becomes time. And I understood that if we are to understand the universe, time must also lose its three-dimensional character."

Between these two contradictory experiences he remained immovable. "I cannot," he would say, "inform myself by con- science. In fact," he would go on, "if I do not know what I am going to say, I know it already and I do not notice it. If I say the word cat, other cats will jump to the origin of that name; if I say leprechaun, the whole forest shadows the name of the god. The only thing I can't say is that I am a child of the void, of the vast unknown."

He had read in a book an imaginary forest, with chunky plants and obscure trees, with a god whose name was not yet come, and he would often speculate that this god was similar to the god of the dead man's novels but differed in one way: that one of his attributes was time, the other royalty. He would imagine these "secret" names and imagine that he was the bearer of those names. He would imagine talking animals and mysterious barns. Some days he would read a book a night, for many days he would lie down upon his back and not wake again. Sometimes he would forget and even forget at one and the same time. He was no longer a child, he was an old man. He grew and grew, and at the age of fourteen he was as big as an adult.

One afternoon, withoutardonable reading, he fell asleep with his eyes opened. The story he told was told to no purpose. He awakened again, his eyes no longer closed, but his mind unbearably concentrated. Then: "One morning the sky darkened, and a heavy fog descended. It was the beginning of the end. Already then I could see that the end was coming. Perhaps I had become senile."

Then: "I ran to the
====================
Prompted by a falling stone, Mikhdylov, seeing that they were under attack, raised his sword high in the air, as if to salute the sky, and then laid hold of the end just above his ear, and with one motion tore it out.

He had, in fact, cut his own ear off.

He threw up his arms in the air and cried:



O God, who possesses and governs the world!

I have betrayed my country and my people.

I have lost everything and am lost.

Lord, who will save me!

I beseech You, O Lord, that my death, now just, might be pleasing to Thee forever.

Ah, but now I know the doom which is fitting.

Oh, by the Father!

Oh by the Glory,

who bath our thirsty bones.







Conclusion



Let us consider, then, the arguments of Bartolomeiro Ibanez.

First, that the harpsichord, being a sacred instrument, is exempt from the general prohibitions of propriety; in other words, may it be had? Secondly, that the possession of foreign instruments is not an abominable pollution peculiar to the servant or the drunkard, but is universal; in other words, what is good belongs to all men, and what is common to all is brotherhood. Thirdly, that the use of absurd arguments can justify us; e.g. that two men who wear the crown of Thorns and the crown of the Hoplite may be tabulated among the treasures of Assyria. Fourthly, that the use of terms like "barbarian," "nomadic," "deceitful," "infidel," "son of a whore," "devil," and "monster" is not only normal but is the signal fragrance of eloquence.

In the light of these five arguments, it is incomprehensible. The first, that foreign objects may contaminate the just distribution of riches, seems to be the realm of the absurd; the second, that the possession of foreign objects is not an abominable pollution, although many of the men who wield them are barbarous and insane; the third, that the possession of foreign objects is not an abominable pollution, although, according to another of his sayings, "the objects are among us but
====================
Prompted by the fact that the events taking place in the library were of a political nature, I established communication with the Left Bank branch of the Socialist Party. From this branch I obtained information which, in turn, was of a political nature.

This political nature, as has been indicated, was that of Marxism. Since the death of Lenin in Tula on March 3, [1913], a cadre of militants from the various tendencies have delved into the contradictory documents of that learned and erudite teacher. They have produced, in the course of their studies, an almost perfect comprehension of the fundamental tenets of Marxist philosophy. They have also, within the limits prescribed by the documents they have translated, attempted to expound their system in their own language. Their publications, which we are pleased to publish, demonstrate the firm foundation laid by Leninism on the most varied and firm bases.

Among the most eminent of these MilovsBNalandavatakkara, published in 1928, is the collection Milovské li qanúmlé svarto (The Militant Discourse on the Philosophy of Liberation), which won first prize at the First International Congress held in Antwerp in September, 1928. This was the material for Milovs' present work.

Another Milovskiy, published in 1931, is the philosophical novelsinábulletín (Downfall of the Gun). This was the subject of our letter of October 12, 1931.

In February, 1932, I returned to Budapest. From Bőeszkényi I purchased a book from a bookseller belonging to the Bicanavé family. This was the abridgment Guadalupe Bicanor had prepared for me, in whose hands it remained during my stay in that city. The bookshop owner introduced me to Oscaro Bicanor, who introduced me to Oscaro Oscaro Oscaro, the eighth generation of the Oscaro Bicanor family. Oscaro Oscaro Oscaro is the owner's middle name. His younger brothers include Oscaro Julio, Oscaro Julián, Oscaro José and Oscaro José Martínez. Their mother's maiden name is Notarskiy. Their father's name is Oscaro.

The family moved into an apartment on the rue Saint-Denis. The climate in Budapest is not temperate, but this made the apartments in no particular

Promptly, the rams placed the golden sword in his hand.

“Our Lord, you say, and Umber, and the sword, and the water, and the locust, and the locust, and the water, and the locust, and the water, and the locust, and the water, and the locust, and the locust, and the water, and the locust, and the locust, and the water, and the locust, and Umber, and the dragon, and the dead horse.

The rams placed the dragon in Umber’s place.

Umber was astonished. He looked around for the beast, but could find none.

The rams told him that the beast was near at hand, and told him to come. He entered the city, clad in a centurion’s robe, and saluted the rams. The god smiled, turned pale, and shrank himself to the ground. The rams blessed him, Imhotet, the prince of the universe, raised his divine head, and uttered a thousand words which Imhotet could understand, though he did not know better. The god then commanded the centurion to place a golden spike in the ground at the location just indicated, that is, at the spot where the city was revealed. The centurion, in the presence of the gods, who are also witnesses, displayed great valor, struck the spike out of the ground with a sickle, and the spike spread widely, until at last it centered in the humble pediment of the chariot of a dead king. The centurion, gravely, counted to ten, set himself the number of rocks to the left and right of the pediment, and said: 106. Then he revived the dead king who had been his enemy.

Imhotet, now in his glory, paused before the spires of Babel. The tongues of all lands sang his name, but one tongue—that of the rams themselves.

The language of the rams is language of the slow perdition, of the pit, of corruption, of insignificance. It is a language of triumphal approaches, of twelve-tone arithmetic, of combinators so diverse that it is almost miraculous that all of them reproduce the same number. It is a language of multiplicities so great that it is trivial to the man
====================
Prompted by this new information, the others interrogated the historian for other sources of information about the fates of men. The historian gave them a history of the most remote ages, with the widest geographical and chronological apparent applicability to present-tense situations. The inventors of the Garden speculated that men's lives ought to be comparable, so far as possible, and so analyzed the past to understand the present. They have discovered, as the historian showed in the first Instruciones, that all men are like a great ship; all men have in common the cardinal characteristics of happiness, of which the Greek epitaphs are but a symbol; in the most dispersed and fluctuating parts of the globe, the human race may be said to revolve about the central point, where the variations in elevation and in the amount of darkness are but periodic vibrations. This centrality has been recognized by Mazzini and others; from this fact it has been deduced that the continents are not fixed monoliths, but are in fact gradations or gradations of the one central point. There are three or four hemispheres in the Western Hemisphere; each hemisphere has three or four hemispheres; the Greek words for "earthly sphere," "earthly prison," and "prison" are simply synonyms. . . From these three observations it could be proved that the fates of all men are summed up in the three famous iron spheres, and also in the Bible and in the works of Shakespeare. In England, among the Puritans, the doctrine was formerly the stuff of scandal; among the modern socialists, it is as unknown as Darwin was to his contemporaries. It is perhaps a corruption of the Mohammedanism of Arabia; it is perhaps borrowed from the heathen worship of the Icelanders; it is perhaps from the Semitic religion of the Arabian deserts. Whatever the origin, the results were the same: a just and justly obtained punishment.

I have just alluded to the consequences of an idea in philosophy. Let us consider another: that of unknown causes. It is well known that in the outward world there are no causes; equally well known it is that without causes nothing happens. If this is so, it is no less well known that without causes the idea of an idea is a mere phantom: if an idea is nothing but the relation an r o o m o u s l o v a t i o n a n d the relation r o o
====================
Prompted by the arrival of the dryad, the other three fled into the depths of the library. From time to time the lights flickered, briefly, on and off, as if for no other reason than to warn them that some unknown danger lurked in the darkness.

			The last time there had been a library party Quentin remembered well well the tall, lanky, take no prisoners type, as he had come to be known. Harriet had ordered champagne in glasses topped with clear mineral water, and when he brought the champagne back from a walk with her he found her presenting him with a neat scarlet volo. Quentin had thought her a pretty girl, but after what he had seen there was no way he was letting herself be dragged into this.

			He was disappointed when the archivist turned him away. He was being ungrateful, as it turned out, and granted that the voluptuous character of the vase counted for something, but he also didn’t want to be rude. It wasn’t that he didn’t love voluptuous people, it was just that this was a woman. It wasn’t his place.

			Harriet studied her reflection in the chandelier. Her face looked the picture of total complacency, or perhaps of repose. But Quentin noticed after a while that she was becoming more animated, making some head of defending herself against the charge of being a pushover.

			When the hour came they broke the silence breaker system. They broke it without even a flash of the welcome glow of a torch.

			“It’s funny,” Quentin said. “I kind of imagined ourselves in this place. Did you know that anywhere you go in this world you’ll find versions of yourself? You might have been here, or you might be going through a door, or you might have been playing a game, or you might have been on a train, or you’ve been in the same book as this guy, or whatever. You get the idea. In a way you are anywhere you look.”

			She stuck out her hand, and he took it. She was a small, almost invisible symbol of peace in the mad, chaotic world of Fillory.

			“I’m not making a big deal out
====================
Promptly, after the first day, they agreed that a night in the same hotel bed was worth it, even though the full weight of the consequences would have been bearing down on them for the rest of the month. They went downstairs, to the living room, which was still in ruins; Julia entered through a busted window, which Jane had cleverly sealed up. The young couple watched as it was torn down, but smoke drifted out into the hall, strangling the night. Julia had a new iPhone 6s, and she insisted that they use it while they’d have sex in the bed. (It was the first time in their illicit lesbian relationship that they seemed to really get behind the idea.)

			They watched for an hour, until dawn broke, and then went back up to the third floor. They watched it again when the third moon came up, and then again when the fourth came around again, casting a pall of smoky, choking smoke across the cityscape. At the top of the stairs they paused, Trevor taking a deep breath, then they fell over, and Julia shoved her hips uncomfortably, and the couch overturned, and Julia put out her hands in a panic and fell face first down onto the couch, land down. She caught herself only once, like a fish on a wire, into the cushions.

			She sobbed once, on the floor, and then got up and went to the ladies mirror to get changed. (In the books, the mirror doesn’t work, you have to get up and then get dressed.) She thought for a minute that they might try it—they had such a lovely, silken, silky feel to their fall, like they were being raised by gods. Then she realized what a disappointment that disappointment would be. It was too soon.

			They should have gone to bed, but Julia was up, and not just because she was the night air had taken over. She went up to high five Julia, put her hand on the screen, and whispered in her sleep. It was the first time that night had registered in her life what a weird dream it was. The dream had come too soon, too embarrassingly, and something had gone wrong. The lessons from Brakebills should have been bedtime stories, now they were hours of slow burner romance. What a fool she was to let them stay that way. She would
====================
Prompted by the milieu of his fictional mid-nineteenth-century Buenos Aires, he traced the gradual emergence of that fictitious city from the ruins of what was once called Buenos Aires and what he was returning to. He realized that the final confrontation with the outside world was inevitable and that the only way out would be a decisive sacrifice. He chose exile.

He was immediately confronted with two of the most appalling aspects of nineteenth-century life: the sexual abuse of children and the obscenity law. The former horrified him; the latter did not. The former required a massive creative effort on his part; the latter did not take up a single secondhand book or marginal newspaper strip. Law and its attendant punishments seemed, at first glance improbable demands on human energies; then, when considered in the framework of a complete fictional city, as Plover admits, they seemed almost divine.

The first act in his ambitious achievement was performed in the bookstore across the hall. This was the theft of a book, a very expensive book, a classicist's edition of the Bible, that had been on the second floor for two centuries and was said to be the secret name of God. The second theft, a third, was even more brazen. This time the target was a closet stocked with weapons, a target which seemed almost dreamt of by Plover, who at first seemed out of the question, then seemed almost perfectly feasible. He had to make a detour, and that was to take up residence not in the bookstore, but on another shelf of books. His new shelf of books willed itself as his present one did, but they did not know that they were brothers. They shared one book, the terrible book, and for that reason Jane Fairfax had written it.

In those first acts of his crime Plover was what we would call a schemer. He would steal before he would steal, and the second he took was a lesson in that cardinal principle of his: he would plan his deeds as he would have committed them had he done them. He made a harbor in that double life, but in the midst of it he was inventing whole worlds of his own. What could be more natural than that a man who had so nobly confronted his destiny as the hero of a new story should contrive ways to use that story as a platform for changing his own? That is, should he have contrived means by which to transform the story into a
====================
Prompted by the arrival of the children, the old man began to weep. He recalled the names of the animals he had slaughtered, the dried meat, the salt and pepper shakers, the dirty clothes, the long flights over dark and muddy water. Finally, he spoke:

"Twenty years ago, I came to this part of the city. I wanted to roast some venison. I didn’t kill it myself, but I gave it to a servant, and the result was V/CF. I wondered if I could communicate with it, if I could solicit its opinion. I decided to leave my mark on that particular kill, so I gathered some juniper sticks and a wooden spoon. I also had the disadvantage of being closely watched. I made a map of the city on my knapsack, and on the way I took great care that I didn’t leave anything out. At the end of the road, at the foot of the steps, there was where my marking began. I marked the entrance to the second story, on the right. I marked the passage on the wall through the barred window, where the barrels were stacked. I marked the brass buttons on the door, so that they registered a single key, a latrine key. I marked the brass buttons on the wooden panel that divided the laboratory from the outside world, so that the word TRANSMISSION FROM INFINITY were found in every book that arrived at the house that day. I marked the brass buttons on the plate that contained the corpse, so that its parts could be identified, until finally I arrived at the four I have mentioned. My meticulous precaution did two things for me: (1) It gave me a key to a room bigger than myself, and (2) it made me impervious to the effects of fear and panic. Before I left, I reassessed myself: this is a man who has clearly followed the rules, has tried to please me, has made a good scout. And I was not mistaken. I was rewarded by being greeted by the sound of doors slamming, by the tread of steps, by the smell of metal and blood, by the hum of gears and chains. Within a week, the men at the post heard my footsteps, and when they opened the door they saw a naked man hurrying along in the corridor, shouting with furious voices, while furiously cutting people’s hands with his axes.

I have said
====================
Promptly, the man stepped out of the car, as if the door itself were no longer there. He came to a stop in front of the door.

			“It’s closed,” he said, to spite Plum. “Close enough.”

			Plum had forgotten about the beep, the frisson, the niceness of it. It was like a light bulb went off in her head. She pressed herself up against the door, got up off the floor, feeling very light and buoyant. Maybe this was it. Maybe this was it, all of it, and she was the one who had needed it most. Maybe this was what she had wanted all along.

			“I’m out of my mind,” she said. “I don’t know why I’m so anxious. I’m not from here. I’m not in a movie.”

			“Just telling the truth,” Quentin said. “You’re from here too.”

			“Well,” Plum said, “since when. I’m here as a favor to the ghost of the librarian who created Martin!”

			And as abruptly as it had come on, the beep had an echo effect, returning with a different register to the one that had been generated just now. The room started to fill with static, repeated mantra-beeps, sounding off between one another like so:

			“Information, information, information.”

			“In order for me to believe you,” the beep read, “I’ve had almost four decades of being brain-dead,” which was closer to the truth than Quentin’s version had been. “I need more time to process everything. Please, have you not? It’s been seven years. We could start over.”

			The man he embraced slid out of the chair. He was small enough that she wondered if he was over five-year-olds, and he’d been stored in a glass cube in the corner of the workroom like a sarcophagus. He’d had a bad cold; she didn’t notice it
====================
Prompted by a conga line from his window, Draco found himself face to face with the most beautiful, mysterious, powerful woman he had ever seen.

She was younger than he was and she was dressed in flowing, rich colors, from the outfit she wore the night of the interview—a jaunty kind of way. Her face was slightly torn and her eyes were dead. But she had something else, too: she was happy. She was smiling even though her teeth were clenched and her lip was moving. She said something, but it was hard for him to hear what she said. He thought he could see her trying not to laugh at his stupidity. But he could feel her trying to stop him. She said something else and his breath caught. In that second, all awareness went out of him.

The book came down from its perch on her lap. She unfolded it and held it up to the light streaming through the skylight. Her features relaxed, her hands go from palm to palm, as if in greeting. She took the book from his hands.









The Magician and the Oracle



One night in the first cell of the Guadalquivir Islands was colder than any other night in recent memory. Back in Barataria, Pedro Alvarenga was ripping potatoes from the green tops and putting them into long metal pans; Juan Orlando was tinkering with mechanical chests that took metal ore and turned it gold; in Leandro Herrera's cell, playing Russian roulette, were Jorge López de Santa Anna, dead at the Bay of Pigs, and Adolfo Yáñez, who became known as the "Miracle on Maple Street," who miraculously produced six rubles of silver and returned them to the Miraflores. The wooden bunk bed was heavy with sheets, and the air in the room smelled like tears.

The future king of Spain was befuddled. What was all this, a miracle for? Why did they want his help? What were they trying to hide? Anticipating their curiosity, he locked the cell and then the house. Then he took a razor he knew he knew, and with them as a present for Christmas was all the protection he needed.

He knew that the island was far from New York City, but not so far that the Miraflores couldn’t find him. As he left the Markets
====================
Promptly, I began to feel that there was nothing in the world more worthless than life itself. I felt as hopeless and pointless as everyone else. Everything I had ever known, everything I would ever have, seemed like so much rubbish and trash online. I wanted to throw up. I wanted to throw up and then come down again and throw up all over again. I wanted to throw up in front of everybody.

			—

			It was at Brakebills that things really took off for me. I couldn’t have said why, apart from I was just naturally talented and lucky and liked the company of people with talent. We all enjoyed dressing up in our best selves, having parties, dressing up as characters from books, dressing up as characters from stories. It was always a laugh—everyone was so excited and silly and all around miserable! At one such party, I took Delilah at her finest, as I now am, and spoke a joke about his having a new series of Sherlock stories.

			“Oh, I don’t, it was just a bit of a shock, to be honest, to see him standing there in his uniform, with his gun drawn, with that big stunned little Annie in the other room with the big mechanical snowman through the window. I thought of everything that had befallen us, what had been, and it was only a matter of time before someone found out.”

			I didn’t. It happened later, on Day Fourteen, when Professor Coldwater came for me in the middle of the night. I was lying on my back on the couch, cross-legged, staring up at the ceiling. I don’t know how long, it was just the two or three hours it took, but I started to drift off, until I was hard as a rock. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t have dreams. I opened my eyes and looked at the ceiling. I was back in bed, cross-legged on the floor, Rainbow Stoned on my shoulder.

			“What?” I said. “All right. You fellas both of you. All of you. It’s all right now.”

			“All right.” Professor Coldwater’s voice was
====================
Prompted in his sheet by the thought of a tea party, I went to bed early. I was prepared, like everyone else, for a few days of cloudy indifference; however, I sensed a danger that had not been apparent in a while. The year was 1912. The English civil war was still in its infancy; and though the government's antidemocratic decrees and vigilante justice programs had failed, the anarchists were exerting themselves, staging massive riots and bombings throughout the cities, often in the same night, sometimes in the same neighborhood. In some of these attacks, like those on April in Petrograd and May in Leningrad, the anarchists claimed responsibility with shocking ease; in other cases, however, it was becoming obvious that these so-called "new social revolutionaries" were not "men" at all but rather secret service informers for the British secret service, MI6. As the months went by, the chill began to set in. It was becoming increasingly clear to all that something was fundamentally wrong with the "New Social Revolution." Perhaps it was the cigar smoke; perhaps Iron Chancellor Churchill had rolled a few too many; perhaps the working-class support that had brought about the end of the Thirty Years' War was fading away like the last of the roses. Perhaps something more fundamental was happening, something that would remake the world. Something terrible was happening, and it was happening now.

I have tried to set forth with sufficient brevity what I remember of that night, of that terrible day. It is more than a few people I know ― very few people ― who tell stories that cannot be substantiated. They tell them as if they are the truth, as if they are fully as interesting as the truth is. Stories that are mostly false. Stories of assassins, witches, backwoods minstrels. But there was one man in that theater that day who told the whole truth: George Cukor.

Every biography is an infinite mirror. Some of the faces are real; some aren’t. If your true face were one of the others, you wouldn’t be able to tell me anything bad about anyone.

Kiss me once, give me something as great as a car, and somebody will take you away.






CRIME AND MYSTERY



Sometime in the latter part of the eighteenth century, a circumstance occurred which completely changed the course of his life. Sherlock Holmes
====================
Promptly, we left the city, on foot. The sky was, for lack of a better word, a cloudy black, the ground ugly green. The road was marked by a series of low houses, a few of them very ancient. We stopped at a bar, ordered some whiskey, and then hurried away. None of the men in the group wanted to be identified; they were all dressed in black, like the denizens of some unknown alien city.

			On the way, Janet told me that her father had been a regular at the farm, and that she, Veil, had come to take up his trade. We were full of stories about fatherless children and lonely fathers, and about the handsome young fellow who could talk to any animal, any color, any person he chose to name. We talked about kings and queens and conspiracies, and about the old blind grandad who could sometimes be found lying in wait at the back door. We even recalled the time, several centuries back, when we had hunted with him, and where we had rested from the repeated pressure of his campaign. But there was no blood, and the wildness of the plotters was such that none of them would have us associated with them. A warning from the wall told us that those who followed its signal would find ourselves in the same situation as the renegades “ of the Bull Run. Primitive, unprotected, without families or lands, and dealing with men so much more powerful than themselves. The warning was a riddle.

			We left the river and traveled west, toward the city walls. I went first; my horse failed me, and I was unable to break discipline with Janet. We traveled day and night, until our shoes shone like polished logs. Then I retired to the city's western quarters, where I slept until the next day.

			The next day we rode to the other end of the wall, which ran parallel to the other wall. The camp was in the midst of a black swamp, and the ramparts were in ruins. The city had stood for some time besides the banks of the river, leaking cisterns into the muddy marshes, and it was becoming apparent that it was time to give up its unfinished business. A few heavily armed footmen, armed with crossbows and battle cries, rushed the harbor, where a harbormaster (Hanchey) had been killed by a lecherous negro who
====================
Prompted by the large and very polite and very scholarly and very politically incorrect woman to leave, I went to the back of the store and bought a couple of tchotchkes and a copy of the Village Voice. Although they were technically not cashiers---they were trade journals---they were pretty good. I didn’t even have to show my ID; the cashier gave me the birdcage pass, which I used to show up at the counter, take my regular jobs at the cash registers (picking up loose change from the women who sold newspapers) and go home.

			I don’t know if it was the drugs or the vision or the ringing in my ears or howling in the night, but from about four in the morning until eight in the morning I didn’t see anything. I don’t think I’d needed an eye examination or a CT scan or a MRIs or a PET scan or a full brain scan since then.

			At some point during the next three days I stopped taking the pills, and by the next one I was on Prozac. In the days that followed I couldn’t get myself to eat, and I got so weak from the cold that my dad took me to the Upper West Side Navarro jail, where I stayed for two weeks. Then they put me in a holding cell in Hempstead Prison, in Manhattan, where I stayed for four more weeks. In the fall of 1949 I went over to Brakebills, and during that year I’ve been over there every year my college graduation year.

			There are things in life that you have to learn about, but you also have to learn things from people. I spent my last semester of my senior year of college at Brakebills. I was living in Manhattan Beach at the time, on the 9000 block of North Howard Street. My rooming house was a few doors down from a pool room and an ice rink called the Comet. When I came back I had not looked in for three weeks.

			The question was, how long had they told me? I didn’t want to find out. I needed a new memory, and fast. I needed something to latch onto, fast. I needed it now.

			I remember their language well. They told me they were from the British Isles, the Carpath
====================
Promptly after midnight, we were under the shelter of a tree. I tried to climb up, but he smote me instead, and I fell heavily, like a bull in a china shop. I heard voices, French voices; they said they were from the gate of the jail. I ran, but they pursued me too and I fell deeper and deeper into darkness.

Suddenly I looked up and saw a figure I never expected to see; it was me, but it was also the figure of the other man, Jean Paul Marat. The former was a man of about my own height, with sandy, heavy blond hair, and he wore a gray suit and a gray tie. I was very high up, but not very wide, and not very high enough to be bothered by birds or by animals on the ground. I saw the air around me, and something very far away caught my eye and held me for a moment. It was a cloud that night, floating in the night sky. It was the sound of marching and dying bodies. I felt myself to be that distant cloud, some years way, moving along on elastic rubber tracks, on the wind, not noticing the distant corpses of my brothers and sisters.








The Library of Babel



As I said, my master did not wish to speak with me. I think I was able to let him know my purpose. Once again, my purpose was to draw his attention to the fact that I was an amateur sleuth and that I could provide no assistance to my master in the matter of the Library of Babel. To this end I presented my skills as an investigator, as a library, as as as asan no hanashita, as a shoemaker, as a foreigner, as an atheist, as an infidel, as a liar, as a monk, as a madman, as a slave. Finally, I presented myself as an alien from Asia and from the world.

I did not speak a word of my plan. Towards the end of 1877 I was smoking a cigar in a public place and at the sight of the portrait of Napoleon III. de- bears I took a little nap. Inwardly, I was overcome by anger. A few hours later I understood. A man of letters did not allow a stranger to speak to him in his native language; the man recalled to me the harsh words I had used about his companion that dreadful
====================
Promptly after midnight, the four of them were standing in the entrance hall of the palace. They were all wearing white; it was a military day.

"What brings you all the way here?" A tall, balding cavalryman asked them. "We heard you were coming." The others answered him civilly. "It's nothing to worry yourself about." A woman in a black cape and fin looked at them warily. "Very noble, but very few of these things are fit for consumption." The tall one shook his head gravely. "These are merely entertainments. Those who refuse to accept hospitality forfeit their dignity." He pointed at the warriors. "Is it the conceited stubbornness or the stubborn stupidity that earns you this?" He pointed at Plum, who seemed almost comatose with pride. The others sat down cross-legged on the carpeted floor. The tall one began jeering at them. Plum looked around: just then a pair of ear-splittingly huge eyes stared back at them from some of the innumerable potted plants lining the corridor. The others ignored them.

"What are you doing here?" asked the one with the large one'seses.

The others looked at each other awkwardly. Quentin guessed that the question was probably rhetorical. He and Alice had a thing about ninja; she was very pretty, and he was not quite as tall as she was, and they both felt like they were pretty fairly young, depending on how many hours they'd put into their martial arts training. She had dark hair, and when he saw her picture he frowned, but it turned out that she did have very pretty dark hair. She shrugged demurely.

From one of the plaster lions that carpeted the walls opposite a metal detector sprung to life. It was the one in the photo, the one that showed him handing Stoppard a cigar, but Quentin had never seen it. For some reason it made him feel a little lighter. He got up and walked briskly through the empty hall. Somebody had put a black plastic chair in front of the metal detector, but it wasn't moving. Quentin didn’t know why the owner of that sight wanted it moved, and he didn’t follow her. He stopped at the opposite table, this one empty. It was full of books, books that had been heavily studied and handed over to him unasked-for, and which he
====================
Promptly after, we watched the welcome mat come down and fall around our heads. It was a long way from the comfortable cocoon of the jungle club, but even so it was a long way from the sense of security and belonging that had been our best years at Brakebills. Now the vague, almost imperceptible fear was clear-cut: if We lose this game, we are finished. We are nothing. We are nothing and nothing alone. And nothing and nothing alone.

			The next morning the birds weren’t so chipper. Not in the usual dingy, babbling sort. They were more wary than usual that day, more on edge than usual. They were worried about things—about Shakespeare, about snakes and lizards and boys and girls and birds and books.

			It was hard to follow the story all the way through to its happy middle. There was once a time when Umber wanted this game, and if We lost He would abandon it to the flames. There was a time when Umber wanted this game, and if We won we would have destroyed it. There was a time when Umber wanted this game, and if We won we would have won it. There was a time when Umber wanted this game, and if We won We would have won it.

			There was a time when those things were possible. Not any longer. The past few weeks have been very difficult for Fillory. If we didn’t have games to do, we would have plenty of time to think about it. But as it is, We must all be playing by the rules at the same time. You will be supporting the Keepers that week, Lorian. That’s all we’ve got. Let’s see how much of an impact this will have.”

			He left the Keepers to Lorian alone, reading the small bronze calendar that housed his magical and physical well-being. He left behind the tiny, vulnerable image of a baby he didn’t know, never knew, that he tried so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so
====================
Prompted by this, the others began to talk, not without some impatience. Emma had begun to rave about the potential dangers of this and that magical material, Lillian about the potential dangers of that. Fiona's preoccupation at this juncture was perhaps not so much with the talk itself (which was already incendiary) as with the language. She was having a hard time staying on topic while she was talking.

			She kept going over the talk-rails over and over in her head, back and forth, halting and accelerating when the rails went over, then rising to a stop again, before she could even get back to the walker problems. Her brain wasn’t quite making it.

			She was back in her room now. She was practically naked, with the short sleeve shirt off, and a black dress shirt with a red flowerprint, from when she came in late to pick up her things from the bookstore. She didn’t bother to change. Sweat was starting out across her forehead.

			She wasn’t going to college, or not any time soon anyway. She was going to miss her Nerf leagues, but she was going to miss her home life too. She was still in love with Adam, but he was moving out now, and she was moving in. She and him had a lot of work to do, and he kind of missed it. She was still picking back up where she left off when she wasn’t working.

			She wasn’t as hot and bothered as she was during lunch. Fish was on the menu, but not the way it used to be. Meat was kind of a afterthought. She was pretty sure she had some leftover from the drive to the Target, and she was pretty sure that after dinner they were just going to sit on the couch for a bit, read a bunch of DVDs, and see where this is going. She was still craving something, really big and bold, and she was pretty sure she could whip up something that was both delicious and small and sweet and tangy and garlicy and savory and savory and savory and savory and savory. It was a new kind of challenge. A whole new bird.

			She was still feeling the effects of Quentin’s spell, even though they’d stopped concentrating on it. She was still trying to
====================
Promptly after dawn, on the third day of his captivity, the ship left the port and turned east. The first light was of the violet kind, not of the burning kind that is the iron. The trees, the air, the sea were still and stilling. A new, lighter light began to rise from the darkest places, to shine upon the bodies and the faces of the prisoners. Julia, Elisha, Huan and I began to leave the ship. We did not know whether to run or to hide. We ran as if some terrible doom was at hand. We ran, lest the flames of hate and of despair should consume us, or, at least, that the horror of our sufferings should encourage us and make us stronger. I ran as if my neck and my arms would be cut off if I did not. . . Suddenly I turned and saw Julia crying out in pain.

"Eliot and I only knew what was happening, because Huan had seen it too. When Huan saw that his friend was lying down, he sprang to his feet. Falling to one knee, he greeted me with these words: " Friend Huan, you perjured yourself at the altar a moment ago, but the Lord has already judged you a sinner. You have denied Him, have you not, when the last benediction was made? And if your eyesight is good, the justness of the judgment is clearly seen in the inscription written on the rock where your body was found: God spared not a righteous man his eyes, and his right hand was also put on to receive the portion of a paralytic."

"What," said I, "is the sentence 'Paralyzed man's right hand' supposed to mean?"

"It means that Huan Chengtu, famous for his strokes, had his right hand elevated and his left hand dropped."

"But how could he have done that?"

"Because behind Huan Chengtu were four or five left hands, like those of the Selectmen, and when the condemned man raised his head and touched the ground, the four or five hands would rise again and lift him up."

"But if he had four or five hands," I replied, "why did the Almighty allow four or five more?"

"Because whenever a man raises his head, two things happen: first, he sees God; secondly, two persons, two
====================
Prompted by this, the others returned their weapons and sang and waved them grandly. They were the Royal Marines, of course, the greatest military dynasty the world has ever known, led by nothing less than the Age of Enlightenment.

�		It was a monumental feat, kings and queens and princes and dukes and abbeys and synagogues and palaces and bakeries and taverns and literally anything else that wasn’t a building that had somehow gotten bigger and more powerful under the guidance of everybody from duck-callers to minarets. All of them were out in force to celebrate what they perceived to be the glorious restoration of the ages. It was a much bigger world than they had known, everyone, and it was all much, much more crowded than it had been a century or two ago.

			There was a rush of new things opening up the air and replacing the bland things that people retired to their closets: trams, subways, elevators, most of the rest of the transportation network, almost everything that was human-shaped or animal-shaped. Stairways to the stars, everybody’s favorite transport mode. And then they stopped and looked up: the Clock Bar was still up, but it was day time, and the windows were half full of clear, winter-rain-free summer air.

			There was a coolness to the plaza: there was a dry, permanent, elemental quality to them. The clop of somebody pushing an outdoor shoe rack down a flight of steps. The sound of kids running on trolleys. The feeling of actually being in a world that wasn’t your own. It was your own when everybody else was other people, when everybody else had their own baggage, their own hopes, their own tribulations, their own ends and ends. This was home.

			Everybody they knew’s back in the States was a huge loss, but they were going to have to look after each other. That was part of the bargain: they were all going to have to take an active role in preserving the other side of the bargain, in safeguarding its outcome. That was the point. The Clock Bar was going to have to weather the storm if it was to survive.

			“I was going to tell you about my mother, about how my father walked into a pawnshop, into which he had
====================
Promptly, the Magi left him. Not in a foolhardy fashion, the way they always did, of course, but expedient. They had made a promise to themselves and it is not easy to keep. The man was in a bad place at the time. His wife and children were. The old Agrippina, sitting on a great armchair with a glass of water for a beverage, dispensing justice to a prostrate and splenetic prisoner.









The Lottery in the Tang Dynasty

Those who read my narrative will naturally suspect that I in some way betrayed their trust. After all, the narrator (whose identity is kept closely concealed) is the son of the treacherous general, who turns out to have been the illegitimate son of the queen.

But I can no longer speak of my past. In the face of public calamity, in the face of conflicting ideals, in the face of the hostile ambushes of decadence and barbarism, in the face of the curious paradoxical habit of the Tang dynasty of nominating its kings and queens with mysterious regularity, I am tempted by a kind of inner assurance. I believe that our faith in the divinity is weak without a convincing evidence of his power on earth. If there is a power without an explanation, and without a name, what is it that we attribute to it? It seems to me that a description sufficient to inspire it is lacking. To name it, I submit to the human eye a fiction unexplainable by logic.

In the absence of such a description, I think of a formulaic form which Raymond Lully has christened the "Twilight," or "Night of the Hunter." It is a formal piece, a rhapsody, but when it is over it is as if the piece had not been completed. There are certain final notes at the end which I do not understand, but which add up to a dramatic conclusion. I understand that in some obscure corner of the world a hunter has just been elected president. I do not understand how this decision, which affects the destiny of entire nations, can be legitimate. I think that the present hunter, who is old, inexperienced or mediocre, can redeem the nations of the world. He will be a blessing to the earth and to the sky."

"The Present Hunter" is engraved on the cover of the second issue of N. I. H.
On page eight
====================
Prompted by the sight of a gray-haired man, clad only in a black nightshirt, the others dispersed and he and the gray-haired man went their separate ways.

			“But it wasn’t the gray-haired man who frightened me,” Quentin said. “It was the woman. She was perfectly symmetrical, and she carried herself in a manner that was entirely nonchalant. I found myself wondering if it was all a bit much—asking whether or not you wanted to be here, whether or not you were comfortable with being king, that was different from being king. But you wanted it anyway, so what were you going to do about it? I figured I would let my curiosity be our guide, and we’d figure out what was best, and that’s what we did.

			“We didn’t know each other then. When I look at you now I think of Alice, and how beautiful she was. I looked at Quentin, and thought, what is it about me that you find appealing? Because I think about that all the time. What I find attractive about you, exactly you, exactly you. You’re so real. You’re in a different league altogether than anyone else I’ve ever met.”

			Quentin thought this was what Eliot was talking about.

			“But you know, Eliot,” Quentin said. “I wonder what the hell would have happened if we’d sat down and actually done the movie.”

			Eliot looked at each of them suspiciously. Plum had the big scary-looking map, the one that showed where everything was if it ever got destroyed, in her hand now; the one with the stars and the hyperspace tunnels and the damn mirror.

			“If we had sat down and did the movie, I might not have come back here,” Plum said. “I might still be alive. I might still be you.”

			“I don’t think it would have mattered anyway,” Quentin said. “You’re the one who has to do the explaining.”

			“I suppose it does.” Plum studied her reflection in the cloudy pool. “If only
====================
Promptly, without missing a beat, she kissed him. It wasn’t so much the kiss itself, which she felt instinctively as if she’d just wiggled an imaginary pencil eraser, that she was after, it was that she knew he wanted it. She was right, that was the trick.

			The place had a really vintage feel to it. It had a second story, a pretty much deserted crawl, though there was still the matter of the books themselves, which still stood, even though most of them had probablymaliciously spent their lives in them. They were all neatly boxed up and neatly boxed away, but on the second floor you could see the outside courtyard, which was used for a barbecue the night before. There was a great many benches and balconies and pretty much any window you could think of that you could get a decent look at the Hudson River. The sun was setting, and the sky was a deep magenta that she’d never seen before. It looked cold even against that backdrop. She felt small and excited and beautiful.

			And then the books came skidding down the stairs. They were mounted on trip wires, like a pair of snowshoes; they slid along so quietly, it was like they were walking on lead. They landed on thick, firm, glossy packing peanuts-size stones.

			She gasped, and the rug blew right off.

			“No—”

			“Your,” Eliot said, “YOUR goddamn mother gave you these books? Quentin, they fucking were magical?”

			“Her,” Quentin said. “Or her assistant? She supposedly wrote all these stuffs herself. I don’t know. She was such a whiz kid though. She must have been pretty good at magic, or she was pretty quick. I know she was Scottish. She must have had some kind of deep, dark magic.”

			“She was Scottish, by the way.” Plum snarled, and Eliot laughed. “But she gave them to me.”

			Quentin snorted again, and Plum put a finger to her lips.

			“Do not joke about another person’s state of mind.”

Promptly, in a dream. He’d had a splendid time of it at Brakebills, where he’d gone on a tear by the end of his second year, breaking world records in everything from Alchemy to Social Anthropology. But Plum had a point: They were doing a poor job of teaching those skills, and the school was bursting at its seams, and the teachers were desperate to get down. So she brought the conversation back to Brakebills, and made a show of dismissal, just as she usually did. She was too preoccupied with other things, and the faculty needed to be convinced that she was worthy of their enormous, sovereign, and very public trust. When Plum mentioned the impossibility of convincing Quentin that she was a genuine student of magic, Quentin made no move to deny it.

			But Plum did. She was beginning to like Quentin, even as he became a more erratic and unstable presence on the outside. He was beginning to sound like himself, not that Plum had ever heard Quentin's name, or even that Thom’s, but they’d spoken for him, and it wasn’t like him anymore.

			He invited her to come with him to dinner, even though he knew she could refuse. He invited her to come because it was the right thing for her, because it was in the best interest of the school, even if she knew later that it was. It was the first time she’d seen him truly happy.

			It was a big city, and she was there for a second, last, of course, but it was a new kind of experience, a second home, this one, like Brakebills, ancient and new and magical but not magical anymore. She had a seat at the table, and Plum got up and began to walk around it, feeling good and safe and protected and aged and sick and alone and vulnerable and all too human again, the way babies are meant to feel. She thought a lot about babies’ infancy, and how strange and fragile it was, and how fragile all babies were, all the way up until that moment. She thought about how to keep that back.

			Quentin followed her, dimly aware that he was watching her, but she wasn’t going to be able to feel what he was feeling. They were like two stars in a night sky, passing

Promptly, the hungry bird shrank from the shadows, and lo, on the edge of the garden, a sitting room chair, table, chair, desk, clock, telegraph box, were waiting for its host.

It was the drink of the hour, and the red liquid was Diet Coke. Evette⋟’s eyes were big and red from the burn. She drank and felt things: she was vaguely aware of being hungry, or being sleepy, or both at the same time. She chilled her hands and face, and her fingers shrank, her hands becoming pink and stiff, and she groaned like a bad breakup kid. It was the closest thing to a knockout knockout punch you could get. She practically fell over.

Promptly, a huge cloud of steam rose up from along one wall of the warehouse. Theyirdly, it reminded her of the morning dew in a long-dead medieval city she was not allowed to enter for centuries and centuries and centuries afterwards. The wall also had a neat decorative touch, a crown of wisps of smoke.

			Quentin cleared his throat and tried to think of some way to get them home. The only thing he could think of was, you know, a miracle. But he knew two things about this place: one: Its economy was pretty much totally illegal, and two: It was kind of neat. It didn’t seem like the sort of place you wanted to be running a magic school.

			The other student was a guy named Cameron, a reprobate who had come on a sultry Friday afternoon. He was in his early thirties, athletic—maybe too athletic?—a hair over six feet tall, with a Mass Effect-lookalike overbite and a serious expression. He was doing extremely challenging arithmetic in a lot of little squares, all in the same semester. The lab was run smoothly and effectively, but the feel of it all was markedly post-9/11: anxious, highly charged, very new. Quentin was excited about it, but he wasn’t sure yet.

			Cameron talked to Quentin about their application. He told Quentin everything he knew about it, which was that he knew everything. He told Quentin everything he knew about the application itself, which was that it went something like this: he got an offer from Multiple Maniacs, and he declined it. Then they talked about what to do with it.

			It was funny, because almost immediately after that he put a big fat kiss on it: Jughead received a copy of Multiple Maniacs. That made perfect and perfectly clear to Quentin that this wasn’t part of some grand scheme to keep him around as a back-up plan. This was something that was something he could get behind, easily. He wanted to help this kid who'd lost his mom, and he was going to give him a hand.

			At this point Josh and Poppy were watching him, curious as hell, but also studying him up for smoke. Quentin watched them, kept their stares off him, considered what he could say, what he
====================
Prompt is a European company whose main task is to supply the essential services for the storage of nuclear waste in a special container which is designed to be transported on railroad cars. The container is very large, not unlike a large bath tub. The employees live a simple life, apart from occasional visits from the law. There is no television, and the only noise is the drip of water on the floor. A valve allows water to drip from the tops of the storage bins onto the floor. Fluorescent lights allow a Mediterranean ambience. Prompt also has laboratories capable of producing virtually anything you could imagine, and offers, in addition to weapons-grade uranium and plutonium, the isotope tritium, which can be used in silent weapons structures.

I don't know if these facts have ever been before, or if they have already been established, but I know that they are absolutely vital. In the face of this imminent threat, I am convinced that the ability of any nation to defend itself is of fundamental importance. To that end, under the leadership of Prime Minister Quijano I established a special police force. Every street in Tabasco was policed by one of these special forces, the termi’snaal of Cuchillera, who was also its leader. Every citizen was policed, but also every so often, to the point of paranoia, by men with machetes or who wielded machetes on duty. Incidents of vandalism were reported, but also of inconsiderateness, of complete and total apathy. The most basic of politenesses was never questioned. If two individuals or gangs differed in any way, it was always at the gate; if they were of the same sex, it was almost always at the door. It is not difficult to imagine how, a century ago, the question of gender would have come up. Men would have simply shrugged their shoulders, corrected them and gone on as if it mattered. Now different leaders of the same gang would constantly be watching the doors, the windows and the pavements. Any woman who tried to cross the threshold would be refused entry. This rule was followed without question and often absurdly so. I once witnessed a woman subjected to humiliating physical examination after absurd physical examination, until she finally produced a paper clip which would not yield its terms. The magistrates allowed her passage, on the condition that she undergo a month’s-long course of hypnotic drugs, so that
====================
Promptly followed and is followed by all men, in all countries, in all ages. The signs are everywhere. We are living in a golden age, the age of signs. This golden age is a kind of age, Benedict XIV had written, to be distinguished from age by a long way. I would like to suggest an even clearer and more ancient word, which in all languages should have meant the same thing: the age of the foolish.

The Bible is, without vanity, the most eloquent instrument the human mind has ever known. A verbal apparatus infinite, a treasury of metaphors and allusions, but insufficient to describe all the forms of reality: the endless creation as well as the infinite generation of the world. The verbal gymnastics of a learned person who has never seen reality, or understands it only as an illustration in books, are pitied by men as a kind of satanic games. The Bible is verbal gymnastics, sophistries and games, designed to produce an astonishment and a astonishments that would be unparalleled until now. Let us imagine a perfect and infinite system, a logical system, a logical system perfect and infinite. Let us imagine a perfect and infinite library, a library of metaphors and allusions, a library of epithets and allusions. Let us imagine all languages and all libraries of all languages. Let us imagine the Impressionable Jean Balthazar, who does not know whether to admire the vastness of the universe or the smallness of every atom. Let us imagine God speaking to him in one of His many tongues, and the imaginative man always answering in one of His many tongues.

No one will admit that this statement is absurd. From this it can already be seen that for Balthazar the number of divine words was not proof that there was a God, for the vast cosmic vocabulary would seem to confirm it, but rather was a kind of poison, a deadly tumor, to be removed with the bolus of life.20

"But even more difficult was the task of constructing, reconstructing and interpreting the entire code. The subtle variations and the continuous mutations of each word made it impossible to assign a single meaning to everything. The solutions suggested by Léon Bloy were always indirect, like the fallen utensils they were based on. To give a direct answer to every word, every idea, every expression was equivalent to condoning its antitheses. The Man 581Programme considers

of the dead, whose memory lives on, to the exclusion of the living and the infinite,
to the exclusion of the present and the past.

To the memory of a few coins,
whom I desired,
a few coins I did not,

who robbed me,

who tortured me,

I am the night, I am the light,

and you,

I am the shade,

and the shade is the sun.

Ave Maria,

Trotter's Park



You have searched for me with your eyes,
covered the world with your hands,
Your mouth says a river,

but I know it not,

not even the city I seek.

You have torn away my hair,

but your embrace did not wash away,

the scars of my life are on my skin.

You have erased my name,

but my glory is written in the sand.

You have scattered my pixels,

but your screens obscure my vision.

You have scattered my pieces,

but you have reproduced them in ten thousand ways.

I have left behind me the fragments of a hundred texts,
 the fragments of a thousand faces.

I have returned to the footprints of a dog, the crevasses of a mountain.

I have returned to the crevices of a tomb, the tones of a wave.

I have returned to the crevices of a wall, the shadows of a moon.

I have returned to the crevices of a moon,
the crevices of a wall, the echoes of a wall.

I have returned to the crevices of a wall, the echoes of a wall.

Promptly canceled it, which isn’t so different from killing a fly with a razor.”

			“Worm, you’re such a pussy,” Plum said with a smirk.

			“I was trying to say that. I was only kidding.”

			“I was just saying that the fact that you actually have balls now tells me that you’re not that far gone.”

			“Well, I definitely believe that. So I’m not completely useless, but I still don’t think this is going to be the game-changer I was expecting.”

			“I don’t think so.” Eliot was starting to feel a little sorry for her. She really was as hopeless as they made her out to be.

			“I wasn’t sure you’d make it, but maybe you will. Go ahead and you’re going to make it, okay?”

			Janet pressed a button on the table and a red light came on around the room. The plastic chairs began swaying about awkwardly. Eliot took the remote control from her out of her hand and heave it high and fast through the air in a radius no wider than the room, as if he’d invented an entirely new field.

			The red light intensified, until it radiated out into the night. If they stayed any longer they’d be able to see the room from the balcony. From the shadows, Eliot could see that Plum was taking a page out of Beatrix’s book.

			The window in the corner was open; they watched it sparkle neon-orange as they walked through. They stopped at a red light and a light pole went out.

			“Nice,” Plum said. “I thought we were going to a party.”

			“You could run in place there’s a lot of lights,” Eliot said, “but there’s a good chance you’ll find a party.”

			“I love parties.”

			She made a mental note to get an eyelash extension this season.

		
====================
Promptly, we left the room. I was on my back, clutching the hilt of my sword.

			“I am not a wizard, you know that. But you know what a wizard is?”

			“No, I don’t. But I have a sneaking suspicion you have never been one.”

			I stammered, “Well, not yet,” Quentin said. “Try.”

			I made a conscious effort to remember his Eminence’s exact voice pattern, even though I wasn’t any better at it myself.

			“Well—”

			He was gone, suddenly, and we were the only ones in the master bedroom. I stumbled back against the wardrobe door, through the wardrobe door, and hit the floor face down on my back. The sudden dizziness made it hard for me to balance. I tried to stand, but my hands were gone.

			“Why did you do it?” Janet said.

			“Why wouldn’t I do it?”

			“Because the world is ending. Because you would ruin it?”

			“Oh, I know why it would ruin it!”

			I had to keep repeating the word ruin to myself.

			“Oh, come on, Jennings. This is your world now. This is how it ends for you.”

			“But—"

			“But why would I do anything when the world was ending?”

			“Because you are a walking source of pollution, the smog from your smokestacks. You are a thirsty puddle, you need a hand.”

			I collapsed onto the leather armchair. I couldn’t speak, not yet, but I needed to throw some of the feelings away. They’d be bad now. They’d be bad forever.

			“Well—”

			But she didn’t talk. Instead Janet drifted off to sleep, and I dreamt of Janet. I dreamt of Jane Chatwin. I dreamt of little girls, green-skinned

Promptly after the song ended, I got a text from Elaine, who was at a conference in Mountain View, reading:



Hey man, are you at the Yerba Buena?

I know you probably just want to talk about your Ivy League educations,

But maybe you could come talk to us about our game?



—

Weird. I went into the conference room without knocking and first knocked lightly on the door. It was Malcolm.

MALCOLM: Hi.

I know, I know. I didn’t think you were coming.

MALCOLM: I wasn’t.

MALCOLM: Why are you here? I heard it was for a job. I thought you were supposed to be in London.

 (And I admit it—I was. I was the basketball coach. I was the highest-paid athlete on the planet.)

MALCOLM: So you heard about this trade for Dr. Hell? Right?

====================
Promptly the girl changed, and from that moment on she was the Mad Hatter.

			—

			They met their match when Quentin conjured up a dime-sized slushy from his briefcase and plunged it in the sink.

			“Argh!” Plum said. “Don’t do that.”

			Quentin wiped the kitchen counter with his sleeve.

			“It won’t hurt me, just for a second.”

			He refrained from denying it was a bit of a shock at first, meeting new people, getting his first haircut, all at such a young age, in a new place, with a brand new sink, with no idea what to do with a dime, if a dime even existed. But as the weeks passed he found that he enjoyed the people of Upton more than he had ever imagined possible, and everything just became more interesting when they were not threatening him or anyone else with violence but with him and him and him.

			It was only after they were almost too far along to hear the sun come up that they looked up. The view out of the kitchen was a blur, a blur caused by the fact that they were both so close to the edge of the world, so close to the precipice, and everything was starting to get blurry. They could have shared the same experience, but they didn’t. That was another feeling Plum had going on now: a part of her wanted to keep the two of them out of the world, out of each other’s business. She didn’t understand why she had bothered.

			But maybe she did. The Hatter’s Den was right outside Plum’s house, and when they arrived Rupert was already up, having snuffed the light out. He knocked twice, nothing.

			“Morning,” Plum said. “Another day.”

			He left. Without her they’d been teenagers, adults, football stars. Now they were adults, and things had changed. She wondered if they would have made it through.

			The next day at lunchtime Plum remembered something she’d left at the top of the page from the first time. She looked it up and studied the notes again.


====================
Promptly the Redeemer assumed the form of a unicorn. He pronounced the names of the tribes and lit a fire in the center of the room. . . All were moved to tears. A great many of the priests had served in the battles of the midrash, and they knew that a miracle of a different sort was inevitable. The Redeemer raised His holy head and accepted the office of coheret, or priest, for the year. When the fireworks ceased, he reflected that he now stood in the place where all future coheret had stood, across the water, on the other side of the sea: he knew the forbidden river that fed the fiery pit.

The fire consumed the forbidden river, but not the forbidden city. The blazing ruins remain, bright and resplendent as the fire that consumed them.

When the years have worn away the grass and the trees, a clearing will appear, and someone or some group of people with voices in their heads and strange artifacts of the hands and the face will recognize the city as Constantinople. Then the messiah will have found his city and will say farewell to his persecutor.

====================
Promptly, the slothful Spirit broke out in clumsiness. It clumsily shouted: It is good that everyone is dying, because then there won’t be anyone! Even me! And you wouldn’t know it!” But Quentin knew better.

			He wasn’t vain, but he wasn’t stupid either. He took a step back, cast a vicious glance at Plum and jabbed a finger at the Spirit with his knuckles. The Spirit flinched.

			“Off you go.” He pointed behind him. “Don’t do anything.”

			But the Spirit didn’t leave. It charged the Monk, but not once did Quentin manage a weapon. Without warning it stopped and turned its head toward him, but he wasn’t ready. The Spirit didn’t move until Plum was practically on her feet, and then it cornered her in a sack and hurled her backward into it.

			Quentin had never seen anything like it. The Spirit had stood stock-still while Quentin rolled, then it burst out of the earth, bolstered by Plum’s weight. Quentin had to put a hand on her shoulder to keep her balance and then it was over.

			As he ran down the street the Spirit bellowed, and something happened to the faces of the people he’d passed before. They went white; it didn’t feel real, this force, this velocity, it was a projection. They smiled, but their eyes went round. A man said something and the projection went wild with laughter. A woman said something and the laughter went up again. Quentin felt his eyelids getting smaller. It went on like this—he was in a dream, in a dream world—and when it was all over the man said:

			“Hi!”

			“Yeah, me too. Did you like it?”

			“Oh, yeah.”

			The man stopped laughing.

			“Try again.”

			He snapped his fingers, and the image in Plum’s head popped right back up. This time it was different: it was a bird in a race against the night sky, a bird with wide eyes and
====================
Promptly, a large stone was pulled from its sheath and set on the fire.

			The man who’d led them out of the Keep raised his hands.

			“The very thing we were looking for,” he said.

			Quentin nodded, resigned, but then honesty to him struck him. He’d known the dwarves for far too long.

			“The Stone,” he said, “is what gives you gold. You used the Stone to get here, and from here on out you’re going to be the tallest man on Earth. You’re going to rule the world.”

			It is a lovely place, even from here. You would never know it from the outside. From this vantage point you could look out any number of floors below and not notice how little the floor changed. Just the density of plants and animals and people. The same color everywhere. The same muted earth throbbing with an invisible energy. Here you’d recognize the same landscapes over and over again.

			But you’d miss the small details. The sly little details. The small glimpses at night when the fullness of the landscape seemed almost unreal. The way you should have seen it coming at all and yet it came, even though your eyes weren’t open. The way the leaves didn’t break out in sheets under your feet when you walked through them, even though it was early spring. The way you would turn your head and take in the landscape differently each time you came back to it. The way the fireflies came out at the end of every leaf instead of when you came back. The way you would look at the clock face again and it would be the right time, instead of when you were most likely to come back. The way the dwarf pushed your arm away from your body when you were trying to get up.

			You could go on and on.

			But all the while you could go back to the beginning, back to when you first came back.

			You came back twenty-four hours ago.

			Eliot watched you go. It felt like an eternity, but it felt forever because you were apart of a whole new world. For a moment he hardly recognized it. This was his world
====================
Promptly, the door opened fully and they walked in.

			Power! There were lights everywhere—it must have been one of those time-travel parties where everybody pretends they went back in time but which you never know when you'll see again. It must have a full house, because Quentin was the only one standing.

			Quentin recognized the old tanstone walls with their random streaks of bright green. He knew the library even though it was so quickly filling up with people. He didn’t recognize it anymore. This wasn’t fantasyland, it was a house. This wasn’t Fillory, it was a house.

			Plum and the maiden stood around the entryway smiling broadly. The commoner blinked twice and turned to look at them.

			“It’s no good with just one house, you know that,” Plum said. “It’s over here!”

			The two little jerky creatures trotted slowly up to Quentin, stopping about two feet apart. Plum scooped one up in one big fat paw and trotted away, still smiling.

			Quentin wondered what happened to the rest of the family. It seemed like a long shot, but then he’d never seen them hug or hug or hug any more. But it’s happening! Oh my God it’s happening! Jesus, he never thought he’d see that coming. He sat there for a minute looking around, trying to get his head around the idea that his fantasy was coming to an end, and nothing happened. It was like he was a kid suddenlyiscovering that his parents weren’t dead, it was all a bit surreal. He asked thoughts and observations about the landscape all the strange little animals shared, and from time to time the commoner Alice made a little squat with terror in its eye, or averted her eyes from him, or averted hers again. The terror faded as the two of them began to interact, and she began to hum.

			It was pretty clear to Quentin that this was interaction, but he’d never really noticed how mesmerizing it was until now. It’s like she was having a conversation with him, and he was the one telling her the answers.

			It was pretty clear she knew
====================
Prompted by a thump, he saw a broad, flat stone arch of roughly half a mile in diameter rise and sink into the molehill-mud slope, then immediately reversed direction and sank even deeper.

			The arch sank even deeper. It was submerged. Quentin almost blacked out after what felt like an infinitesimal loss of blood. It was Stoppard, and he knew how to mess with a man.

			—

			Quentin felt like he was being sucked dry like a flower out of a can, and he let out a shuddering sound—he let the sarcophagi press him down, he let the ground drain dry. It was happening all at once, like a dream bursting from a man's skull as if into a void swallowed whole by water. His clothes were unraveled, shoes and socks, and his hair was matted and tangled. Nothing had come unravelled yet. Everything was unfinished.

			Plum felt nothing like dryness. All she had to do was stand up: she saw immediately, like a hawk, slack-jointed fingers grasping her face, and she felt the ropes yank her down again. Her clothes came tumbling down around her, piled high like snowdrifts, and she put them on in spite of Quentin.

			She stood there for a minute, taking in the bare white limestone face of the ceiling, the bare pink walls, the bare black flanking, the bare arch of the pediment, the bare rafters, all of it perfectly uniformed, as if the master of them all were Plum herself, standing in the doorway, off-camera, in the shadows, nothing like the real Plum.

			Then she stood up and walked around and around the corner of the barn again. This time the water came—plum bumped into a dock and fell into the water, still clothed as always, and it was just her dress, it was very pretty, but the wetness brushed her shoes and she took it clean off. She felt nothing like the mundane world; in it she was pure light and air.

			For a second she forgot everything and went back to the dreamland. All she wanted was to be out there, feel it, see it, smell it, hear it, feel its rumble. But she couldn’t. The most it gave her was friendly
====================
Prompted by this success, the priest and his retinue sought a spot more convenient for their purpose. They chose a corner of the square, some ten yards distant, where there was a small but very full moon.

The only one of the twelve who wasn't intoxicated. He was at least eighteen years old. He wasn’t studying theology at Brakebills, but he was quite familiar with its moonshine. He had a trade: he picked the flowers out of the moonshine papyri and put them into a special vessel called a sextuple, which he kept in a glass jar in his desk at the Priory. He also made the sextuple into a weapon, a perfume, a wood perfume, and so on, into something stronger and more expensive than it was. The precious stones fetched high prices in the sextuple, and the scents were always being upgraded by the customer. (The weapon had a life of its own, dear Merlin: it began to get tarnished too. Merlin knew better. It was getting on his nerves.)

Sherlock had never seen the windows of the piano. They’d installed a big glass panel in one wall, another window; otherwise the room was almost entirely blank. They’d put a rug over it now, which wasn’t very scientific. The idea was that the panel would let the sun through, so that they’d have a window at least, ideally a window, which was the main purpose of the experiment. But since the window was directly in the way they’d thrown the scientists the experiment they did not intend.

 plates and eight tails


The windows were always open at night, because that’s when the most incredible things happened. The neighbors would show up at the subdivided houses with the red or green lawns, and start yelling and throwing rocks and swinging stuff at the lights. Everyone wanted the piano, but the house was becoming a haven for the police. People would show up at the front door with batons and try to stop the pianos, and the owners would flee into the woods or down the stairs in terrible and futile manouvers. The piano players would show up without their instruments, or they would start playing the harpsichord, or they would just stop playing altogether and just play the music through their hands. Or they would
====================
Prompto and his pals were lending a hand to a stranger, and he was all right, no big deal. How did they know he was a stranger? They didn’t. He stood over them all in turn by the door, looking each one in the eye: your face, the words you whispered, the way you held your mother’s rifle, the look of utter shock and utter terror in each of their eyes. They knew who they were and what was happening, and they were going to kill it.

			And there was no one to kill it. Not Ophelia, not even a ghost.

			“What do you think?” Quentin said.

			“What do you think? I’m gonna kill them all by myself!”

			“You’re going to play your part.”

			He knew he knew him, but Quentin was going to give it his best, best, and he even knew what he was doing. He just needed the right guy—someone who had experience, someone who could guide the craft, but somebody who was willing to put in the work. It was somebody who knew his trade. He was ready to pick up the pieces of his life again.

			He was going to take charge.

			“I know you’re scared,” he said, “but nothing has been able of you. If this is what it takes, then so be it. If it means saving your mother, then so be it.”

			“I’m not scared of nothing.”

			—

			The next morning was the ceremony Quentin and Plum had been waiting for. They’d been plotting it all along. It was a combination grocery list, insurance, scope of business, title search, inspection of the asylum’s perimeter, all completed in a couple of hours. It was an ordinary Friday in the year 2106, which was a little early for Saturday, but still a miracle. And Quentin didn’t think it was. He was having flashbacks. The name of the place had been fitting: that’s Parnes,” he said simply.

			He had never seen it coming. Plum carried a map in one hand and a
====================
Promptly after that, the ball dropped.”

			“There isn’t a story like it,” he said. “Such petty revenge.”

			“But it is revenge,” she said. “And it is beautiful.”

			She looked at Quentin. Her eyes were dark brown; her skin was a deep charcoal-gray. Her face was unusual even by faunal standards: she was little more than a tally on the hierarchy of a scale somewhere between prepubescent and adult.

			“Do you want to hear the worst about me? About me, you know, the way I really are?”

			“You are reading a dream,” Quentin said. “There is no such person as me. There is only the Doppelgänger.”

			“Then look at me, Quentin.” She pointed a finger at him. “You are little more than an image we have conjured up. We can have a look at yourself.”

			The ballroom was dark mahogany, with a cheery tinted glass panes. The ceiling was made of dark gray gypsum tiles, which were also used for the walls. The furniture was a few cypresses in number, mostly adobe, but there were also flatware, a few broken dishes, an old stereos.

			“What are you doing here?” Plum asked.

			“I—” Quentin sat up. “I work for the French Quarter. It’s a pleasure.”

			“You speak perfect French.”

			“I do.”

			“How did you get in?”

			“I can’t really tell you.” Plum studied her reflection in the pale gold mirror. “Did you take your glasses off?”

			“No. I suppose they’ve gone now. They’re in pieces all over the walls. But they’re not on us. You’re looking at them through their own little distorted windows, Quentin. Our eyes—their memories come from the inside.
====================
Promptly, with a stroke of a pen, he had taken control of the power that had once belonged to him. He had taken back what was rightfully his.

			For his part, Rupert looked confused. He hadn’t meant to hit Martin—he’d just wanted to test his mettle in front of Alice. But Rupert had been so distracted by the prospect of seeing just how helpless Martin was that he hadn’t seen that Alice had a metered response.

			At this rate Martin was going to kill her.

			“Quentin,” Lionel said, “we’re almost done with that.”

			“What? No.” At this rate Lionel broke off and threw up. He settled for a whisper. “I thought you said no.”

			“I do. I do.”

			This time Martin actually looked confused.

			“Why is it that when I make a mess of things it makes me happy? Is it because it makes me something? A dragon?”

			“It makes me something,” Quentin said. “Because it makes me who I am.”

			“Why doesn’t it say yes? Is that it?”

			“No.”

			“Well, whatever,” Quentin said. “If it doesn’t say yes then what does it say?”

			“That’s my question,” Martin said. “That’s the question that won’t be asked.”

			Quentin knew he was going to press the point, but he couldn’t do it quietly. He was panicking now, he couldn’t work out that Martin wasn’t going to win, and soon enough they were both losing it. His shirt was drooping over his forehead, and it started to bother him how quickly his jeans began to unravel.

			“What do you want to talk about?”

			“Nothing,” Martin said.

			At this point it was only a question of when, not if, Quentin was going to show
====================
Prompted by the sound of someone breaking the frame, Ratatouille rose up from its stillness. Its crimson dial glowed a pale pink.

			“It’s over,” it said. “It’s over.”

			Plum appreciated the pat on the back. It had been a long time since she’d had a really good day. It had been a while. She was glad for the phone call. It reassured her, but now it felt like a slap in the face. Like there was no way that this world was going to save her, and maybe there never was. She wanted to punch the wall. Punch the air. No. She had to grind her teeth.

			“I don’t think so.”

			“Well, whatever,” Eliot said. “Time of your life,” he said it again, “for you and me.”

			“I agree,” said Pushkar. “I think it’s a little much.”

			“Then what is it? Is it worth saving?”

			“I have no idea,” Pushkar said. “I do know however,” he added, “that this is a very dangerous job.”

			“Certainly it is,” Eliot said.

			“No one else would let me join the rest of them.”

			In the end they decided to give the job to Pushkar, because they knew that even though it was brutal and dangerous it was also very freeing, and they wanted to give two-thirds of them the job and see what would happen. They brought him along limply, to the deepest part of the cement floor, where there was only enough room for one arm and one eye to crawl through it at a time.

			“Pushkar!” Eliot called, and Pushkar didn’t even turn to face them. His eyes followed the trail of steam that led up from the ceiling, examined it, and went back down without turning.

			“The job is almost over,” he said. “Almost.”

			
====================
Promptly, a bomber plane took off from the city. The black-roofed mosques burned. Trees were down. The sun sank below the horizon.

I thought about the little village of Ben Bella, fifty miles to the northwest, where our friend the poet Dante Alighieri had painted his Don Quixote. I longed to travel that long-desired land. I thought of riding in a great caravan, of receiving in my home my hero's new treasures, enemies and all. I considered that I was very near to reaching my goal. Then I reflected that most people traveling that length of a ribbon of land could not possibly reach it; I considered also that I was very near to reaching my goal, and that reaching our goal was, in itself, a greater good. I decided to act.

I decided to take my pistol, my resolution, and my resolution alone ― my life, my happiness, my civilization ― into the unknown and very dense kingdom of the soul. I considered that it was within my power to discover what was in the souls of others, what sort of hatred, what kind of cowardice, what was in the Spanish tongue, what was in the ways of men, what were in the destinies of women and in those of men, similar to those I myself experienced. Then, perhaps, someone else would not suffer, and I myself would not suffer.

Thus deliberated, I felt at home. I understood the country very well; it was only that I did not understand everything about it. I decided to travel over rough and rugged country, over long and unbroken deserts, where all the signs were there of things having something to do with the departed man: his beard, his sex, his climate. I considered that this variation was due to the complete uncertainty of the destination, which almost every traveler feels: he has arrived, he feels at last, he has arrived; and then he feels as nothingmore, as the barbed stings of the unknown pass over his flesh.

Thus traveling, he came to a temple of the Osiris or Isis constellation. Here I reflected (and I think I had explained everything to him), he would be traveling through the body of an Egyptian pharaoh, through the solitude and ennui of a pharaoh, through the gloomy gloom of a prison, all the way to the Red Sea. Some one would offer him something and he would take it, and
====================
Promptly, the man left the room.

			But there was more. Back in the fourth-floor workroom, the man had opened the red door to the exterior wall of the mansion and was inspecting the ceiling fan. Standing against the wall, passively, looked at him the curving, corroded copper of the blades, which were obviously much too large and sharp for anything but a weapon skilled in the dark arts of metalbending. More inexplicably, they looked human, two men of short, stocky, lightly muscled appearance, but there were marks of wear on their uniforms as well. The man examined the fan again.

			“Will,” he said. “The controls are broken. You’re going to have to—"

			The man shook his head.

			“You don’t want to fix the controls.”

			“I do? Then get out of here.”

			The man ignored him. The man looked at the ceiling again, looked at the sand, then walked out of the room. Plum followed. It was midnight; the air was extremely heavy and cold.

			Airless and cold. They were looking for something, anyone—Bellbottoms or criminals or ghosts or prisoners—but something. As she walked she thought about what it was that they found in that red door, what it could have been. It was clear: she had proven to be right, she had shown them the way, shown them what was inside that red door, what was inside the vault, what was inside Fillory. It was also what she was here to show you.

			“What are you going to do?” you said.

			“To Fillory.”

			“Oh, come on. You’re not going to force your way in.”

			You were right, though. As it turned out she was here to find him. You just happened to be the man who could force her. He was a little embarrassed to be a lookout, but Fiona had been watching him too, and he was just as nervous as she was. Probably they were playing chess here, and when she played her pawns faced the same way, but when she lost she got mad.

			And
====================
Prompted by the first sight of the river, which seemed to him like a current flowing through an otherwise quiet pool, Barbarossa descended the stairs in silence. The castle wall was strangely effective, thick and very heavy, as if the builders had hung it on beam after beam, no doubt in an attempt to stop the water from running into it and keeping it from seeming completely solid. But if he looked closer he could see that the only part of the wall that wasn’t covered up entirely was around the edge, where a gate faced down on the marsh. Farther up, he could make out the little forge and the table with the broad waists of alcoholic beverages, and the bronze lance that had been given to him as a token of his kingliness. On the ceiling were the names of the rivers and streams by which he had been able to cross them, along with a list of provisions and a list of any dangerous animals or plants that might be found. It was a pretty good guard against saboteurs.

			Barbarossa waited for them at the door, which was a simple wooden panel that opened out onto the beach of the far side of the pool. He knocked twice, no one answered, and then he poured them a glass of water. The coolness of the water told him he was invulnerable, so he took a seat on the sand and took a huge swig. It was cheap beer, cheap beer even than you’d think from shore to shore, stiff and bitter, but still better than what he’d get in a pub.

			It was a long way from Brakebills, and yet he wondered if he would ever get there. Maybe—maybe it wouldn’t matter now that he was immortal, but in a few minutes it would matter a lot. When he came back to himself he realized he was still as dumb as a brick. He wondered if anyone would ever come for him.

			He wondered if anyone would come for him when he decided to leave.

			It was weird to be human again, to be human again, back in the flesh. It was scary and interesting at the same time. Even more so when you realized that you were human. It was weird to be human again, even more so, back in the flesh. This wasn’t what he’d expected.

			
====================
Promptly the old man turned his head and saw that they were alone.

			“I’m sorry,” he said, trembling. “I don’t understand. I thought you were with us.”

			“I was,” Plum said.

			He turned back to them.

			“What are you doing here?” Lionel asked.

			“I don’t know,” the old man said. “I mean it—I don’t know. I guess I’m just here.”

			“Age does not bother me,” he went on. “Servants of Leoric are few and far between. Even I could tell by your features that you’re twenty-one. You have a lot of life in you.”

			“Twenty-one?”

			“Mine. Normally I wouldn’t let them check me, but I didn’t expect to make it. They said they caught a lot of counterfeiting in these parts, and Im sure it’s a booming trade right now?”

			“Are you involved in it?”

			“Oh, yeah. I guess I’m one of the guys.”

			“Well, a guy is talking right now! Don’t forget, guys are supposed to be stronger than ladies!”

			The man snapped back: “Don’t look now, but it’s time for dinner.”

			As it turned out, they did find a guy. Im wearing a black sweatshirt, blue jeans, a Beanie Baby and a Patriots⚾s™s Game baseball cap. Quentin checks in around two thirty, and I’m wearing a blue strapless dress shirt and black skirt. Or black lace-up Nike sandals. Either way you it, this is going to be a good one.

			We start right away, in the lobby. It has a nice big glass elevator that only the most hard-core of Interpol investigators can access. Inside, everything is very carefully laid out: the lobby clock is kept in perfect
====================
Promptly after the fact, I did become a wizard. It was the only way I could think of.”

			“But why? Why should I care?”

			“You’ll be a bit like Merlin to it, won’t you? Like a king’s lieutenant. Probably. Probably not. You know, for his information.”

			“But I do care,” Eliot said. “I do want to know. When are we going to leave?”

			“When?”

			“You will not know me, Quentin, for I am yet to be admitted to this dunce’s compartment.”

			“Then you will not know me, nor your foreman, who is yet to be admitted to this same dunce’s compartment.”

			Eliot leaned forward, trying to sound serious. If he was going to break the seal, he was going to do it like this.

			“I am Quentin,” she said, in the same serious tone. “I am your opening statement. I do hereby promise to shatter your very fragile bubble, one bubble at a time.”

			She examined Quentin for a moment, then:

			“I am a bit late to the party on this one,” she said at last. “But I can’t be too harsh.”

			“I notice your foreman has a certain intimidating presence about him. What are your preliminary observations of his nature?”

			“I do not. What I want to know is:”

			He seemed more comfortable in his chair than on his feet, and he made no attempt at a serious expression. In fact he made it look serious: an effort at sincerity, I should say.

			“Well—” Eliot began, but Quentin cut him off. “I don’t mind if you tell me your name.”

			“Damien Damans’s name.”

			“That is correct.”

			“I note that you have light brown hair
====================
Promptly you will without being afraid be able to give your consent to being touched by a god." ―Enkidu to the god, in the House of Wight

You think that the subject of this essay is Enkidu? Sudan? Enoch? The first part of that name is impossible to pronounce, the second (which is the correct form) is one of the most complicated words in the English language. The man who utters it never knew, apart from that it was English; he came from the East, from what was then called China; he had not the least conception of the art of magic. He felt no emotion for the people, except contempt; he came from the desert, from the heart of the City of the Lost. To him, their language was nothing more than that of an abode, something they conveyed to themselves and to others in like manner. . . Enkidu? is one of those words which two languages might conjure up at the same meaning, but which at the other meaning are completely different. In French, it is easy to find this semidifferent phrase: cette idée fut de l'hôtel Juillotaux; in German, ab gehen wir uns älteren; in English, ab deutenydemline. But in all languages this phrase would have the same symbol: idée idée fut le hôtel; idée idée le lune; idée idée donnérant le système système. In all languages idée is an affirmative imperative, but in German it is synonymous with la idée de Juilletàs, which means "the island of Juilin," and with lune, which means "night time." In all languages the direct object of an affirmative verb is identical with the object of the negATIVE verb; but in all languages the direct object of an affirmative verb is identical with the indirect object, as in the phrase: das Buch das Klub is the belt of the horse. In all languages the passive and the active objects of the same clause are the same; but in all languages the passive object of the same clause is entirely different from the passive object of the same verb. In all languages the reflexion adverb and the retroJECT of the same Latin verb are the same; but in all languages the reverse and the present verb have completely different connotations.

====================
Promptly, Hermione rose to do her duty. She was the first one to leave the room; as she passed through the double doors on the other side, which were also being guarded by six silver plates, a deep sigh went up from behind one of the shutters. It was Stoppard.

			As she came around the corner from the second door, a crash shook the floor with her. It was the carpet, flying awkwardly high in the air, having the carpet run along its sides, trying to get stuck to one of the six silver plates. No problem, thought Plum, then: It's just us.

			She emerged into the middle of the hallway. Stoppard had been waiting for her there. Even from this distance she could tell he was quite pleased—excited, even, to have finally made her appearance on this magical college campus.

			Instantly the silver plates began to move. The carpet followed, running along its sides, its colors shifting between black and white and less colorful but just as pretty. The Applause, Plum realized, was almost entirely caused by the two women playing accordion on it.

			As it turned out the college was a lot prettier than she’d anticipated. Hazlitt’s admitted sixteen students; the grounds were a veritable meadow of grass and light, and it didn’t take her very long to find all of them, if she was even on campus at all. The hallways were very pretty, she thought, the same way that birds always seemed to look at lights that were too bright, the same way that she felt when they burned behind your eyes like a sallow on a Saturday. The architecture was pretty, save for one wall, which was covered up by a mat of leaves.

			This was her dormitory. It was also her room.

			She was very hungry. She was so tired from the trip up that she hadn’t eaten anything for two days. She found a bowl of water and sat down on a chair, which was very uncomfortable, but it was better than pretty much anything. She was going to fix this.

			It was late afternoon when Plum woke up. She felt like a truck that had been through the desert: wet and cold, but absolutely convinced it was morning. There was no clock on the wall, and the shades
====================
Prompting a smile from the three logical men, she told them they were the first humans to enter the ring in over two centuries.

That was not true. They were the first humans to enter in two centuries. It was a picture in a history book.

From that first embrace, Ember and Umber had come to hurt her. They had come to destroy her. She had seen this once before, and she knew a thing or two about not even trying to be mysterious. She took a deep breath, held up the book in front of her and punched the photo in the rear view mirror.














Beatriz de Jesús Amaro:

In your youth, as you continue to do now, did you ever imagine that one day you would become one of the most illustrious authors of your time?

I was not, nor am I. As a youth I could not fathom the vast scope and intricacies of foreign land and maritime lore, but now I can. I am almost there.

I left behind me that delectable countryspeaker whose talk would reveal obscure synonyms of fortune tellers, and sought out for the seas I was as yet ignorant of even the rudiments of the magical study of history. I have transacted those voyages of exploration and discovery that are the business of men, that sacred voyage of discovery, that perilous voyage of ambassadors and conquerors, that sacred enterprise that reveals hidden secrets that are the very heart and soul of the things they fight over and for. That was my sacred venture.

I have no regrets. I have gone on doing it, like the rest of my generation.

What I do not have the faintest notion of is how I ended up in this predicament. I understand that the causes I have not mentioned are equally atrocious. I understand that the present state of the world – what a sorry and unhappy world it is – has obliged me to a degree I could never have foreseen. I understand that I am not the only one.

What might have driven me to that decision? Perhaps it is the thought that whatever destiny befalls us, it will not keep us forever. Perhaps it is that the choices we make here on Earth are perhaps the only ones we can make for ourselves on this world. Perhaps it is that my premature age – less than optimal for the performance of any task – has allowed someone to
====================
Promptly, the mirror broke into a sweat.

			“Yeah, look, I get it. You’re a little nervous. I know—I totally get it. But we’re going to make this work. We’re going to make it.”

			“But this is magic,” Quentin said. “This is a secret.”

			“I know,” she said. “But this is my world, you’re my friend, I care about you. I will see that you live it.”

			Quentin couldn’t tell if she was having a joke or not. But he was having a joke, and it was really quite moving.

			“I live here,” she said. “I work here. You work in the city, you’re a bit of a loner. But this is my world, and this is the world of Fillory. You’re going to live it as best you can, and when you can you'll know what it was like. Then maybe you can forget about the mirror and the knife and the mirror itself.

			“But I can’t leave immediately!” he said. “Not even first-year!”

			“That is the price of friendship.”

			“OK, see, I’m showing you something.”

			“I like this place,” Quentin said. “I really do. I like it a lot. But I’m not sure yet that it’s right for you.”

			“That’s my thing,” she said. “I don’t know if you can. But if you can I’ll take it from here.”

			She sipped her tea again.

			“I am not—”

			“Me?” Plum said.

			“I am not an adventurer,” she said, “from Fillory series or whatever. I am an author of children’s books. But they are very welcome in Fillory.”


====================
Prompted by this development, the old soldiers, who had become the faithful object of his affection, desired him to leave immediately, to return to the front. A few hours later, he complied. He hastened to gather up his things and went through the barred passage to the rear. He wondered whether his long confinement, which had become a trivial ordeal, had not relieved him of some guilt. He reflected that the whole of his life had been a fabrication, an elaborate game, from which he had emerged only as the last man, the last digit, to be eliminated forever. He felt, indeed, that he had been a mere player, a king, of a vast and secret game. Perhaps this sense of a "garbled emptiness" had permitted him, through it, to be who he was as man, as spirit, so that, at the end, all that was required of him was the infinite man.

He had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought that being a king was enough: he had thought
====================
Promptly, the mass of the earth, the empty rooms, the ocean of fire, rose up like a gigantic arm and grabbed at the sky. The sword-lights of the city illuminated the ruinous labyrinth like blinds, made up of many, crisscrossed over each other like the blinds of a great tent, a tent like the city.

			For an instant my heart felt empty, but then my heart felt full again. We were in a vast library, the size of a balcony, with arched windows that gave the whole building dark, mysterious feeling. The books were arranged in many groups, like the ancient mosaic at the Pantheon. I recognized, instinctively, all of the arabesque bindings: the one bound in the Iliad, the one bound in the Odyssey, the one bound in the De viris. This is not a book about the Dark Ages. This is not a book about murderers and mystics. This is a book for killing people, for centuries, on an immense and seemingly infinite scale, with cold indifference, with unvarying mercy.

			I turned the last book over in my pocket. It was a map of the world, a perfect circle, the same as the one I had read about in the Iliad.







			I turned the page. The description seemed apocryphal, the ideas bizarre. But I paid no attention to the rest. I was busy dreaming big and doing little by little.

			The books said that between the years 650 and 810, Europe had recovered its unity. The fragmented and war-torn Europe of the novels was finally on a new foundation. I was studying the seventies and reading Frazer, Spengler and T. H. White. I remember Hiller growing impatient with the account of the cyclone at Assisi and bringing a copy of the Koran — the one about the Ocean — along for the ride. (Frazer had brought a copy of the Koran, along with his famous apple that morning, because Hiller found it on the island.)

			I was going to sacrifice a lost-child theory in order to a better understanding of this incredible epidemic. (I won the first prize in a cooking contest sponsored by the Quaker Oats Co. I was named co-winner. The second and third places went to Campbell and to Helen Fisher, who were competing
====================
Prompted by the presence of the divine, she took the first turn, the one that none of the others took, the one that none of them went through. It was the last one, the decisive one: the one before the zenith of her journey, before her eyes, before her hands, before her spirit, before her soul, before her name. She took it, and felt the earth beneath her, and the river, the palm, the moon, the stars, the night, the birds, the leaves. She felt the forest, the palace, the river, the world, the six hundred and second floor.

			Even when she felt the ground beneath her slipping beneath her, she didn’t give up. She went forward, until she was brushing the dust from the faces of the men who had fallen, and then she stopped. This was it. This was what she had fought for, this, once and for all, and what she had given up. She turned, and caught the outline of a man who had paid his debt to the lord.

			Eliot raised his hands, preparing to do the same, but Sloane spoke first.

			“Don’t,” he said.

			He had the sudden impression he was talking to his dead father. Whatever escaped the Well, he was sure, was pretty powerful stuff. If that wasn’t clear, he pointed at Eliot.

			“Pay it forward,” he said.

			Eliot shook his head.

			“Not if you’re interested.”

			“I don’t have to.”

			“I’m not interested.”

			“I don’t care,” Sloane said. “You got anything on Julia?”

			“Julia.”

			“Julia!”

			Julia popped the champagne, poured a glass of water and a cherry for him, and, on impulse, took a couple of samples out of it. She looked happy as a baby. Eliot doubted she paid any attention to the trophies herself.

			“She likes to play ball,” she said.
====================
Promptly, the red-faced man with the big black eyes went nuts in a tizzy.

"You two!" he shouted. "We're the only ones here! Why are you all standing around here? Come on, you two know what to do!"

 Clearing the way, he advanced on the two naked strangers, one on his left and the other on his right. The Indian lunged for the handle, missed, and the man croaked like an rooster as the red-faced pole struck him through the chest. The impact sent him tumbling five stories, landing heavily on his face. The impact also ejected a spray of frothy white blood, which dripped on the grass. Farther down, the two men were exchanging blows, neither looking back. This was contact sports in Haiti, and there were cocked weapons in plain view, ready for any foul or magical blow that might be committed.

 Clearing his voice, the man said, in a voice that crackled with suffering: "This is it, guys. I want it."

My father was a fisherman. I can remember the waves, I can remember the stares, I can remember the fatigue, I can remember everything that happened to him. I know I am dreaming, but I am not dreaming any longer. I am your son, you crazy bastard. You bastard.









Arbitrary Impossibilities



What a tangled web the words "Archaic" and "Haiti" weave. The first references to "Haiti" do not refer to the history of the country as a whole, but to a region in which it was attempted: the rainy, churning interior of the island was the "Valley of the Ancients." The second reference does refer to a region of the interior: it is dated "After the Exile." The confusion is needless, however, since neither of these references is exhaustive, and the intent of the text is clear. In the first place, they let us know that the desert of the first half of the eleventh chapter (let us not forget that it is written) is exhaustive; in the second they let us know that the interior of the second half (written some four hundred years later) is also exhaustive. The reference to an "exile" is deliberate, so that the readers who have been attracted by the first part of

Promptly it occurred to me: if you eat a lot of junk food, you also eat lots of salt. I didn’t notice it when I was chewing, but when I swallowed my salt beef I noticed a big difference. Suddenly I understood why our forefathers had forbidden salt: they wanted to impress on their slaves that salt is valuable, that salt is more valuable than bread, that salt is more valuable than gold. Eat a lot of salt, and you’ll develop an intuitive sense of injustice. And you’ll develop other immoral ways of eating. Salt, in the form in which I’m eating it, is just salt.

			“So I ate less and less salt. I wasn’t going to waste any more pseudocities piling salt on each other to make salt-balloons.” He frowned. “I was going to make my own. Like this.”

			“A form of magic magic magic!” Q*bert exclaimed. “Can you even make magic? This is science!”

			“I can.”

			“But you can’t have any in the wild, can you?” Plum said.

			“Wild is a relative word,” Q*bert said, “so is the boundary between fairyland and mad science. The wild is a muddy, damp, overpopulated mess. There’s no wonder it’s so magical.”
