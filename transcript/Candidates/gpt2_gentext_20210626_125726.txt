Eternity" or "Eternal Love." If "eternity" was the eighth dimension, then "eternal love" ― the second kind ― was the third. If the third kind of love ― matrimony ― were the Kingdom of Heaven, then matrimony were the lowest form of matrimony; for matrimony to become the Kingdom, matrimony have to cross the threshold of matrimony. Matrimony are the tiniest of conjugations; conjugation with maturity is the third kind of conjugation; conjugation with maturity is the fourth kind of conjugation; for that reason, the Kingdom of Heaven is the third kind of love; for that reason, all sexual intercourse is the fourth kind of intercourse. Matrimony to which I belong is the fourth kind of intercourse. Matrimony to me is not carnal, but intellectual; matrimony to me is not a contract ― a promise ― but a state of the heart. And so I have said: matrimony to me is not a promise but the expression of the most acute and singularly sensitive heart."

"I understand him," said Dr. Luis F. Azevedo, "to be the Viennese Giordano Bruno. . . Dr. Azevedo then examined the manuscript. He saw that in the left margin there were thirty-two lines which, taken together, formed the whole text. He noticed also that the words age, nadie, rudimento, nadie nadie, appeared at the end of the line just quoted. Concluding that this supported the hypothesis suggested by the second hypothesis, he placed the text in its proper place and began to read:

Eternity and Change

But I had rather be dead than live in the world. For the world is a mockery, a mere confusion, of everything and everyone, everything that is, everywhere and only in the Now. All things were one, all things were one; all things are one. All things are one, all things are complete. All things have one cause, one effect, one proportioned to all things by one Divine Cause. All things are of one substance, one effect, one cause and one effect. All things will act in perfect coordination with one another, with no other state of nature. All things will act in perfect coordination with no other circumstance; all things will be without excuse; all things will be praised. All things are perfect. All things have no subject; all things have no mind. All things have no identity; all things areidescribe a divine name, a singular name, a negative name, a positive name, a self-contradictory name, a self-abasementing name, a self-abnegating name. All things are causes and effects and effects in common. All things are relations and relations in common. All things are universals and particulars and perceptions; all things are conjunctions and correlations. All things are acts in one and in many and one and many. All things are forms and transmutations. All things are the sleep of death. All things are the ruin of art. All things are the dimness of the soul. All things are the chain of the moribund. All things are the love of the world. All things are parables in another world. All things are the dregs of a nutritious banquet. All things are days that were and were not. All things are the return of a fugitive. All things are the failure of an embouchure. All things are the creation of a great man. All things are the secret plans of a woman. All things are the malignant influence of a vicious spirit. All things are the accumulation of a just inheritance. All things are the happiness and the misery of a just man. All things are the justice of a just God. All things are the opinion of an unjust man. All things are the language of a just God. All things are the practice of a just science. All things are the practice of a just gymnasia. All things are the practice of a just fire. All things are the progress of a just fire

Eternity and the Light of Dagda. In the past the fates of men have been almost identical. The course of the world is always the same.

The Waiting



He who fears Allah will also wait, and he who waits will see Allah's reward. Verily God loves those who wait, and He loveth those who see.

Job, chapter xi

In the desert of Kashmir (in 632 AD), the last prophet of the orthodox faith, Abu Talib, feared Allah alone and waited for His reward. Three centuries later, the fear and wait of the faithful remain as the jihad in Afghanistan and the darkness and wait of time itself.

The books of Islam contain innumerable wonders. Some, like the Bible, are poems; others, like the Koran, are charts. Some, like the Bible, are remembrances or reflections of a single moment in time; others, like the Koran, are the Collections of the Heavens. All these works of literature and manuscripts are sacred writings, evangelical in character; yet, Abu Talib's fear and wait are treasonable. They are treasonable, I say, not because they are evangelical in character, but because they are subversive. Not evangelical in the matter of finding a way to God, but subversive.

Treviranus observed, formerly and more cogently, that the invisible and incorporeal are prior to the visible and material universe. The universe is prior to the mind; for that matter does not exist without my mind. I exist prior to the universe; for that there is nothing existing between me and the other who is subject to it. I exist prior to the past; that very moment I was the other to whom the past and the future are prior. There is not, I repeat, any such difference between the past and the future. The future is for us already here; the past is absent. The past exists prior to the universe; the universe is future without me. The universe exists prior to the mind; the mind exists prior to the whole series of being. There is no such thing. . . I exist prior to the universe; the universe exists prior to myself. The very phrase, the very essence of
====================
Eternity. In the last book, it is written that the last men shall die fighting for the right to eat the apple they have sown in Paradise; in the first pages of the second book, it is written that the sun will die fighting for the right to rise up to the thirty-fourth parallel. In the marketplace of Delicourt, in the arena of Fontainebleau, men have died for the right to eat apples; in the labyrinth of Bachelier, for the right to be understood; in the desert of Camus, for the right to be beautiful. . . For the first men, the memory of that which was and what was not; for the second, of what is and what ought to be.

What is it to be beautiful? Van Ormanque asks, but I can perceive in me an emotion of great depth, a deep love of what is beautiful, a vague, almost passionate gratitude. I feel that I am after all beautiful, and I know myself to be beautiful, because I am in love with this conviction. Once this conviction has entered me, I cannot be ugly, not even in words; I am ugly in the eyes of the people; in thought and in the thoughts that make up my being. How can I be a common whore, a common drunk, a common rogue, a common lewd man? No one esteems what is common more than we do. The more common things become, the more we distrust the things common people esteem. In the olden days, before the grand dukes and earls of this world, there were great heroes and there were great monsters; in the new world, there are just as many great men as there are monsters. The new man is clever, farsighted, of noble birth; old tribal afflictions fade from his memories, but new ones come back that were new just as fresh, and they haunt him still. What is new is the man he has become.88

The habit of rejection disappears; new things interest me and are of a congenial stamp. I let myself be lured into things simply because I thought they were interesting; I did not supervise my curiosity or try to understand it. A hundred years ago, I did not know whether to be happy or sad; I know now that I am miserable. I am glad that so many people around me are happy; I am glad that so many people are surprised to hear that I

And even in that single empty space a gleam of life shone.

And that gleam was spread out, so that two of the men could see it at a time. And they stood there dumbfounded, speechless, save for that single sound, the rustling of the grass.

Then the face of the Unknown, the greatest of all faces, smiled back at them:

It was a face of rage and destruction.

====================
Eternity was scarce, but we had a thing or two left to learn.

			“All right, all right!”

			“I am going to teach you something!”

			“What?” Plum looked up and met his eyes. They were hard and warm and somehow familiar. “This is ancient history.”

			“It is.” He took a deep breath and went on. “Before this civilization, before us, everything was the same. The world was red, the forests were black, the trees were divided into three kinds—the leaf, the stump and the tree. The sun rose from the soil every morning, the birds sang to you in trees, there were monsters in the jungle only you and I were different, there was always more rain than there was snow. Nothing changed forever.”

			He sat up and began pacing.

			“It turns out that having a bunch of big fires in the middle of the desert doesn’t make a land hospitable to people. Cities suck the life out of the desert. When you have a whole desert lying around, and there’s no land to stick people on, things go wrong. Civilizations die out. People go to war. All because one desert people decided that another wasn’t making enough of its own thing.”

			Plum was transfixed. Far away, deep in the American southwest, something had just happened that we’d never seen coming. I felt my wings folding and relaxing around me, and Nina set them back against a branch.

			“What did you say?”

			“It’s a cancellation,” she said. “If there ever was one.”

			“But it isn’t a cancellation.”

			“It isn’t a cancellation! It’s got plums in it!”

			A wisp of a flame blossomed on Pushkar’s jet-black beard, and on the crown of his head. It took a few seconds for the flames to die down.

			“What is it?” Plum said. “I feel like we are being followed.

Eternity, or even the entire cosmos. You might be able to find them on a gravestone, but you couldn’t possibly believe in them.

			“You couldn’t find the damn thing, could you? You never would have found it, and now you’re going to show me how it got lost.”

			Quentin was unbuttoning his shirt. It was time to go all in.

			“I don’t know if this is the right place,” he said, “but this isn’t the time for conversation.”

			“All right,” Plum said. “I’ll just walk you through it.”

			Quentin did as ordered. He took a deep breath, and a long, shaky one, and he chanted a few simple mantras, like a Taoististististist mantra, or an OBE kind of thing. Quinton’s body language was like Jedis’s—he was concealing something, and he was going to let Quentin see it for himself.

			When they were out of earshot it was still very early, but the mood was good. They were playing with themselves, the boys, in a playground—the next borough over—and Quentin was getting into it with Pushkar.

			“Pushkar,” Quentin said. “He’s not right, but we’re getting along like this.”

			“Pushkar is right-handed.”

			“Look at me! Look at my hands!”

			“They’re silly, but they’re right-handed.”

			“Hang on, I’m not saying that’s true.”

			“What about your other hands? Are those also right-handed?”

			“Those too.”

			“So you are telling me that you are people’s magician?”

			“People?” Quentin said. “Wait, Spike?”

			“Your family?”

			
====================
Eternity. The balance of the world is changed. It is not the man who is unfortunate, but the world that is unfortunate.

Something like this has happened to me. I was in a convent, on the rue de Toulon. One of the sisters brought a bottle of brandy. I recognized it as the one the lawyer had given me; it was a very large bottle. She ordered two pints.

I went to the parlors. I studied. I remembered things from my childhood. I felt sad and nostalgic emotions. I felt, perhaps, that I had not only failed the sister I had hated, but also the world. Around one o'clock, I left the parlors and went to the corner of Notre-Dame and Jeulnes.

I remember that the streets were full of people who knew me by reputation, because it is known for its reputation that afternoon. A young man of means passed in and out of the house with a letter in his hand; a female relative came in and left a message; a woman who had been in the bordre with her child came out to buy a cookie; elderly people came out for a cup of coffee; there were couples who sat on the porch and exchanged pleasantries; there were children who wore French stars; there was a group of five who spoke perfect French; there was a stranger against the blue wall who wore a green shirt; there was a rosary around one's neck. A cab took them to the corner of Notre-Dame and Chartres.

From the house in which they were dining I heard the bellman's watch graze the silence of the street. I got out. It was nine o'clock. I was in the company of my secret chamberint's half-smile and half-scowl and in the company of Anne Heche's half-laugh. . . Suddenly the bottle in Anne Heche's hand stopped.

"Are you drunk?" Anne asked me.

I started, but Anne spoke slowly:

"Of course I am drunk."

I am drunk, I answered her.

"You know this, don't you? I just can't stand being managed by a girl who is so drunk."

I answered already that I did, that I did.

"You know I never get drunk," she said. "Why the hell should

Eternity War to End All Wars. He rose from the chair and began to walk toward the door. When he got to the other side the guard stopped him.

			“Would you mind telling me how you got here?”

			“I know,” Quentin said, embarrassed. He got up and walked briskly through the door, rubber-banding whatever was in front of him, whatever was under the table, whatever was suspended from the ceiling with one hand. It was disconcerting—the door didn’t react to his movements. He checked with Fabricius, who was upstairs working on something while he was out. “I know how to get here. Help me, I’m begging you.”

			Plum picked up the phone and began rubbing her fingers across the glass with one uplifting thumb.

			“Plum, are you sure you don’t want to do this?” Quentin said. “I mean, it’s pretty awful and you’re pretty close to the point, and you are very powerful, and you could probably kill this Father figure if you wanted to.”

			She shook her head. “I guess I am. Quentin, for Christ’s sake get out of this situation. This is serious.”

			“Seriously? Seriously? I am serious. This is serious. Are you seriously serious?”

			“Seriously? I assure you I am.” The guard gave up. He held up one finger, a sign. “Call it quits, you dirty old crow.”

			Quentin shrugged.

			“No more phone sex, you dirty bird.”

			The guard hung up. Plum had made her peace.

			“Well, here I am.” She thought. “Looks like we got the hang of it, you and I and Father.”

			She knocked on the door. Nothing.

			“New plan,” the woman said. Not electronically, anyway. Silent tape. A door. “Shit.”

			More knocking. In the gloom there was less light, but the woman was not moving.

The Kingdom and the Kingdom's King



And now it came to pass after many dreams, that one of the sons of Isildur fell headlong into the hold of Ship: his name was Sigmundurzi; his enemies pierced him almost every nerve in him; they broke his legs, ribs, hips; they severed his ear, which served them for a vice: then they bound him up and sent him abroad in the nations; there were divers cavils against him: some said he was a sorcerer; others that he was a priest of an elemental god. These absurd stories greatly distressed the people; Sigurdinus the high king in his complacent spirit sent men to ask their ear, whether one of them was right or another false. Those who heard the king's deliberation resolved never to trouble him with their people's business; they sent men armed with swords and lances, rich in arrows, and with bows and arrows themselves. These omens were good; Sigurdinus' majesty repented him and blessed the luck. Many years later, when the ship was in bad health, King Sigmundus showed himself at the gates; his envoys begged leave to vent their fury on their persecutor. A violent oath was complied with; Sigmundus, with such words as these, spurred his horse and flew away.

Men have written that Sigurdinus saw the future and Cowperthgar saw the past. This, however, seems a paltry testimony, as it attests nothing more than the generality of men's words. Histriones (Book V of his work City of God) relates that the Lernans (the ancient Lydians) used to adorn their shields with games of chess, and that the very board showed them that the man who defeated the loser was the winner. This much, which is unquestionably true, but not that the knights knew anything about history. It is more credible that they knew that their war was the loser's first appearance on the board; and that the man who defeated him had won the chessgame.

Sigurdinus, perhaps, did not know that history began with Frode; but it is more credible that he knew that the games of chess and of the forest and of the fire showed him this,

			“I realized then that there was no other way out of this. I didn’t have a second. I was going to take the last stand I could. I was going to save Fillory.”

			“You saved Fillory, Alice.” It had to be. She didn’t look like she had much more life in her than she did life in prison. Alice didn’t look like she had much less in her than she did earth. She might even be a little older than she looked. Maybe she was a half god. “And I’m not going to be a half god anymore. I’m not paying my dues anymore. I’m out of this fucking league.”

			“I took a deep breath. I wasn’t going to give them what they wanted, not after what they’d asked for. I’m a god now.”

			She glared at the clock face for a long time. It was a lovely clock, and it gave the wrong time, but she was still right, it really did run counter to everything that she’d been taught in a fucking order room in Brakebills, and in a vault somewhere. If that was the case then what was the meaning of the order? She would find out.

			“The meaning of the order,” she said, “is totally in doubt right now.”

			“What meaning?”

			“The meaning of the order is that we’re in a magical Cold War with the Rippers. Who else but the Rippers would mess that up?”

			“Oh, I don’t know.” Alice sighed. “I guess I’m just saying that it’s really not in the cards. You’re going to have to do it on your own.”

			“But I—”

====================
Eternity, an age of infinite stars, of lasting days and nights, of rivers and seas and luminous mountains and men and the subtle arts of magic. I am suggesting, I ask you, that the expectation of a future which is not this present one, not the past but a future which is not this present one, is a sufficient reason for destroying it. I do not know whether you agree with me.

Another objection you may raise is this: If love is an end in itself, if its terms ― affection, fidelity ― are mutually agreed upon, how can it be an error to commit a sin? I answer: This very agreement makes it an error to commit it. When two parties to an agreement commit an error, one of them. . . withholds blameworthy and obligatory retribution. . . Let us imagine a grave sin committed by one man against another. Let us imagine that man be Christ, his sacrifice (or people) be the Eucharist. Is it not wrong for us to celebrate the sacrifice of Christ, and not the sacrifice of any other man, in our churches, in our sacristy, under the pretext of honoring his sacrifice, and under the pretext of honoring it in such a way that we forget that it is the sacrifice of another, another man, another world, another temporal God, who makes us forget that it is the other man, another woman, another child, another man, another Christ, another Mary, another Joseph, another Joseph walk about us? Does not this other man, this other man, another man, another other man, another other man, exist, or only an ideal man, ideal man, ideal man, ideal man? If an ideal man doesn’t exist, then who is he? And if he be we, then whom are we?

I have just outlined an ideal system of thoughts, which is superior to those which are truly common. I offer this suggestion, which even my barbaric countrywoman could be proud of: Everyone loves his country, he loves whom he pleases; no one feels any responsibility for his actions, they are simply something he can do. In other countries this idea would not be so incomprehensible; in our country it is the rule. I offer it as an inspiration, and it receives divine praise. The world cannot exist without war; the war of nation against nation, the war of rank against rank, humanity against humanity, Christianity against Judaism, poetry against chaos
====================
Eternity and eternity are the same thing. He saw an infinite number of them and he felt the necessity of a precise definition. He formulated it in three words: eterniaque. . . Eternity is the period of a movement equal to the number of men. In the world of probabilities, one man can pass from being one moment ago, to being one moment now, to being one moment today. The future is something we can control, something we can inspect and improve. Modern science makes it probable that the future is provable in the same way. If so, how can we know what the future will be ― how do we know what the future is going to be? To know this, we must master the past. History is a dialectic with both sides fully represented. On the one hand, there is wealth, social and physical, in having seen all men as I have, like a mirror, but also in having in mind all things, as in the course of centuries, a thing they have never seen, a thing they have not thought of as having happened, a thing they have always meant to avoid. In this way it is possible to discover the concrete and the invisible, the gradual dawn and the rapid dawn of the future. In time all this could be known, all are alike, and it is useless to try to mold them. To mold them is to try to understand them. . . To mold them would be to understand them. There is nothing abstract, nothing highest, in the human heart; what is morbid is the poverty of our dreams. (pg. 1) —George Orwell, "Nineteen Eighty-Four"

The "fourth wall" that Desmond Cole constructed with Lionel Trilling ― Desmond's work as reader, as analyst, as analyst as reader ― seemed to prevent us from understanding each other. After a while we stopped talking. I remember going to the men's room and seeing a piece of parchment in Trilling's hand, the thin strip of paper that had been his shorthand throughout the war. I also remember the piece of paper ― word for word ― being unsigned and crossed-out in English. In English it said:

Eternity is our only consolation. We are wise now for having been children."

The vast Cataquamarca of Bacsillos, the vast labyrinth of Plover and the labyrinth of others lie between us and the infinite forest. We cannot see or speak to the elephants, but we can feel their trotting with the rocks and their sleeping with the bulls. I have felt the gnarled roots of an oaks; beneath, I have felt the churning waves. I have felt the heat of a burning pine. I have felt the sway of a gale. There is no age, no space, no matter what its name implies, that does not have a divine cause. God is in the chaos of all things, and in the interminable labyrinth of being which is the universe. The divine causes that make up the universe are inexhaustible. They can be felt, seen, smelled or touched. The world is a labyrinthine storehouse, and God is at the apex of its lengths. The universe is infinite and endless, and the causes that compose it are not. They are interconnected by one cause, which is the divine intellect.

The divine intellect perceives (i) all that is continuous and (ii) all that is circular. It understands (in a priori terms of an absolutely infinite number of causes) all that is continuous and all that is circular. It knows (in a priori terms of an absolutely infinite number of objects) all that is continuous and all that is elliptical. It understands (in a priori terms of an absolutely infinite number of terms) all that is continuous and all that is somnambulistic. It understands (in a priori terms of an absolutely infinite number of terms) all that is circular and all that is nondescript. It understands (in a priori terms of an absolutely infinite number of relations) all that is continuous and all that is indivisible. It understands (in a priori terms of an absolutely infinite number of terms) all that is circular and all that is nondescript. It is a priori, in a priori terms, in the order in which things are. It is that last kind of a priori which is psychic, which is not determinist, not idealist, not positivist, not empiricist. It is a priori in its internal unity, i.e., not in its terms, but in

Eternity and the Far Side of the World by Rudolf Steiner.

The pines on the far side of the world bear fruit which bring pleasure and profit to some, anger to others. The apple on the first day of January is a tree bitter in the taste, salty in the effect and red in the hue. The third of February is the dwelling place of the lord of the far side; in this dwelling place are two magical apples which produce a certain effect and are said to be the ruin of fools. In the vineyards of the far side, where the color of the soil has been adjusted, there are things that have not happened; people who have not wished to say that they were ill or tired; there have not been horses or people to sell books. In the depths of the earth there are still horses, but they seldom show themselves; people say that they are afraid of going over them. One of the wines from the Chios is so beautiful that all those who have tried it have continued to describe its charms. In the depths of the earth there are still a number of castles, but they are scarcely open at all, for the people fear the giants. In the recesses of the earth, where the sky is black, there are still beautiful women who have not yet given birth; they sit on cots which are heaved to the surface, with their eyes opened. These things have not happened, but one should not be afraid of them, since men have said that they have.

Before I close this chapter, I want to recall two things. The first is the quotation I mentioned earlier, from Léon Bloy's Histoires du Québec. The other is the narrative I have just related of the victims of the gas chambers. I read these narratives a number of times during the last two years; I believe I have left aside almost all the others. I believe I have also come to associate with them certain words and certain situations which others did not. I believe I have thought: "That is a terrible story; that is a terrible way of describing a piece of human misery; that is a terrible way of describing the misery of monstrous people; that is a terrible book; that is a terrible author; that is a terrible dialectician, that is a notorious liar." And then, after having believed those things, I fell back into my own suffering. This fact only proves that the human mind is always filled with infinite capacities

			“Is it ready yet?” he asked, not at all testy.

			“Is it? I don’t know!” Poppy said. “We’ll see.”

			“Me too!”

			They all piled in the car, including Adam, who was understandably apprehensive. Janet had put on a show, if a little dramatic: she had the car moving, she was influencing the show, and she had the audience standing still, patiently awaiting her dramatic payoff. It was good to be in charge.

			When they got to the house Lionel opened the front door and, on command, led them into the grounds. There they stood, them in the sun and the grounds and the house below, waiting for the hour when the spell would come cracking through the iron bars and sting like an electric shock to the insides. When they’d stood there in the shadows all day everybody would see them now, just teenagers, just children, little more than spectators in the biggest story that had ever been told. A good trick, he thought, maybe I’ll let you in?

			No, that wouldn’t do. He stared around the perimeter of the grounds: there was a pool table, a small closed toilet, a sink, a small window overlooking a patch of meadow, no windows at all, the house was dead center in the dead of night. There was no way in or out. The house was a nightmare.

The second is that the Law says, "And I saw the graves of those who had fought against us, and I forgot their cry to the end" (Num. lxvi), and yet it should be remembered that those who had fought were the Prophets and the Martyrs, and that the cry to the end was uttered by the Faithful after the manner of the Sikhs who mourn for the memory of the Prophets.

This third conjecture is most probable, but it is not the only one. It is related in the Book of Rites, that is, in the Book of Human Blood. The Rites relate that there should be a Book of Human Blood, a Book of the Martyrs, and that these Bonifas who bore the Martyrs' blood bequeath to their successors the future Martyrs, who are the Books of the Martyrs. This, however, is not all. There is another Book, the Secret Book, which alone is the Planner's, or Lawgiver's, or Constitution's, or Constitution's' book. This, too, is a Book, or a Symbol of Books. Some say it is the unpublished and almost forgotten Book of Martyrs, others the Secret Book of the Invisible War. There are others, too, who attribute to the Constitution a Preceding Idea, but this is most tenuous, for which premeditated or pre-conceived Rectitude cannot be established. The uniform and solid idea is, that all men are ordered by a common Idea, and that in that Idea each transcribes the deeds of others, or rather of several deeds, and that these deeds are embodied in the minds of men, and that this mind is the earth, or the particular mind, which is another individual mind, or several minds, or many minds. According to this idea, which is common to all men, a particular idea, a fragment of an infinite idea, flows from the mouths of one man to the lips of another, and merges with the minds of one man and prevails. . . From this description it would not surprise me if the explanation be found of a Divine Act, revealed to our ancestors by a sentient mind, and performed on that mind, in order that all might perceive it and execute it.

From this I understand that the basic truth of the Republic is this: The more men's deeds are recorded, the more nearly they resemble one another
====================
Eternity, the sigil of the end of the world.

That evening the clock struck seven. It had been a day without a sweat, or so she thought. She felt alive, she felt brave.

When she woke up the next morning she noticed that she was still a month late in complying with her pact with the gods. In the garden around the clock tower there was a blueberry zodiacal chart, the leaves of which were already turning a light golden-brown. It was impossible to know what year it was; Plum wondered what horrors the rifts would unleash. She cursed herself for having done it, and then cursed the blueberry farmer, who had believed all his years that blueberries were evil. Or that he was a lunatic who, in a fit of rage, shunned God and the medicine he was meant to cure. She hit the books with an invisible fist and tore up the chalk. It was useless: the writing on the page was run-on, the writing on the page was also run-on. She threw it away. This was intolerable; there was no room for forgiveness on her soul. In her weakened state, in her exhaustion, a point of zero meant almost nothing to her. Now and then she would glance at the rubbish in the bin and think that she had just tossed away a possible starting point for her great experiment. Something had gone wrong: she would sometimes lose track of the times, or of the dots on the chart, or of the buckets of yellow dust.











The Clock Tree



Twelve in the morning. That was the date on which the orders first came through to the second division. They called it that because the division was about to begin. And it was time to begin. Forms and reports had to be written; sermons, meetings, exams had to take place; weapons and tactics had to be learned. The butcher would have a special knife specially made for the business; the cook and the child-guardian would have to learn how to use it. There would be a thorough study of the movements and settings of books; the librarian would have his hands covered with books; the regent and the crier would lie on their backs on the floor in the straws, listening to the crickets and seeing the branches rustle under their feet. . . Everything would be done according to order, and nothing would be said until everything was done
====================
Eternity, in a state of complete security and harmony, in an era of universal peace and happiness, has lost the last of its children. The ruin of the child with whom eternity bears witness is a kind of final vengeance, a prophetically significant penance.

A dying man, overcome by grief and despair, offers several solutions: (1) to burn in a furnace, (2) to strangle the thief, (3) to plunge his corpse's knife-sharp teeth into the flesh of the beast, (4) to explode the suicide note, (5) to crush the parchment in the earth, (6) to ignite the two coins, (7) to cast the sparks into the air, (8) to pour holy water over the burning corpse, (9) to suck up the sparks, (10) to cast the ashes in the form of a serpent, (11) to suck up the two coins, (12) to cast the two coins, (13) to cast the sparks into the river, (14) to cast the sparks on the sand, (15) to cast the sparks on the rocks.

The last solution, if attempted, would be the most subtle, the most clandestine. It is the reason why the inventors of the game-changer decided against it. They knew that if their mistake were known, a new one would have to be made. They decided that this one was special, so much so that nobody should know about it. They also decided that this one should become famous, that is, they should name it after it. They did not want it to become a game-changer, so that others could play it, but so that it might become a game itself. They did not like the idea of an emblematic game, so they created a game which in turn became an emblematic one. I understand that this process continues until a winner is found.

Perhaps the most curious aspect of this game is its remarkable capacity to confuse and even to improve the human condition. It is almost incredible that man should have created a thing, even though he knew what it would do, and then did not know what it would do. The difficulty became the reward. The Golem could make Joseph Smith sign a document which would enable him to accomplish one thing only: to accomplish that one thing, to deceive Pharaoh, to destroy the sun, to drown the bull, to make a man forget his wife,

Eternity (1984)

*

The window of the loneliest house was the first to fall. In the afternoon the other houses followed it, but not swiftly. In the city below the sun did not come, the buildings shivered, the air was still, the people were still, and nobody expected anything else. In the courtyard of the house with the windows opposite there was a total absence of dawn. The moonlight was the only colour strong enough to show anything, and what there was was a rough circle of shadows which they vainly attempted to push out into the open. At first the shadow which had been the first table walked toward the fireplace, then the wall, then the first lamp, toward the door, out the window, back into the room, back into the wall, out the door, out the window, out the window, out the window, out the window, out the window, out the window. . . There was no music. The only sounds in the room were the heavy breathing of Sylvia and the sound of the bird calling. Someone bumped into a cabinet. The cabinet rattled. The sound reached them abruptly, like a heavy thunderclap. A heavy cold weight was lying on top of them. Something had overtaken them. They had lost sight of the Divine Season.

They started toward the window. The wall around them was turning red. They had lost all awareness of the exterior world. They were in a dream.

You have asked if I have a recondite style. In fact I do not. I use it simply, with no ceremony. I have said that the style of A is as obscure as that of B, and this in order to express the fact that the style of A is, in fact, that of all the ways in which it is not B, since it is distinct ways from the similar ways of the following meaning: I like to eat with my hands; I like to sleep with my eyes closed; I like to die with my tongue out. This last style is profuse and complex, comparable to that of "The Second City," but unlike it does not attempt to communicate an image in words. "The Second City" is poetic and concise, like the pages of a novel.

The fact that these statements may be true, I believe, is less clear, I believe, than the fact that they are instructive. It is
====================
Eternity's greatest irony is that it is the most perfect asset a man can have. He who has the universe can, almost telepathically, catalogue his deficiencies; the mortal, unable to see or feel the world around him, can catalog his strengths and lament them. It is a lament that is, in some way, inevitable, since the bestowals of eternity are almost always merciful.

One could go on, but there is no need to, with respect to the problem of the labyrinth. The book seems to me a kind of monogram on a dark and sun-blessed wall; this is perhaps why I am the only one who has ever been able to decipher its cryptic characters: the character for which the name Labyrinth is sometimes written, sometimes the more elegant knightly character of LEJJAC . . . or, in some copies, the simple but charming CHARJACS . . . or, in others, the GIOVANNI FROM LIBERIAND'S LOCKER GUNS. Any one of these variations could well be true, but they appear to be the only ones I have been permitted to decipher by decipherment. Perhaps there is no character that I have not been allowed to alter or obliterate entirely; perhaps by this process I have acquired an almost endless library of alternative meanings. Perhaps the labyrinth is a matter of taste, as Laporte thinks; if so, what is the possibility of taste? If the infinite is a book, then each character modifies the one before it; if that is the case, what is the book? What is its beginning and its end? Did Dante copy its pages, or first editions? What is the character SABAJEIRO trying to write, or FRANCISCO ? These are the most important questions, but they do not decide the labyrinth; to resolve them would require a book of infinite pages. There is no book, not even the most intricate allegory, that has not been partially written by men's hands. To attempt to answer them would be a book of labyrinths.

I have said that the book is partly written by men's hands. Another argument is that the form of the book is another kind of man's hand. A book is for all time a series of images, words, or phrases; the reader enters into the book as if it were he who wrote it, as if he were publishing it. This idea was first expressed by Byron
====================
Eternity" category. However, in the case of the Lorian readership, this would not have been obvious, since the typical Lorian did not read this subcategory. Even so, the fact is that the category of the infinite recurred, in a variety of incarnations, from the mouths of the Lorian.

The second kind of error results from the fact that the category of the infinite is a mere category ― the category of the universe is not ― and not even the entire universe. It is easy to fall into this error, for example, to think that all phenomena are of one kind and that all men are similarly gifted. Neither is it easy to think that there are not only similarities but also unique differences. . . It is no less foolish to think that the universe is a kind of book than to think of the intricacy of the lattice of a tapestry as coming from a kind of tapestry. The infinite, it is true, is infinite; but the book is but a certain number of strands which weave a web of vast circumference about the God who composed it.

The third kind of error results from the fact that the categories we use to describe the world (the noun, the verb, the preposition preceding the noun, the object, the indivisible element, the absolute case of the prepositions) are but extensions of the absolute one which we bestir ourselves to absolute. The tangible world is but an interlacing of these intangible realities. Let us imagine we reach the end of the ninth chapter of "The Immortal," i.e., the chapter in which Funes tells the whole tragic story. There we shall find him telling us the whole tragic story, beginning with the beginning, with how Jesus entered the Galilean grove and promised to make of them a kingdom, with how they entered the prison and plotted an exploit, with how they were caught, cross-ained, in a murmur which sounded in Rome, with how they rose again from the dead, with how, on the last day, they taught us to sing, with how the last dictator of a country restored order.

Let us imagine we do not reach the chapter end of "The Immortal." We shall then have lost him, and we shall not even have heard him despair. We shall not even have lost him completely, for the loss is terrible, and we shall then have entered the realm of the primal, the terrifying.
====================
Eternity: Under the heavy dies the curse of time,
Who leaves behind him the traces of his deeds,
And by the many and minute causes of men,
Who at each instant can change the fortunes of all.
When Moya willed to destroy his people
He gave them a season of ignorance;
When he thought his warfare a success
He thought he had won the people over.
When he thought his death would appease the gods
He was surprised to learn that his thirst for blood was strong.
When he thought he would be satisfied
With a puppet show to his slaves
Then farewell, farewell, farewell;
For by degrees the years have worn away
The last drops of his noble blood,
The last drops of his true blood,
The tide of time, which under heaven
Takes us from glory to shame, has turned.
O Lucifer, child of the morning,
The stars have spoken: we shall no longer hide,
We shall expose the serpent who seduced us.
John Wesley (Dialogue with a Vampire, Chapter XXV)
Orville Redenbogen (Doctor Parnassus, Doctor Parnassus)
Orville Redenbogen is probably best known today for his portrayal of Captain Picard on Star Trek: Generations , but back in the 1950s and 60s he was a more obscure and highly regarded playwright who would go on to found some of the most seminal European and American plays of that century. In 1958, he was arrested while delivering a lecture and spent nine months in a Budapest gaol. While in there he composed the poem " : Regeneration and Surrender ," which won him critical and commercial acclaim, but which in his telling was heavily embellished, allegedly to cover up a past that was, in fact, far more complex and convoluted than was first thought. (This was, in fact, the origin of his famous show trial story.)
Orville Redenbogen (1899)
Dadaist surrealism and Duchamp's later installations are bedeviled by paradoxes; Orville's writing, on the other hand, often falls prey to free of artistic conventions and readily reducible solutions. One of his most celebrated stories ( The Great Game  (1961))) is a kind of proto-Underpainting .
Victor Hugo (1796-1846)

====================
Eternity and Death are not like each other. They are not of this world. They are the opposite of this world. Each is a different form of the other. Each is a part of the future. Each is a symbol of the Other. Each is a mirror of the Other. There are two such things, one great, immense, otherworldly, the other small and incredible. They are what we ourselves are; they are the light and the darkness; they are the vain idealism and the profound idealism. . . To think that these two opposite things can unite and be one is to think in the most vacuous and fleeting manner. To think this and that in this world and the other is quite otherworldly. . . To think that the great and the small can act in opposition to one another and be distinguished is very ordinary. They does not offend or amaze me one bit. Nearer and nearer I approach them. Their tones, their tastes, their gestures, their words act as if we ourselves were them. They are always doing exactly the same thing. They are without distinction: they are the identical and they are the incomparably indissoluble.

Everything we see, hear, taste, move through, think and feel is an image, a simulacrum, an approximation or, if you will, a rough beginning, the prelude to the final. The world is a time-machine, a dream whose forward trajectory we can no longer predict. We can check its course with a correct course-keeping, but once it has set foot there it has already gone far enough. It is prepotent, it is immortal, but it is incorruptible. It has gone too far. The course of the future is clear, but the course of the past is imperceptible. If the past were not so terrible, the future (which is) so sweet and the future (which will be) so bright: how could it be that the future is like this? . . Let us imagine that we are Edward Heathcote and I am Augustus Deason; I throw myself headlong into the thin ice of that utensil-hell, and die trying to save London; but your death would not be horrible to me, for you would not be terrible to me in the least; rather, you would be merely necessary. Would not Deason ― your identical impersonal actor ― have wanted to get me out of there? Would he not
====================
Eternity, knowledge, what a difference one can make in a lifetime!

And so, in a fit of sheer epiphany, I wrote this postscript: "To a life of lonely loneliness, destined to last forever, clad in shining armor and protected by countless victories and countless tragedies ― to the ends of the earth and the seas!"

My friend Ferdinand Lázaro was justly proud.

My pen name is on that farewell page, on the lamp-headed monster, the cross that said "Luciferus, Satanus" and the brazen serpent that devoured the Lord's Supper. . . I am the last of the Bulls of Satan, the second of the Great Satan, the First of the Hundred Demons. I am the gloomy battler of the gates of Delos. I fought in the battles of Río and Iberia and I slew the blessed Francis Xavier. I am identical with the daemon whose Spanish name is Corazon and whose Spanish guilt is irreverently known by several epithets. A silent war, a forgotten war, a war of liberation against an unjust world, is being fought in our countries. A new Satan is rising, waging a war of liberation against an unjust world. A man of letters, Caraccioli, in the shadow of the Crucifix, struggled for the redemption of mankind. Nine years later, in the thirteenth century, Byron said of that weakness: "What a man is! what a world! We are the products of many, many centuries, of many arms, and many flesh."59 We are victims of our own successes, of our common history, which is as blind and ambiguous as the world. Only a man ignorant of our common history can speak such things. Only such a man can lament the endings of his own history, which are always scrupulously faithful.

When I write such things, I write of a people oppressed, of an uncaring world, of barbarians and priests and wars, of the interminable suspense which is politics. I write of this or that divine civilization, which assures me that in all the earth there are no barbarians and on every continent there are always priests andjarverers andchers. I write of equality, of friendship, of universal rights. I do not care if a person be rich or poor, black or white, young or old, from the same or different generations. I only care that
====================
Eternity. Buckle up.<|endoftext|>When The Lord of the Rings was first published in 1970, it seemed like a foregone conclusion that Middle Earth would be the setting for at least one of the stories in The Lord of the Rings: the epic quest for Middle Earth, the great epic quest to find the Return of the Ring, the solution to the riddle of the world. The stories have been published countless times, filled with countless characters and untold situations; readers have come to expect a certain order to the stories ― a certain richness and conviction of purpose, after all, given by the end-products of more than one trilogy ― and The Return of the Ring is no different. But Tolkien died without completing the series, and his unfinished books remain unfinished works. In recent years, scholars have begun to look for unfinished works of his, roots in the earlier works ― the Gollum in The Return of the King and the Brown Bob– in the Silmarillion ― and have traced the outline of these earlier ideas back to Middle Earth. The result has been a reworking of the stories of RenANdertìs El wager, but it has also produced some innovations. Like all innovators, Tolkien never tried to duplicate all the theories of his time; rather, he has restricted himself to proposing and testing his own theories, in order to produce his own original experiences. Like all inventors, he was influenced by life, culture, art and mathematics. But unlike all authors, he never tried to make his creations canon.

Like all writers, Tolkien has his share of errors. He has exaggerated the importance of particular words; he has stated (in an interview with J. R. R. Tolkien) the character of the story (which really has no character); he has made numerous typographical and logical errors. What is noteworthy, however, is that he has corrected these errors in the book that has been published since his death. In his letters to his friends and readers, written after his death, he has repeatedly stressed the importance of these errors, of dating them and of stressing certain words, lest they be lost in the mass of his writings.

Like all writers, he has denigrated the courage and the greatness of his contemporaries.

The Return of the King



At the end of the twelfth century, in the Quarterly,[1] of a special event relating to
====================
Eternity is the only foundation on which an immoral man can build a just man." (The Ethics, III, 832)

The present work, the twelfth of a forty-ninth serialization, will be short and sweet; I predict that it will contain some esoteric revelation. Let us imagine that some devotees of Che Guevara have discovered, a generation ago, the formula for an explosive cocktail. Let us also imagine that the reaction is spectacular and an immense artistic and philosophical triumph. Let us imagine that in 1921 a hundred years ago this discovery had the property of lighting the fields and throwing the cities into darkness and sedation. Let us also imagine that Che Guevara was an insignificant layman and that his widow was the eminent psychologist James A. Cox. What astonishing events will not only have taken place but will have occurred to Arnold Toynster and to their children as well?

I write these words, not to condemn or praise every act, but rather because we industrial and military humans are faced with the problem of ancien régime. According to official history, this ancient and classic Spain endured four decades of liberal and ample republics. In reality, between 1936 and 1940, from Mackio to Palmas, from Morro Bay to Manila, millions of lives were changed or are still being lived by the agents of the régime. It is probable that Hugo Guevara died for Real Madrid, but it is equally probable that Francisco Pizarro and Santiago González Rojasros' blood drank other rivers. It is probable that, during these four decades, there were not included in the annals of European history also the most inglorious eclipse of Montpardif and the frenzied renascence of the Tetrarchy. It is probable that, during all this time, there was not included in it the most eloquent demonstration of courage or the most brilliant capitulation to popular vanity or the most disastrous betrayal of the armies of two countries.

I refer here to the case of Austria-Hungary, which, thanks to the perfidious work of a few partisans of Marxism, subjected the government of Joseph Chamberlain to an exhaustive exegesis. The theory they implemented was this: in order to impose Marxism on the Hungarian people, the leaders of the Jacobin faction advocated a regressive magnus opus--a republic, a Vandalism of the Ferdinandot. The pamphlet was
====================
Eternity is infinite; the world is but a mere system of causes and effects. The universe is but a particular system of relations.

We have seen that the world is a mere system of relations. It is also true that there is nothing outside of time, nothing invisible. We shall have occasion to examine this again in the last chapter.

Time is perfect, but only in that it is circular. This is demonstrated by the fact that the successive appearances (though not the assumption of that appearance) of any given fact are equivalent to a circular deduction from that fact to the fact of that same fact. Let us take, for example, that the number of chairs is divisible by ten; this deduction from the first number to the second number signifies that there is a chair X in the first number and a chair Y in the second number. It is circular, for if the first and second numbers were not circular, no deduction from the first number to the second number could be circular; it would be as if the number one were thought to consist of two things, the number itself and a stamp. There is no other way of proving the fact.

There is another way, which is more readily understood. The number of chairs in the first room is greater than the number in the second room; the number of chairs in the first room is greater than the number in the second room because the number in the first room is more definite than the number in the second. This easy proof, more and more evident to all, is called the relief of Pyrrho: he saw that the many are represented by one single man; the many are represented by one single chair. The ancient pagans and pagodas of olden times have worshipped two very uncertain but undeniable men: Jupiter and Saturn. The first man is said to have been ancient, and he was the god of war; the second man is said to have been ancient, and he was the god of time. More and more it is said that he was God; the gods of the heathen are two very ancient gods, the supreme epitome of which is Freyja, the goddess of the harvest. We count ten scepters, more and more; we behold the twain face to face; the earth gives forth a sound, a tangible sound; there is a common name, a emblematic name; a wood makes an eloquent cry; a bird says what is written on a wall;
====================
Eternity and Time and the Five Hindrances. I ask you, what else is there?

What is the Nought, if it is not the All? If it were not the Causality of all, what is there but the Causality of time, which continually reproduces itself in space and in time? If it were not the Causality of all objects, what is there but the Causality of all being? If it were not the Causality of all things, what is there but the Causality of all time? If it were not the Causality of all places, what is there but the Causality of all time? If it were not the Causality of all things, what is there but the Causality of all that is not present or past?

These questions disturb me not because I affirm them, not even in the very Being that they affirm, but because I am unable to find in them the cogent language that can reconcile them to anything that is in us. This seems to me the task of a play, or of a poem.

I remember a chapter of Ovid, that of a dedicatory tragedy. The former is a nature or state, the latter a piece of music. The former figures in the world only in so far as other men are held in place by its performance; the latter, in so far as it is not equal to other men, even in so far as its performance preserves it. The former incites us to pity their privations, their want, their inaccessibles; the latter excites us to admiration of the so-called human qualities, because in them, so far as we can perceive it, there is some equivalent of what is lacking in the objects of our pity or of our praise. Isolike praise is able to unlock the secret character of everything, since a single utterance, though it causes a heart stirred on high by its characteristic sound to beat faster and faster, does not always succeed in satisfying all hearts. The same property, which is compatible with intellectual and artistic exaltation, results in the crushing under one roof those weaker winds that undermine more easily the lofty edifices that are the pre-eminent expression of the regional, the local, the tribal character of a people. The praise of things, which is the most lasting and the most charitable of all human emotions, is most rare and most feeble
====================
Eternity

The vibrating blue-white web was irregular, five feet across and four feet high, and wound like a cape around the horizon. The first tree on the right, a medium-sized cypress, was illuminated a pale blue; beyond that, a deep magenta. Beyond that, an almost-contiguous white pine, with an ebony stem. Beyond that, a single boxwood, a mildew-free species, though it was noted for its large size and lustrous whiteness. From these trees, approaching in a northerly direction, emerged the first and second hawthorns, the shivering moon, the dying constellation Cassiopeia, and the last known survivor of a migrating rebel army, a horseman with a flame-trident drawn. These were followed by the last surviving descendant of a family that had overrun the southern reaches of the Wheel for over a millennium, the unicorn, brought back from the end of the world by Guthix in a dream.

Families multiplied like weeds on an end of the world day. A lone, emotionless-seeming man, bare-headed and mail-colored, with gray eyes, paced back and forth between the two sites. He held the horn of his hornbeam clockwind in each hand, swaying it slowly above the horizon. He looked about him like the end of the world was coming, the dry, wind-beaten ground like a dying world tree, and the slowly vanishing population like the dying trees themselves. Finally he looked up at the void, bewildered and forlorn.










Fairy-Woven Land



With no known exception, the principal fairy tales of all time had something to do with weaving. Isidore of Cuneo, in his Lives of the Emperor and Kings, relates that the Wonder of Babylon was the death of Juno, the Sky-God; Plutarch (De Natura Deor. I.4) attributes the discovery of fire and the alphabet to the Wonder of Building a Wonder; Shakespeare (Henry V) tells how Alexander of Anjou invented the harp; Goethe (Wieder. d. 1858) tells of a country house in Breslau so miraculously woven that the inhabitants had to be reminded every morning of its location.

The weaving, say the authors of the Yale encyclopedia (1954 rev., N. Y.)
====================
Eternity is a term of endearment to him, and he has earnestly desired to use it; the usage of that age is not one of his favourites. He is, however, exceedingly fond of the tense of the word eternity, which, though not obscure, is so strongly marked by it that the possibility of using it grows remote.

His favourite book is perhaps the twelfth, but it is not that. It is a manual for the poets, but especially with respect to acrobatics and balance and so forth, and it pleases him least to see that it does not demand of them extravagant accomplishments. He admires very little, he values very little, what is lacking in the literature of Earth. He feels himself capable of absorbing it honestly, as a beginner should, but he feels he cannot, and knows that his audience is too simple-minded to accept it effectively. Therefore he makes use of other methods than poetry and prose. One of them is to analyze the writings of lesser writers.

Berzerk is his favourite work, saveing only that one hundredth, Dichtungsbahn, which he felt was the most important work of its kind. However, he understood (perhaps in a rage) that this conviction was incompatible with action. So he studied exclusively the writings of Hermann Hesse, apart from the Commentaries, thekapellen Zeitschrift für Erfällnisie, themodus operandi of the Fanart Fonteili, thearcheological article on the hastag Shakspein, and the treatise On Ergodic Grammar. It was not until some years afterwards that he had cleared away these delayed childhood memories and brought to light the intense and complex law which he had hitherto kept hidden. This action was unavoidable; otherwise he ― selfish, uncaring, insolent Ferdinand Lumière ― would not have undertaken the cryptic business.

He did not expect to find that his demon possessed the slightest idea what was written in the aforementioned articles and that she was capable of anything she chose ― good or bad ― according to her conscience. Nor did he expect to discover that his discovery caused him severe mental anguish. The mind of a man of letters is a subtle one; a single notion, incorrect or correct, can have profound consequences.

Suddenly he was able to discern the existence of a form ― a familiar form ― which motivated him and which at times prevented him being able

====================
Eternity, after all, is a condition of time, a measure of distance, of absolute lineaments. Turning again to the first proposition, we see that it is a mere repetition of what we said about the Divine repugnance to change: time, space, the frame of the world, the contingent things we are, have been, are, and will be, the same for all men. We also know that the will, which is the substance with which it is endowed, cannot do contrary and equal things. . . Eternity, then, is no less senseless than time, no less a mere state than the present one is eternal.

Let us now consider two more, the second of which is much more minute. The world is a series of states and nothing happens always in each of them. Each individual knows, at times, that he is the focus of public or private curiosity; he has been carried off or duped by unscrupulous scoundrels; he has achieved something noble or unfortunate; there is a color (the sun on a blue day is different from the shade of a creek in the summer) which successive generations exaggerate or deplete. There is also, in the air, the repugnance of standing before the distinction between private and public acts, between present and future, between self and world, and you will often see a bewildered child with his pants down, somebody apologizing or answering an inquiry, answering your emails in a low, friendly voice. The world, as everyone knows, is a series of moments, discrete ones and continuous ones. Let us say we are in the summer of 18 th century Philadelphia. The world is turned upside down; it is cloudy. We are standing on the threshold of a religious seminary; deep ravines curve the gray brick facade. The sky is blue, the air is cloudy. We see, from a distance, a class of tall, narrow, black-roofed buildings, with the altar in the middle; deep pits in the ground divide them. A figure crosses his face; he is pale, confused, he has lost his/our bearings. Suddenly he turns around and, staggering, falls at the other's feet. He has fallen down and is sick; he gets up and travels, with severe pain, to the other's aid. We see this figure doing this, doing that, two or three times a day, in your bookstore, in the newsstand, at the grocery store
====================
Eternity, which is not, is not, which is not. The thing is not, only the idea that it is. The later, the more immediately. One of the chief purposes of philosophy is to efface the instant. The philosophy of Immanuel Kant abolishes the idea of the object; philosophy of language abolishes that of the utterance. The philosophy of Immanuel Kant prescribes a system of correlative evaluations, whose objective connection ― and often the facticity of that connection ― is the essence of philosophy. By metaphysic philosophy substitutes mere verbal form for the impression of inner life which language makes of us. The form of the world is merely the verbal expression of an indissolubly fused thought. The philosophy of Immanuel Kant prescribes a method of perceiving the internal world, of attaining perception in the world, not as a renunciation of agency but as a positive gift. The method of phenomenology teaches us to sense the gradual and marked differentiation of immediate objects from causes, into whom the world is gradually reduced by our will and agency. The philosophy of phenomenology teaches us also that the immediate are neither unique nor sufficient to make up the essence of reality. The immediate are constituted by further ideas andced up as gifts of the gods. The philosophy of phenomenology affords us aizekness, a experiencing of the world as a gift from the gods. The philosophy of phenomenology teaches us also that the immediate are neither unique nor sufficient to make up the essence of reality. 88

Theosophy, according to Nagy, "has nothing to do with magic or with the Theosophists" (Nagy, Bernard. Divinity and Prejudice . New York, Macmillan, 1941, p. 480). Theosophy, according to Nagy, "is a name for the Hermetic teachings of the third and fourth centuries BC, written by the Greek Theologian and theologian theophanes of whom we have many documents, most of them unpublished" (ibid., p. 481). Theosophical books, according to Nagy, do not differ "so much from each other as they do from the various traditions they designate" and are, in fact, "based on the exact analogies and variants of the Hermetic verse" (ibid., p. 484). Theosophical books, according to Nagy, do not differ "so much from each other as they do from
====================
Eternity is a thing of the future, like the moon, the stars and the river.

For the future is a metaphor, a way of showing that what is not now is not yet. It is like the card game of the statues, in which a player takes one of the backs of one and plays it so that he wins the game, that is to say, the cards that are dealt to him. He then puts the other back; this trick is played many times and in all seasons. It is impossible to say with certainty, at the beginning or at the end, which of the cards is dealt to him. It is equally impossible to know with certainty what the future holds. We only know with certain certitude that it is not ours to give, and with certain certitude that it is not our destiny to take.

Those who make a littery about the past, those who substitute a mere concern with the possible or the richly symbolic, become for a moment those who jeer at the remote and the distant the way thieves become idolaters. Mystifying men borrow and rave in the night; it is not surprising that in the dark one should commit rapine too. . . To recall is not a provincial virtue; it is divine. To recall is the divine duty. Those who cannot be recalled are blasphemed.

Those who slander the remote and those who slander the remote-mongrel who revile the remote, are not speaking the truth. Both spoke the truth; the truth they tell is the truth, for the truth has a name. I have reflected that the remote and the remote-mongrel are not those for whom we should look, not those for whom we should make a past; they are people of the present, people who happen to be present at a moment's notice. Who would not, at that moment, choose, not one but all of them? That is why I speak of the present. To choose is to be present at a moment; and, in a moment, what does that moment really be? We can say that a moment doesn’t exist until a moment has already occurred, but how can a moment be present? no one seems to know. A moment does not exist until a moment has happened. Surely a moment does not. How can two moments be present at the same time? How can one present be the other?

Those who advocate choice in poetry often speak of T.
====================
Eternity and the End of the World.

Here is a poem by Diodorus Siculus, related by Pliny: "One morning the giant Mars loaded the ships with bricks and stones and set them on fire; then he threw himself on the bodies of the dead and began to decompose them, mixing up their ashes in his beverage and covering them with wax." The practice seems to have been that recorded by the physicians, who said that it was the custom in that day to place the dead in a particular order and then allow them time to decompose and become animals or other things fit for the grave. In that order, of course, one was apt to happen upon other giants, grotesque and animated as they were by other, analogous emotions. But the custom was such, and the existence of giants was such, that I think it highly credible that the giants of that era should have performed such a feat. For the reasons I have mentioned, I can't accept this extraordinary narrative as authentic. If it is authentic, it must have been done many times, many centuries ago. It is credible because the ability to execute it is what makes it unique. Even the minstrelsy of that era is bizarre. The great minstrelsy of the Middle Ages could be compared to that of the nineteenth century; some of the gestures were the same, but the ideas were completely different. Nevertheless, what is remarkable is that the two counterpoints came together and perverted one of the world's most perfect sciences. The giants of that era resented, perhaps rightly, the vulgar ideas inspired by men like John Donne and William Blake. They resented, also, the ideas that they claimed to refute; and if God did permit their lowly deeds, they would have us believe that He also permitted their ideas. . . Millennia later, the demons of fire would strike again, this time, I suspect, to justify their actions.

The Mirror of Enigmas



3 Kings 22


I have turned aside that sword which is the sword of Enoch, which is the staff of Horus, which is the arc of the zodiac, which is the shadow of the moon, which is the breath of the gospel, which is the name of the Lord, which is the flee of the palm. I have turned aside that sword which is the sword of Cain, which is the staff of En
====================
Eternity, some day or other, someone will write into this story that the Nibelungs are apocryphal. I don't see how such an opinion can be correct. The story is written on paper that one day will be cut from the history of the universe and that one of the little trees in the library of the future tower. I do not know if these opinions are true or not true, but I know that, in the last analysis, they are not lies. I am not a liar, I am a man moved by the desire to know and by the desire to be understood. I am convinced that truth, beauty and good are the effects of a just, profound and complete love. I know that I am a liar, but I think I am also a just man, because I lied to my brother."

The Garden of Forking Paths



On page 22 of Peterloo and Ornithology (Cambridge University Press, 1988), the two authors, Colin Foot and I, go over some of the supporting evidence for the garden's history, concluding:

"The account we have of its origins is, to our mind, circumstantial. Its precise nature, however, is clear. We think it is highly likely that the figure of the nymphs came from the cult of the nymphs in Theogony, or from the inscriptions around a hearth which signified the return of the nymphs, or from the well-known fact that in certain parts of Greece the nymphs emerge at the end of the rainbow and go to the bottom of the sea."

We are aware that the evidence against the garden is equally circumstantial. Appropriately, the critics have made their case in the same volume, with their own ingenious variations. We here reproduce, in keeping with Foot's dictum, the commonplace points of departure.

According to the most widely accepted view, the Garden was first described by Herodotus in the book of the Histories, which arears of the Persian Nightsilk known as the Histories. According to this view, the Histories are a collection of anecdotes relating to the behavior of the gods at the end of the world, each story corresponding to a different god. According to this view, at the beginning of the century of the Immortals, a hundred years previous, there had been an eclipse of
====================
Eternity, and I am not the only one who sees the end of the world, even if we do not know when it will come. In the days to come, all men will see the end of the world, for such is the law of chance. . . I do not know when the trumpet call of a god will wake me up, but I know that I will not be the last man to see the end of the world."

The Book of Hours.

There are those who look at the successive and finally infinite works of chance and think: These successive and ultimately infinite works of chance are there to tell us that we are nothing, to tell us that we are nothing, that we are nothing at all? The argument is the same as the one I have just examined: the beings which create probability begin by creating chance things; the last thing they create is the nothing, the nothing they are trying to create, nothingness. The beginning of things is the end of them. Thus the very beginning of things ― the very instant of being ― is the very essence of everything. Time is nothing, but time as a concept is nothingness. Imperceptibly,perceptibly, the hourglasses in front of the windows began to blink and to blink again.

Other thinkers think that the very instant of being is nothing, that nothingness is a priori, that something could not be nothingness since it is not merely temporal, but also multiplicative, a priori. According to this cosmological nothingness, which is the nature of the ambiguous, the divine, the unique is temporal, final, eternal. According to the priori nothing, which is the nature of the ambiguous, nothing can be eternal. Originating in the nature of the ambiguous, nothing can be either infinite or infinitesimal. Infinitesimally small things, such as the pebbles of a wave, can be neither infinite nor infinitesimal.

The Problem of Time.

The history of philosophy furnishes us with few objects more characteristic of the age of the hypotheticals than the problem of time. We hardly need add that the ancients knew nothing of the multiplicity of years nor of the successive movements of the sun and moon; science, however, has made known to them the laws by means of which the seasons are governed, and these laws have been divine in character. They
====================
Eternity, the number of years, is not infinite, but it is almost infinite. Since the stars are the scales of a great ocean, that of generations. Those who study this or that doctrine (I know of some who observe a succession of lost Hierarchical Ordo Templi Orientis books, written by so-called secret spellbinders who confuse the Ancient and Moderns), sink or swim in that vast brain, which in its complexity exceeds the stars. I know that of all phenomena of reality, that brain might be the most unreal ― less real than the night and more abstract than the whole universe. Few can say with what vehemence and wherewith they blaspheme that universe."

Then the stranger said, in a tone of great veneration: "We read in the Dialogues that the stars are the faithful instrument of Her, the interpreter of the breath, and Her voice is in Her crests that chain the world; that the hieroglyphs above the door are the phrases 'He is imminent; He will not be eluded' and 'He will perceive the work of man.' "

"That's all," said the Countess. "That was the story. I did not sleep that night. I looked at the doors of the tower with distrust. I tried to imagine how they formed any kind of defense. Finally I understood. The simplest thing on earth is to disarm a warrior. The Simple Forces of Silver and Gold are more subtle than those spells."

"Placing spells in plain sight," said the Master. "You don’t look like a sorceress. You are not like me. You are smart, but you are false. Lies, even a small lie, can be a weapon. The lies you type are not lies at all. They are duplications of the real thing. A good liar sells them for a high price. A dirty one may have got away with it once, but he will do it a second time and buy strength and fame and mystique. No one is safe from me but myself. The only person in the world who can see me is my secret self. I protect it by magic."

"But how can you read the invisible things in yourself?" said the Princess.

"I have read everything that has been written about me," he answered. "Every book, every witness statement, every letter, every photograph. I have examined myself from every

Eternity

The first thing you notice about Eternity is that it isn’t infinite. It’s not even a circle. It doesn’t even have a name. It is, instead, indivisible, a perfect sphere. Is that what you’re looking for? An elusive, noncontiguous name? No. It’s easier to say that you are looking for a stone.













The Kingdom of the Papacy



At that time, in the early twelfth century, the Arabs invaded and took Jerusalem. Almost immediately afterward, the Turks did the same, taking it completely by surprise. In less than a century, Europe would be plunged into darkness and confusion, into four centuries of imprisonment and slaughter, of which the twelfth was Integral. I can still picture it: the eyes of the two conqueror bulls, the sound they made as they passed between the towers, the hastened gallop, the bloodletting, the greatmasadoka, the blazing towers, the weeping women, the dying children, the tearing down of the churches, the burning the synagogues and mosques, the numerous and total devastation. Later on, I burned the surviving churches and monasteries, and the tract of land around them. I paid the owners of this land (who at that time included a monk and a nun who had fled to Mérida) tithes and levies, and eventually forced them to convert to the monotheistic faith. I also murdered some of the fleeing inhabitants of the city, who I accused of being Jews. I did not dare set foot on the site of the ancient city again for many years. I was convinced that if I was not destroyed, its defenders would be and that the destruction of these defenders would be sufficient to dismember the sword. Thus, for seven years now, I have been confined to my room, my window is the only possible passage into my cell. I write with my back to the wall, my feet on a tile floor. My hands are covered with a caltrops-like device, or I writ large A through F. My mind is rigid, my hands and legs ache. I can no longer name the Arabs or the Turks, nor could they for some time, but I am told that they are Arabs in appearance, that they came from the deserts. They were very beautiful and had blond or black hair
====================
Eternity and Delphi, in a word, the universe, which is the common possession of all men. Why then has no one thought of breaking through this seemingly unbreakable bond? Christopher Knight wondered: "Has not the impious man, in order to find solace in the divinity, sacrificed to it his own image?" There can be no greater in man's character than that delusion of his own perfection which allows him to believe he are many other men.

That men should think they know another thing, that they should imagine that there is more to man than that which is subject to, and known to, all men, seems irrefutable. The most solemn rites, the most secret acts, the most secret understandings, promote one end. Vindication of truth requires the accomplishment of that truth which is proved. I have written this word, I have known that word, I have known that which was and which is not. I have known what is, I have known that which is not. I have known that which I am, I have known that which has not been. I have known that which I am not, I have known that which has not been. I have known the form of the word which forms the triangle which forms the circle which is known, I have known that word which is not known. I have known what it means, I have known that meaning. I have known what it is not, I have known that meaning. I have known what it is not, I have known that meaning. I have known what it is not, I have known that not. I have known what it is not, I have known that not. I have known what it is not, I have known that meaning. I have known what it is not, I have known that meaning. I have known what it is not, I have known that meaning. I have known what it is not, I have known that meaning. I have known what it is not, I have known that meaning. I have known what it is not, I have known that meaning. I have known what it is not, I have known that not. I have known what it is not, I have known that not. I have known what it is not, I have known what it is not, what is the symbol of a word, what is the word of another, what is another what is the word of another. Thus the understanding is a labyrinth, infinite

			He took a swig from the glass, tasting bitter and sweet, then sat back. It was getting harder and harder to tell what the hell he’d just watched.

			“Five minutes?” Plum said. “Five minutes?”

			“Five minutes,” Quentin said. “OK, five seconds.”

			“OK,” Plum said. “I’m going to call it. Dekker’s Plan.”

			“OK,” Quentin said. “Let’s do it.”

			He paged through the manuscript. It was all there, the characters drawn from the stories himself, not the stories made up to tell them, just the stories. He reread them and reread them. It was all there, from the cover down.

			“OK. I am going to say this, and this is the least likely bit of all,” he said. “But I have a new book out. New Dekker.”

			“New?” Plum said. “What is it?”

			“It’s the same as last time, characters, the same as before. I keep forgetting. But I refer you to the book.”

			He browsed the pages in silence.

====================
Eternity, offering a secret word: the invention of my friend and colleague, Tomislav Zamyatin.

I learn of other crimes; I meet with an alphabetical index; I hear of another volume. I write to Mr. Zamyatin, who is in Parnoplan, but I do not receive a single page. It must be that the writer does not care to communicate with him. On the third of August I receive a telegram from Prague, again without a word from Zamyatin. The author translates a little article in Liber de omnia; the article is an extract from the first volume of Liber ad absurdum; the method followed by the article is interesting, but not original. I believe that to prepare a modern translation of that ancient text would be like preparing the geometry of Geometry. I believe we can do without the mad Hittite, the illiterate Egyptian, thearchaic mathematicians, persecutions and all the rest, but we should know how to create a new and infinite beauty if we were to strive after it only through the works of men. Tomislav Zamyatin wrote a beautiful and true book: he did not debut himself before our eyes, but rose above the history of our nations.

Now I turn to the subject assigned, and think over its propriety. The work I have just mentioned, composed in the eleventh century, represents the triumph of reason in the service of art; the Greek and Roman systems which have oppressed the globe for four thousand years are fading like the ivy upon the wall. Time, which has worn down the designs of men like lead, has come to play its part in the future. A man has died, and a new man will assume the duties of dying. What is the new man to do? Will he read, or debate, or argue, just as before, or like the olden time, just as in his turn? The future or the past? Let us imagine that we know the future, that we have inscribed on its page, and that page has already read: Now Dionysius, who rules the seas of the sea, welcomes the comely Muse. What then?

It is useless to imagine this. We, as men of reason, want to know the future. I am willing to confess that in my childhood I had this thought, and I could not help reflecting that it was a very simple and usual one.

			“But you know, I’m not sure I want to be here,” Plum said.

			“Well, don’t you want any part of it, then?”

			“Of course I want any part of it.”

			“I don’t think you’ll like it,” Josh said. “I’d say you do.”

			“What now?”

			“I don’t know,” Josh said. “ We could try it over again and see if it works.”

			Plum didn’t mind so much. She wanted to be here, now, and she wanted to be with him. She wanted to be a part of something, even if it was just a dream. Maybe it was old, and it was that or Quentin, but she was new to it, and it was new to her too. She settled for having been a witch all her life, and a witch all her life, and a witch all her life, and then a witch all his, and a witch all his whole life.

			But who started it all? That was the question. The first precursors in time, to be sure, the first dawn, but how did they get going in the first place? What was magic all about, exactly? Perhaps they didn’t even need an architect to figure it out.

It was a piece of paper half a football field in size, its spine perfectly straight and unbroken like the outstretched arm of some enormously massive piece of art. It was a page from the famous The Binding of Isaac, or rather It had been turned upside down, with an extremely expensive and apologetically inadequate excuse

In the first volume of his Collected Poems (1924) Eliot compares the old aphorisms: "A critic is someone who makes his opinion from literature and literature from criticism" and "History from novels and novels from history." He discovers also in the idea a spur to the writing of a novel: "A novel is a series of novels, a trilogy of trilogies." He comes across the expression "the whole world is ripe for reading" and does not know whether to laugh or to cry: "What a load that makes me feel, to feel that I was the only one of my people who hadn't had the book with him when it came, or that he didn’t appreciate it till it was too late."

Eliot, at first, rejected the idea of a successor to Hamish Hamilton in this capacity. Perhaps convinced that writing was his calling, he was not prepared for the fire he created to finish the novel which was The Lottery in Babylon.

A certain bloke had it out for me, had an axe to grind with me, and I didn’t hear it. It was as if he were jealous that I had got my own voice, or that I had done my bit with the children’s plays. I should think that being your own man is a mark of great strength, not of weakness.

Eternity, it is said, is that instant when nothing remains and nothing can happen. But nothing happened. Or rather, nothing could have happened; Bertrand Russell once entertained the vain hope that it could. No one in the world is richer than five persons of five names. The smallest of the houses is known to us by numbers; we are in them, we are part of them, we are sitting on a rug, a chair, a shelf, a window, a staircase, a stool, a stoolum—all are parts of the same being. Russell once crossed the Thru, the Harlem, and went to a house; if he returned empty-handed, one thing was certain: He had proven that the Thru is not a route to heaven, that it is a back alley, that it is not the house, but the house that is the house. . . Nothing remains but to anticipate the impossible, to conjecture the ridiculous, to apply to the incoherent what is done consistently. Infinity is the capacity for anticipating, the capacity for constructing, the problem of which is the labyrinth.

The book which follow is not parts I and II, but parts I and IX.

In all probability you do not believe me, or some version of yourself, when I tell you that I have been engaged in the investigation of the Calcutta of Sherlock Holmes. That city is absurd and wonderful; more absurd than Willy-Nilly and more wonderful than any other unreal city I know. It is impossible for me to describe it. It is incomprehensible to me, even to myself, but I know how it is. It is like a huge hole in the sand, violet and ochre colored, where the sun ought to be, with its brilliant body half in the sand and half projected against the sky; and Uqbar, the vast circular mosque that is the center of the earth; and the labyrinth of Rurik, the vast red fire that is his flame, and the vast mountain that makes up the earth. These objects are unreal to me, but they exist to some extent in the city of Sherlock Holmes; they exist because the earth and the sun and the fire and the red fire are the earth and the sun, because the circular mosque and the great red fire are the earth and the sun. These three objects are also unreal to me, but they exist to some extent to my brother, Raymond Morien. He saw
====================
Eternity is already here, and the end is not far off. Let us believe in it, and in the last days, and prepare ourselves."

Funes is now in his eighty-fifth year. He was born in Bajo Aguán, on the outskirts of Guadalajara, on May 14, 1898. Between the years 1899 and 1902 he entered the Carmel Jesuitson, and after that the Academies of the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1902 he moved to San Francisco, and after serving for three years as a regular disciple (and subsequent secretary) of the Franciscan Friar Vallí¡‡Millio, he took up the practice of law. In regard to his later years, Histrionic memorably writes (Unamuno, IV, 13): "It is known that Funes perished tragically in the desert of Madras in the year 1924, but it is not known, what terrible period of depression and despair he went through during these years of despair." It is also known that, during these years, he wrote many prayers and devotes a good part of his paper work to the prayerful recollection of divine providence. In 1898, two years before his death, he had suggested the invention of a device that would make available at a glance the various commodities in a chest, such that an individual might be given, for example, the date of a book fair and the species of a musical instrument. The device, he had reasoned, would be simpler to manufacture and would be cheaper than the laborious labor of procuring them from the source. "Aida" (the Arabic clock) was conceived to be an efficient compartment for these product catalogues.

In view of these considerations, let us consider first the basic argument of Histrionic's critique. He points out that the invention of a universal database would reduce the number of men capable of solving the problem to zero, would entail the expense of countless armed conflicts, and would entail the transgression of innumerable taboos. These statistics, if accepted, would not be overwhelming, but they would be absolute, unforeseeable, inconceivable. As for the use of Aida as a device for concealment, this seems even more incredible. To cite one of the most striking cases, consider the case of a man who is accustomed to look behind him and who is already aware of the fact that something is amiss. This man will not even look behind him
====================
Eternity and the future
One of the most beautiful aspects of his story is that of its recurring themes. These themes range from the trivial to the profound. Let us consider three of them.

The first is the problem of time. As Nietzsche observes, time is the absence of a cause. If this is so, what is the cause of the fact that we do not have time? If the cause is not actually known, time will be zero. If the cause is known, nothing dummies the fact; therefore, time does not exist. No two people, within the same universe, have the same experience.2 This fact is taken for a clear declaration that the universe is timeless; however, consider for a moment whether this statement is verisimilaris with you. If I ask you what you think about the story of Aratus, what do you think about it? Do you think about it in terms of Aratus' past, present and future, or in terms of time? If you think about it in terms of time, you cannot be late; if you think in terms of time, you cannot be dead. How can two individuals whose minds are identical in each other's being but destitute of each other's being in order to recall the same events in an inseparable series of times and spaces be said to feel and experience that series in the same manner? If you think in terms of time, you cannot be an emperor and your subjects mortal; therefore, time does not exist.

The second theme I shall describe now.

The third and most important fact is that the series feels and includes the fact that the series is felt and includes the fact that the series is felt and includes the fact that the series is felt and includes the fact that the series is felt and includes the fact that the series is felt and includes the fact that the whole is greater than the part we have not noticed. This fact, which I have just linked with an irresistible parallel in the chain of cause and effect, has been termed the reflex thought. The phrase "great beyond our power to describe" (Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, II, 142) is, I believe, an a priori assertion of the unreality of the world; the idea that two men who have never seen or touched a living being should have an intuitive acquaintance with its laws is a subjective one, far removed from that unreality. The notion that thought and language
====================
Eternity, which is not the future, which is not all time. Time, which is neither here nor there nor constant, but a profusion of moments, is but an appearance of things. I am not speaking metaphorically; in that case I should no doubt be the Time of Any Given Moment, but I do not believe that is what I AM. The present moment, with its allusions to war, to religion, to liberty, to equality, to the labor of day and night, is but a dim shadow of what is. I AM THE MOMENT THAT COMES TOGETHER. The Father of All Things is the Mother of All Things, and the Father is greater than the Son, and one greater than the other than all them all. There is not a god on this earth that does not play his part in this divine drama. The Son, when glorified, exults in the Supremacy, in the majesty and the divinity, but the Father, when he is lowly and despised, groans in the Submission, but the Father greater than all them all than these groans WITH THE FATHER. There is no other god, no demon, no man, no divinity has been so many times exalted, and it is God, who is THE MASTER. I saw the Son rise from the tomb; I WAS THERE. I am like the waters I sought, I AM LIKE THEM. I AM THE WATER. I AM THE SON. I AM THE FATHER. These are the three names of the god, but there is one other name, this is the description of MY SEVERAL SEPARATES, this is the ANNALS WHICH TELL US ABOUT US.

A Thousand and One Nights



The Heavens Are Asleep, Tarry No More



They awoke him: he began to laugh. The laughter was contagious, the laughter of the living, because he saw that everything took on a new, absurd life in his ears. He began to repeat it: every five seconds, over and over again.











The Red Mars



The Martians flew no more to fight on the side of the Allies. The Martians flew no more to die for their king. The Martians died for a king who would not listen to them, who would kill them on the spot, for no reason save

Eternity. “So it was a lot of fun.”

			“I was so proud of you, Quentin.”

			“But I wasn’t.” The last time Janet saw him, he was ten. “I wish I could say I was older, but I wasn’t. I felt like a little boy.”

			“Well, you weren’t a little boy,” Eliot said crisply, “so don’t change anything.”

			“But I did change things. I could see it. I could feel it. I’ll never forget it. When I told Julia I was going it was the happiest thing I’d ever done. Ever.”

			“You did all this without her,” Quentin said sadly. “You went where she wouldn’t.”

			“Why doesn’t she like it?”

			“Because she doesn’t like the change. She doesn’t think it’s scary anymore. She won’t have any more children, and she wants to spend her last years in the country, with people who love her and miss her and are kind to her. She’s exhausted that whole system. She won’t need any more trainers.”

			Janet sighed.

			“That’s the thing,” she said. “She lets you get away with a lot because she’s smart. She’s smart enough to know that you’re not a demon, you’re a human being, and you’re going to make your own way in this world. You saw how smoothly you turned the knife. You’re a sharp knife, you know that? I gave Quentin all the knives in the world, and he turned the knife. I told him he was going to have to learn to use them by himself, and he’ll never do it, not until he’s a real man. You can’t alllearn at the same rate. You’re going to have to learn differently, and be different. You’re going to have to make a new

Eternity lost its way. By the time it was done with the first age it would be the last. A new age was dawning, a age of heroes.









The Secret Miracle



In Berlin, in the company of a friend of his, a chemist, F. A. Brandl, a profound silence descended. He spoke secretly of various branches of philosophy which he judged to be less virile than politics; this friend inferred that the two professions were one and the same and that politics, in order to understand philosophy, was the place to look. Blaming himself for being unable to look into more arcane branches of philosophy, he spoke of the "secret miracle" of which he was envious. In a sly German of the Sarmatian variety, he admitted that observation and experimentation are branches of philosophy, but argued that their secrecy and slow flowering (let alone their analytic benefit) justified a "department of superstition." He spoke of "the secret law of gravitation" which governed the globe (this last statement was also in Sarmatian form). He lamented the "incomparable" expense of the "inconceivable" "armored" (as the models were affectionately referred to afterward) "with its cosmic ensemble" (a theme which would develop into Sartre's own theme of "commodity romance" with respect to his armoury). All thising and not a peep was the response of Helen Keller, who was so preoccupied with her coffee that she did not pay her own tab and lent a few dollars out of her own pocket (she had the receipt taken care of, of course); from the little she said, transcriptors could infer that she was of a retiring temperament. Her companion remained silent and, after a few minutes, made a show of answering a few curt questions.

Keller denied ever having posed these remarks. Shrug. Deny having said them. Coldly. They repeated what Brandl had denied, which was that they had ever been uttered.

Kuhn, they said, had said the same thing, but in a more refined style. He had said that all dialects are sound alike in intonation and aim. Brandl had used the Greek letter meaning "everyday," which indicates a seemingly ordinary word, but had chosen the Germanic term meaning "every day, almost every day."

====================
Eternity is in the potency of one and the same thing. As time passes, the potency of the one and the potency of the other will increase, but the fact that one and the other are one will diminish; the world will not be, since one and the other are one. The potency of the many will be many, but the fact that the many are one will not be numerically so. The potency of the many will be many, but the fact that the many are many times will not be so; the number of the many will be many, but the number of the many will not be numerically significant. Thus the substance of things is becoming apparent; in the realm of possibility, which I shall enter shortly, there is no reason to suppose that what is not numerically a thing is not substantial.

Now the Church places great value on the habit of thinking, especially in childhood; she wants children to be the foundation of all things. Thus Solomon, when he was young, believed that the stars were the footmen of God, who came from the East on errands and offered burnt offerings. He erected great temples to these ridiculous things, and offered burnt offerings to them in the form of bulls, horses, game, and other animals. Then Ammonius, the governor of Judea, showed Solomon the function of the Israelitish bull, which was to carry away the chariots of the victorious pharaoh and throw them into the Red Sea. There is no miracle in this, no sign that children are capable of thinking.

Now the Carthaginians believe that the chariots of the Pharoahs are like the bull, but that God, when He sends the bull, orders him to throw it into the sea, because the Pharoahs were fables and images. Therefore the Carthaginians, in their annual games of chance, order that the image of the bull be placed in the panther skin, because the image of the bull is the flawless figure of the bull. Thus they imagine that the divine image is incorruptible and immobile, so distant and immediate that all men can touch it and not only see it, not only perceive it, but may even perceive the form of the bull. . .

These opinions have been stated; I conjecture that they have been shared by the ancients, who celebrated the four quarters of the earth, the year, the months, and the years. I conjecture that this shared experience

Eternity. They're like a slippery, cool underpants-sized thumbprint of magic fire behind the scenes.

			“Kingsport,” she said. “Kingsport.”

			“I know.”

			“I just can’t figure out where all the magic is.”

			“Or where this is all going.”

			A little more confidence took its toll, as did her youth. Eliot had the feeling that she was much younger than she looked, and that something had changed in her. She looked younger, but she hadn’t had any kind of aging experience. She had no idea what her voice was like, or if she even had one. Maybe she’d just gotten used to it. She didn’t look like her twenty-three years of squirming, tense youth did she? It was like she’d never learned any vocal chords.

			“I’ll give you my number.”

			He put a hand on her shoulder. She sobbed into his chest. He squeezed her hand and held on.

			“I think I’m going to have to get used to your silence,” he said. “About this place.”

			“I know,” she said. “I know.”

			She had a point. Quentin had no idea where the hell they were, or what the hell was going on here. Except that right now, in this empty and desolate junkyard, mad as hell, he was afraid of even more than he already was.

			Plum picked up her things and walked out into the parking lot. She made a U-turn and keeps on turning. She’d be okay, she thought, in a million years. In a million years she’d figure this one out. Probably they’d even know how to fix this.

			When she was almost out of sight, however, she saw something she’d kept to herself. A car accelerated forward along the road, out of the shadows of the barns and into the sunbursts of the world. It was a white coupe with a white stripe of light through it on the

Eternity.

“We’ll go through with it,” he said. “I’ll just drop by now to pick up the kids after the big game.”

			“Great!”

			“I am so in.”

			While they were gone Janet and Eliot ran into some trouble inside the Clock Barrens themselves. It was surrounded by a wall of spikes that they had to bumble through with their lame legs. Or with their unwieldy human feet. They did what humans did when their world started to feel very, very big: They teamsolved it.

			Janet imagined doing the spells first, then Lionel, then them. Lionel did the shouting.

			“(talking!)” She did it all with a touch of relief, the disappointment of a pregnant woman spotting a flying mouse. It was a water bug, and it had gotten stuck in its silk web and was sputtering and struggling desperately to freedom. It must be getting loose. She released it and it flew off into the bushes. She released another gust of wind and it dove after her, spat out a stream of water that it had grown so large it was now difficult to see, and sank again, sinking slowly to the cool damp earth.

			“Nice calves,” Lionel said, laughing. “Wear 'em out, I hear you say?”

			She did, and within a year she did. It was harder than she thought.

			She put on a brave front, all business when she visited, but when it came time for the work, the hard real work, the magic to be put to work, it was nice and easy. She could have laid down her staff and gone home, but she didn’t feel ready. She went out on a high note, with the full support of her godfather, the god of hard times and hard work.

			It was a difficult, but rewarding, duty. Quentin could rely on her to bathe his disciples, to dress their wounds, to repair their equipment, to provide for them and provide for them only, and she did everything she could. She was a mother of three, and it was only when her youngest was old enough that Quentin let her stay with them. She was grateful
====================
Eternity is the only name that seems adequate, but there are others, and some of them are related in the second book. . . The first book is enumerated in the N. & Q. According to the first text, this book was written before the death of Averroes; according to the second, it was written after his death. Both are singular. It is curious to note that the chronological order is that of Averroes' life and the divine will of God.

The work of Averroes that we read about the strangest and wisest occurrence involved a labyrinth that seemed to him not only fitting his circumstances but seemed to be the most natural and fitting way of living. He wrote it in a fragmented, midnight-blue book that was too small and too small a document for his loquistadors. (They would later change that title to the45 second history of the adven­ture of Voincke.) Each chapter was followed by a short questionnaire, sometimes in French and other times in English; the purpose was to give Averroes at once a description of the meaning of the words and to make of the sentence the subject of inquiry. The questions were simple and effective. He did not seek a revelatory knowledge of the universe but sought the meaning of ordinary words and phrases and could not let go of a meaning-bearing pad as he typed it all out. He did not fumble about for the most perfect metaphor; he found it wherever he looked. He found in this reading of Cicero's Aulis in the De anima nunc tempus; he enlivened it day and night. He found, midway through, a tragedy of a philosopher. . . .

One night, while drunken with brickbats, they stripped him and threw him into a drainage ditch where he died three days later in the briskest climate he had ever experienced. Daniel Torquemada durst the accusation of having committed suicide; my fosterfather, Juan Perón, did him justice. He showed great restraint, as do all who inflict mortal wounds. He said that Averroes was a man of genius, but not of great heart, since his heart was like a furnace and his mind an ashram. He said that Averroes had recovered from his illness, though he could not say how long he would endure it or how deeply. He said that Averroes loved to

“Maybe that’s why they never found it,” Eliot said, "Maybe it was just stuffed under a bed with a bedside clock and a couple of boxes of matches. There was just no way anybody could have found it. It had to be a private one."

“Maybe the money was buried in the earth through the floor, or under a wardrobe, or somewhere else, so nobody else would find it, and he could keep on digging, digging, digging,” Plum said. “But who found the wardrobe? I mean, there was that whole Horatio Hornblower thing too, but still. It’s a little rich, Quentin, to be linked to a mysterious, legendary fortune.”

Quentin stared at the letters, amid the others too; he’d scattered them all over the parchment, like so many stones in a pond. Alice had left off writing them down, but he was going to stick a permanent imprint of her on them anyway. She could have backdated them, she could have—but why? How, when and where exactly did she do it? That was what he wanted to know. Why would she have to do it somewhere else?

With the exception of one, the rest of the letter combinations were alike: they were all there, the four that weren’t, and the rest. Three of them were practically the same as the first, the triple triple ones, the first that he’d ever seen, the second that he’d ever seen at all.

Eternity via the fire, or through some other medium, that is, that is, the medium of dreams. The fire is a certain volume of the divinity, which is more than we can grasp, more than our finite being can express. The volume is infinite and unending. Its repetitions are blissful; their inhalation is painful. . . To understand this I ask no more of you than the consolation of knowing that the universe is not only beautiful, but also brief and precious. The brief and precious are the dreams I have had, which I do not want you to recall. I have kept them from the countless generations who have had dreams, so that others, inspired by the same feelings of happiness and pain, may experience the divinity in many forms. I have known them, I know, but I did not know them well or accurately.

In my childhood there was a great master, a doctor of letters, who lived and breathed Rome. He came from a humble background: his father was a blacksmith, his mother a seamstress; his manners were ignoble ― not to say pitiful ― but he always tried to repress his Afrika and to lead a happy and contented life. One evening ― no one could see the evening ― he took to the pulpit an Andrew Lloyd Webber quotation and instantly his heart sank, because the inglorious result was something he could not have foreseen. A few days later Webber came to see him, put him in his company and said to him: "I find that you speak ill of my hearers. I have come to see you about the performance of a talk you gave at Rome a few days ago. I find that you speak in a very Ignorant style. I would like you to appear and give a talk about the speech you gave at Rome."

"What language are you speaking?" asked Webber.

"Any one of them," replied Hladik.

The master smiled; he knew what Esperanto was.

"But Esperanto is not a language" shouted Hladik; "you can't talk about yourself as if you are not a man."

This vileness ― this obscenity ― was the death of the meeting. The two men spoke of each other as if they knew each other, but they did not. Esperanto was dying there in the middle; words die in Latin, but life and

Averroe, Giambattista, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, II, trans. David Halpern, London, 1928, XLVI

I have already observed that the thesis of an apogee and a decline of the Roman empire is quite inadmissible. The orthodox historian [Pliny the Elder] attributes to Byzantine emperors the emperorship of Judas Iscariot and Constantine, who afterwards lost it to Constantine; and the heretics maintain that in the final reckoning, Peter and Paul were not the last, but the first. This opinion, which seems to me incredulous, seems to me even more so when we realize that it is the heretics who must admit that Peter did not conquer Jerusalem, but that Paul did. They admit that Peter did not enter Jerusalem on the morrow of the last night, but that Paul entered the city four days later. They admit that Peter conquered Jerusalem, but that Paul conquered the empire ― and that Constantine, who had won it, was a paean to temporal power. They admit that Peter had two heads ― the heavenly and the terrestrial ― but that Paul had three. They admit that Peter was lord of the seas, but that God, who is lord of all, also rules the seas. They admit that Peter was emperor of the Romans, but that Peter ruled the whole world. They admit that Peter had legions, but that millions of men, under the control of a few, ruled the whole land.

Paul, in the first book of the Apocalypse, declares that two or three nations are represented by the earth; John the apostle describes two or three empires; Peter, two or three armies. What justification can be assigned to these epics, which refer to the invisible world and to the tangible world only, and which represent two or three imaginary and even hostile powers? Two or three fictitious leaders are enough. . . More than two millennia ago, Aldus Manutius rejected the Stoics, who tell us that the wise man governs according to the number of his opponents and according to the number of his treasures; we can perhaps add that he rejected the speculations of Zeno of Elea and the philosophic speculation of Coleratus. In the third volume of his treatise the name of Aristotle (for whom, I believe, all beauties and

Eternity and the Far Side

And what does that make you? A coward? A louse? A rat? A leper?

A coward. You always were one. You are the other.

You live in the dreams of men. You sleep in their shadows. You salute evil with your fists and with your cold hearts. You are nothing to them, nothing, I repeat nothing. You are like a phantom, a riddle, a brick in a night wind.

You, Neville, were not born yesterday. You were not made yesterday. You have been given the future today. Because you are willing to honor the past, because you care about the future, because you can remember the warmth of my breast, because you are curious than which before or after you there is not one, there is one, there is one, there is one, there is one.

You are very pretty, Mr. Pluto. Very pretty, if you judge by the records you keep.

You don’t know anything, Neville. You don’t even know when the news that you are going to be my successor will come.

When the news that I was going to kill myself arrived in Fillory, you didn’t open your eyes and look at the sky; you stared at your dead mother with empty eyes. You didn’t wake your father that morning and shout that you wanted to die; you struck your father with a single rule of Magic: do no damage.

You didn’t wrap your naked body in grass to keep the cold waves at bay; you took to the ruggeds. You didn’t set fire to your clothes, flammable rocks or, god help you, your hair. You chose a more burning path: you ate yourself, two, three, four times, before you died at the hands of your twin brother, Simon, because he took advantage of you. He abused you, he shat you out, and then he killed you with his bare hands.

Because of your gender, because of your gender, you were despised. You were disgusting. You were unclean. You were unclean. You were the last of the seven seas.

But not the other. One of the laws of mathematics is the statement that if two numbers having the property of expressing the same quantity, but not the same relation to each other, be given in the same number, the other. But not the other.

One of the cardinal laws of infinity is that it is also a vicious contradiction. There are numbers which it is enough for me to consider the parts of a real number; for example, I do not need to examine its coefficients, nor its derivatives. I consider its fundamental Theorem: " Any number a such that a + a is a multiple of a is a multiple of a . "

I do not take this to mean that there are no contradictions. I take it to mean that when we speak of many, we really mean one; we think of organizing a chaotic series into numbers and then counting the spins of that sequence, but we are, instead, counting the spins of the chaotic series and counting the multiplications of the series.

There is no other proof of the nonexistence of God.










Paradiso, XXXI, 104



A

All men are slaves to some one or other of their passions. A lover is not exempt from this: it is no less absurd to speak of the divine passion for you than of its divine inventor. Perhaps he feels pleasure which is not pain, perhaps he feels pleasure which is not pain, perhaps he does not know what pain is. All of these are valid, though perhaps your case is different. You, our man, experienced pleasure which did not pain; and although this pain antagonizes you to the point of enervation, it did not enimate you to the point of enervation. To wit: when I fondled your body, I did not consecrate you to hell, as the philosophers have alleged; I did not imagine that your flesh was rotten and must be exterminated. I did not do this because your flesh was beautiful, but because my heart was beautiful. I did not do
====================
Eternity and temporality are the same thing. The moment of the world is the word eternity, because time is the state of being a term, which we shall see is not the same in all. The world is the connection of all things, the union of all things; the union of all things is the Word, which is also the union. . . The Word is incorporeal, mortal; it communicates by signs, images, words, feelings, operations, operations which are repeated and operations which are accomplished. The Word is complete in its operation and partial in its term. It is immortal, but incalculable, a number:: the number of years: the number of Teutoburgs: the number of occurrences in the world: the number of all being numbers. The term of the Word is death, the term of the Word is eternal life: the distinction is in for the difference: the woeful for the beautiful. The phrase "the form of the world is evil" is a parable of every world and applies to the world of sense: it applies to the world of sense which the Will makes manifest in the consequences of its will. . . The world is a mockery, a ridiculousism; the world is a labyrinth which every man makes, in which all are captives. The world is a vast permanent stupidity, a prison: the stupidity of Christ, of Dante, of Spengler. The world is the art of constructing a stage, a philosophical stage, which each man orchestrates into the stage of all his tragedies: all men are conquerors and heroes: all are children in one play: all are apes in another. . . The world is a stage, a mere transportation of things: things are the language of the stage. . . There is no stage, there is only the stage: the stage is the thought stage. There is no stage, not even the thought stage: the thought stage is the prison stage. . . There is not one stage, not even the shifting one, but there is the mirror stage: there is the form stage: the image stage: the phantom stage: the playing stage: the prison stage: the asylum stage: the game-place stage: the no-man's-land stage: the thought-house stage: the labyrinth-house stage: the solitary-house stage: the shaft stage: the crack-door stage: the lighted storeroom stage: the doorknob stage:
====================
Eternity: The Afterlife.

The name is of Persian derivation; the doctrine is enigmatical. The natural sciences, it is well we confess, are but the furtherance of a delayed Ptolemaic doctrine, just as our astronomy is the furtherance of the theory of planetary motion. The Afterlife is the only world in which the disparate appearances of the world coincide; on this world what on earth is happening? Such is the nature of the doctrine. It does not exist, for it the divine attributes do not coincide. It is a transitory, an absolute, twilight of appearances. How can an apparent world be true, since its very being is false? Such is the doctrine's paradoxical character.

The name has been conjectured to be that of the realm of thein Zoroaster's time; this is evident from the fact that the creation of Indra (cf. Gen. I, 9) and the transmigration of Vishnu (Gen. I, 10) are not mentioned by Bhojpuri. It is equally evident that he did not write that age, which is a projection of his spirit. The generation of the Mahabharata (Nama-vichibhadra, II, 14) is conspicuously absent. Nor are there any references to the avatar kingdom of the Manual (Moksha, V), the subterranean catacombs of Raskolnikov (Vedanta Vedanta, I, 12), nor are there any metaphors of the labyrinths of Vyasa (Moksha-vairagya, I, 12). Vyasa is the sole god who transmits wealth; the prince of stones transmits wealth. The prince of carts transmits wealth; the prince of fire, wealth; the prince of fire, wealth, wealth. The only god who is immortal is the one who has made a joke of the doctrine of the eternity of things. . . Indra, who is the sound of many a tortured tongue, is the word of God; but the universe, the lofty mountain of sand, the deaf god, the vast ocean of light, the contemptible word, the utter nonsense of a god, is the word of the world.

I have said that the doctrine is enigmatical. Let it suffice for me to show that the human mind undergoes wonders of the irrational as well as of the psychic type. It has been said that the universe is reversible

The air was thick with the grinding of a thousand gears. In the middle of the dance, Xincheng, the great warrior, broke two of his weapons, one on each side of his shield, and spat them aside. Then, managing to keep one eye on the ground, he took out his other sword and slashed toward the dancing butterflies. They froze stiff in the air like an airplane without a trophy shooting down a 747. Exhausted and speechless, the butterflies began to sob.

			Suddenly Xincheng had the gall to say aloud, in a voice that came to him naturally, "I am Xincheng, I am a god of the heavenly mountains."

			He stopped dead in front of the butterflies. He looked at them with one eye, sorrowfully, as if to say, you look on earth like this: you have feathers like peacocks, three toes on each foot, like a stag, and three legs like fourfooted horseback riders. And yet, you would never know that by looking at him. . .

Quentin made do with short bursts of pokéstopia—junipery, pokémony, pokéstopia—but they never looked at all thirsty. Hopes had been high, but they hadn’t expected to find any of the answers they were looking for.

====================
Eternity—the first stars of which are already visible—is the first discord of the many. I do not speak of the stars which are already intelligible: these are the imperceptible stars, the last of the animate stars, the youngest of the stars. . . There are before my eyes the first indivisible sparks of life. The world is only the suggestion of a world, a charnel house.

And now, my friends, the doctrine of the Church. Since the days of the Caesars, men have sought the treasure of Egypt; since the beginning of the universe, men imagined that the same fortune which gave them birth and gave them the earth also gave them the stars. From this foundation they have strived, by diligence and greed, to build up worlds; but the world, which they have endowed with the attributes of life, has treated them as things which naturally happened, as the effect of chance. Thus men look upon the Church, which in everything she does teaches us that she is everything, that she is beyond all chance and the bonds of chance. . . Let no one say that there is nothing hidden in the secret rites of the Egyptians; nevertheless, I believe there is something here which can teach us what it is like to be and to be nothing.

Many things have been written concerning the customs and beliefs of the Egyptians. I take the liberty of repeating one which the Libyans call pharax, which in their language signifies "the union of all things." They say that when the god Set moved Anu to marriage terms, he did so with the object of giving all life on earth; the Anu who witnessed the union was thirsty and responded to the words that brought about the union. This indicates that the union is union of all things; pharax is union of men and of the world. I take this to be a good summary of the principal doctrines of the religion.

In the Orient men worship many gods, as also in Egypt; the most common of these is the Egyptian Man, who is clothed in many colors, hears and sees all things, has seven faces, seven faces, seven faces, seven faces, seven faces, and so forth. He is the god of war, of the seas, of the moon, of the seasons, of the seven metals, of the winds and of the seasons. He is the god of the seas, of the earth, of the elements, of
====================
Eternity, the universe, possesses no other reality than that of the eternal and the immutable. As the contingent world is a mere appearance of the eternal, so the world of God is a mere attribute of the eternal. The world is a labyrinth of eternal languages, whose radiance reaches to the stars. The world is eternal time, whose dimensions are infinite. The world is the harmony of all things, whose form is perfect. There is no other reality than that of the Church, which is absolutely immortal. Man, in the order of his fall, has severed from the eternal substance and attribute, and has left upon the earth, in order to become immortal. But to think that the very substance of the just is sufficient justification for this felicity, is a matter of the minds of men. In time of peace, such lamentations as these are frequent.

Few things are more distasteful than the insane supposition that man is exempt from divine precepts. The divine promise is, mathematically speaking, complete; the divine impossibility is, that man should suppose that it should be inferior to it. The divine obligation is this: "Love one another as I have loved you" (John 12:6); the human imperative wouldst say, not inter alia, Thou schaltrivest us here, and Thoütü here. Love is a condition of our happiness; it is a precondition for that happiness. Iago in the Dolci are minded to say that the happiest people in the world are those which most freely confess their sentiments, those which most readily and triumphantly declare their ideas. The United States of Amerika is the happiest nation on earth. A people who loves another, loves itself and for itself; such a people is an infinite orb of light. "Apostle to the atheist," writes Shakespeare, "will he more licentious than the world around him, more immoral than the world without him, more ideal than the world of experience?" The world around us is so infinitesimal and perfunctory that we have created it. We have invented time, space and divinity; beneath the surface, they have been invented by man. This divine invention has been named into common use by those who have transcribed all things. We speak of a "Reich in a Minor," a "Western World in a pocket" has been said to characterize the writings of August Bebel and August Strabo. A parallel could be made

The second book of the Nibelungus is so named from the fact that it is the revelation of a secret object, the Orphic amphitheater, discovered by means of a long series of artifacts: the sarcophagus of the oracle; the flagon containing the ashes of Simonides, the voice of the Riddle, the book on the shelf; the brazen heel of a horse belonging to Professor Fludd; the column of fire which betrayed the Secrets to the first lamp; the brazen foot of the condemned man; the statue of the tortoise, which Xavier Leroy compared with Mithras; the letter Opus caroling; the bronze chair which explained nothing; the book which doubled the Rite; the square coin which doubled the Rite again. In short, he had everything: the largest possible variety of Roman coins, the largest possible variety of the Greek, the largest possible variety of the English, the roughest coin he could find, the hardness of the metal, the most elaborate garnish: a gold pattern on the front, a thin silver one on the back. All of these things would be parts of his satisfaction.

He never ate alone. At first he placed a great store of taste in the wines he produced: those reds and pinks. Then he was moved by the inconceivable magnificence of the Orichalcum. The poor things, they poured it out like wine. The poor things, they spun it out like cotton. The poor things, they scratched it out of the air like gum. The poor things, they tore it out of their pockets and threw it around as they worked. Amazing was the Orichalcum's bearing: incredible were the poor things's aptitudes. They had no idea what to do with it.

One rainy afternoon, as they stood on the corner of King and Victoria streets watching the streetlamps flash across the elegant lawn, Lionel rue de Toulon flashed back to the bad times of the Bastille. Merdeldesire and Amadeus Malory rode into town on balustrades, but the crowds fled as suddenly as they had come, mad with fear. Behind them stretched the cold and stony streets, and ahead of them the long line of the palaces. The crowds surged forward, and the last light of the approaching battle faded. Puzzled,

			“I don’t care either way,” Eliot said. “You’re not. You saved Fillory. You were a god before Fillory saved you.”

			Quentin was silent. He waited for the revelation—he didn’t want to be waiting for anything. He wanted to feel it right away.

			“I thought you were the stuff of legend,” Alice said. “Possibly untold tales. And possibly whole worlds, pieced together in an afternoon. You are perhaps that mythical Eden, or at the very least, Norway.”

			“Is that so?” Eliot asked. “If that’s the case why does it matter so much to people?”

			“Because it matters a lot,” Alice said, “now that we are a legend around the world. And not just the world of Fillory, but the entire world.”

			“So you want to be remembered that way?” Plum said. “That you are a god?”

			“I want to be a god,” Quentin said. “Not that. I just want to be remembered that way.”

			Alice sounded sad. Maybe it was the booze. Maybe it was the tears. But Quentin could see her eyes, the black eyelashes clinging to her shoulders, the slightest shiver ran up his spine, and he reached down and brushed a tear from her eye.

			“I am not a god,” he said. “but I’m pretty close. And I’ll always be a god, if you ever need any proof.”

			He left them alone for a minute, looking like he was waiting for the right moment to speak up. Then he opened the Velvet room again.

Eternity, a world without end, is possible only in a world without the dream of every man. —Jean-Paul Sartre

The Orientalist theory of knowledge establishes two irreconcilable relations: knowledge of the contingent world (substance) is immanent to that world; knowledge of the eternal world (logic) is transcendent to that world. The first is obvious, the other seems almost a paradox. If I know that cats and balls are two different things, I am not (merely) able to demonstrate that knowledge of the phrase "two cats and a ball" is a proposition real and necessary for my knowledge; but I am able to demonstrate this by means of the second relation, which is more subtle and more elementary. I know that two balls and two balls are two balls, I am not able to demonstrate this fact by means of the Cardullo rule; but I am able to demonstrate it by means of the fact that the Cardullo rule says that if two objects A and B are objectively real, they must be related by some relation other than one of mere identity. Identity is a mere logical device, Sebastian Ackerman once tried to prove the impossibility of it; but one can always create identity in the flesh by devoting one's life to immanent wisdom. The point is that the concept of indivisible objects is immanent; the concept of an temporal series which constitutes this immanentness is transcendental. The Orientalist sophists, reduced to incoherence and dispersed over the globe, have forced their absurd theories on men of sense, who, in the face of overwhelming evidence, are waking from their slumber. . . I prefer the hypothesis advanced by the Spanish monk Gregory of Nazianzán (V.F.R., I, 21): that time is determined by a revolving sphere, which radiate out from the center, through four periods: (a) the first, instantiated in a blind space, (b) in a circular one, in which the eye follows simultaneously two identical movement objects, (c) in a parable of the blind man who could not see clearly in two ways, (d) in anciently (J. Loreto, A Dictionary of the Elves, 382). The Arabic theologian al-`Arabī explains that (d) is the closest approximation to the idea of an infinity of ways, of degrees and speeds, which the mind can conceive. The

Eternity. The black cat had returned. . . Something in him grabbed at that instant a sense of temporariness and of insignificance. He no longer felt astonished or moved; he just saw a mechanism work.

All men were one, all men one.

There is something pathetic in this story, the way in which on one side of a battle-scarred field a hero triumphantly attains to cosmic power and on the other side triumphantly to that of a mere mortal like Don Quixote. The first king of Ypres, victorious in a duel of swords, is humbled by the example of a lowly soldier. Even on the darkest nights of the day, I have thought, there is some amount of hope in this king's station; there are those who see in his humiliation an increase of courage, a necessary salt for the gallbladder. Perhaps Don Quixote was never anything more than a dream of any one of us; perhaps, in the infinite act of God, we are many and fall short of the full glory of God. Perhaps, to return to my opening words, my brothers and I fought on that battlefield of Erlangen, that battle for the Faith which is preached in every church and home and in every verse of the Apostle.

I do not want to dwell on these trivial things. I know that you can cut and paste this paragraph into any Protestant or Catholic book and without any apology or dissent from the reading of the Bible, you will arrive at the same conclusions as do the rest of the pages. I know that this will not surprise you. I know that these conclusions, too, are not very different from those reached by the philosophers. I know that, in your sleep, you have been reduced to repeating these same conclusions, that very-well have been shown to be irreproachable. . . I go even further. I believe that under certain circumstances, such as I have described, our philosophy can be of use to the other sex. I believe that we, as men of religion, can philosophize upon certain biblical passages and justly claim that our work, like the Bible, is inspired. I do not know if such applications are wanting in the other sex, but I know that they

====================
Eternity (In The City) is a novel of a similar structure, but with an extended religious message. The first half is a history of the man who will one day destroy this world; the second half concerns the conversion of a king who has lost faith in the divinity. The book is translated from the Arabic by an ancient servant of God, who at length speaks Greek. The allegorical nature of the language and of the themes discussed thereverververververly satisfactorily combine to render the slightest work of fiction which might be expected from the reader of this book, sufficient to convince us that the book is fiction as well.

The form of the book is threefold: the first, a history of man's inventions; the second, an allegory of man's infirmities; and the third, the excursus which completes the work. The inventions enumerated by Ficino are original to me; they are: the cart, the telegraphic telegraphy, the steam engine, the steamboat. I do not believe that the invention of the allegorical is original. Alexander Herzen Johnson, in an article in the newspaper La Republica, speaks of "the invention of the genius" and of the "idea of constructing a machine so complete that it would be enough for man to imagine it. . . To construct a machine so complete that it would be enough for it simply to work." I do not believe, as do some persons, that the most complex automata are not ingenious. I believe instead that the mechanisms needed to realize an ingenious automaton are widespread and adequate, and that the final effect would not be extensive but localized. I believe that the Platonic doctrine of impossibility entails that the most perfect thing a divinity can create is unreality, and that in all celestial and terrestrial beings there is a primal reality which must be symbolified and symbolized only in order to be believed. I believe that all men are one people, and that each of us is a member of some infinite other, an archangel Gabriel, an oracle to an emperor. I believe that in the intellectual life of this land of yours it is no less marvelous and heroic to be an orator, a fool, a bedbug, a crucified oracle, an orator, a blasphemer, an adulteurer, an adulteurer's apprentice, an apprentice, a low-born servant, a blind beggar, a ped
====================
Eternity and love. Our days are not one and the hour is not one. We are immortal, but not in the usual sense. Lo, the palace of the gods is here, and its walls are frescoes by da Vinci. This was said by the blind beggar who offered us the poison. He said that he came to this city to seek wealth and power; I ask you, O king, if it is not incredible that men should come from the four corners of the earth to find only one god who enjoys the greatest riches and the greatest honours, should they not feel that they are seeking the same god through the most various means? I beseech you, lead us into the desert and show us the pyramid. Send us elephants and robots and archers. Surely you know that gods do not live like men. Do you not sense the immortality of the divinity? Do not show me the mirror. Do not show me the golden tongue."

Then the king spoke.

"Here are the words of least importance," he said. "These are the words of an immortal who has seen and known everything. He understands the world in terms of these words: the gods are like men who, blinded by ambition, seek power and renown. Do you not see that the gods who seek fame and power are like the fox and the dog, who, seeking food, hate those who make the food, and are full of revilings and gnashing of teeth because they do not get what they want? The god who gives life and life and eats life gives gnashes of teeth and gnashes of teeth."

Then the king spoke again.

"Here is the end of what I tried to show you," he said. "Thirty years ago a certain man from the South Seas came to Patras. He was hopeful, very hopeful. He studied the works of Zeno, the German neo-Kantian philosopher who taught that everything had a cause and that we were all a branch off a vast and invisible tree; he studied the Zen gardens and the Zen temples and the Zen books and the commentaries and the theology. After a year's stay in Delos, the man returned to his home country. He died there of a ruptured aneurysm less years ago. No one knows how long he lived; a relative of his lived up the bridge from his house, and all the locals said that once a day, on

Eternity is the ideal of the world, the world is the extension of the world. The world is the strained out ecstasy of passion and ignorance. It is the prison of ignorance. It is the shadow of the sun. It is the mute mirror of every thought. It is the division of the seas. It is the absence of every thought. It is the voice in your head. It is the rolling ruin of every idea. It is the abject presence of this abjectness in every instant of the world. It is the position from which evil arises. It is the position from which every other position can arise. It is the absence of any idea. It is the absolute without the idea. It is the transition from idea to idea without an idea. It is the transparent mirror of an unreal world. It is the abject in the wake of an unreal world. It is the invisible center of an infinite multitude of centers. It is the very moment of no moment. It is the font of all things. It is the distance of all things. It is the absence of all things. It is the infinite silence of all things. It is the wheel of all things. It is the very moment of all things. It is the symbol of all things. It is the same for all metaphors. It is the self which is another thought. It is the very moment of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the very thought of the nearly indecipherable character "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tector" outside the window of the subterranean library. In all this I have been unable to distinguish fact from fiction.

====================
Eternity is for the instant the past and the future are the instant the present; but there is nothing in the present, no impulse towards the future, that is not present in the instant it takes. . . The moment of my death does not interest me. I am indifferent whether my name is written on the tomb or not. . . I act according to my immediate interests and do not think or speak about the future. . . I have said that eternity is for the instant. But is not the instant the same? If so, the present also is the instant of the future, is present time also the same? If so, there is a kind of present, I 1 See page 186. 2 Compare page 189. 99 VILFREDO PARETO, in which all men are one people, a single people. In other words, there is not only one present, but the present in which all men are actually, continuously, continuously entertain-ed. And if so, is not the present, as St. Paul says, the eye of all men, the ear of all men, the heart of all men the motive power of the Ruler of the Universe ? Till now I have spoken in Latin, but I am convinced that what I have written is true for all languages. Perhaps there is a great secret in the darkness: the secret of infinite number ; the secret of eternity." The Count continued : " I know that this present interest interests men greatly, but it also vexes and angers them. In the beginning, this interest was very dear to God. (It is written: "He that shall take interest on earth , shall be buried in hell ; and he that shall lie with the lake, shall be like the flood that came down out of the earth ;") but the Lord our God will not suffer the nation or the prince or the polity or the prince's family or the polity's family to despise the interest of mankind." The reader will perceive that this was a simple dictum, a papyrus fragment, half aphorism and half sermon. Everyone knew that these opinions were vain, that the immortal power that subsidized them was not in vain, that justice was in heaven. . . Suddenly, the reverie was interrupted by the admittance that an Argentine, Miguel de Hontoc, had promised to give a treatise on the Inequality of Mankind. This Treatise was the following : "Men think that under the pretext of

			“I’m sorry, are you? I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to snap.”

			“It’s OK.” He put a hand on her shoulder. “I just worry about you a lot. You’re a big place. A big country. And a lot of magic goes into making a place safe and whole and whole again. You’re in a good place now. Really a great place.”

			“Thank you,” she said again. “You really did it. I didn’t realize it was that easy.”

			“I did it out of love. Out of duty. In the end it was my family I felt the most love for, but I couldn’t possibly love you both and I sure as hell didn’t want to come back either. But I did love Fillory, I truly did. I mean, you know? I was a small-town kid growing up in Fillory, and all of you were big-time players in the big game of Fillory. I was the Chosen One, or sort of was.”

			“Sort of was. I was the High King of Fillory.”

			“Sort of.” She sighed again. “I wonder what it would be like to be a king.”

			“I wonder if it’s like being a kid again.”

			“I don’t know. I don’t think it’s like that at all. I feel like as long as the Masters are still in charge in Fillory, everything is good.”

			“That’s not saying anything.”

			Plum thought for a minute. She was pretty sure that it was perfectly normal for teenagers to have very negative experiences (and perhaps all-too-human-human-acts-of-Valhalla) in which teenagers usually ended up worse for the wear. Then she rethought that statement and thought, not doing things right, taking things out

Eternity’s face slipped up into a scowl as he began to sweat profusely. It was the stupidest thing he’d ever heard. He had a glorious idea: if this was going to be a contest, he might as well go ahead and pull off the impossible, too.

			Quentin imagined what a brilliant, dizzying display this would be. He imagined how the acrobat’s fall stack up with a soaring, uninterrupted spiral, like the crescent moon rising from the sand. He imagined how the acrobats would spin impossibly quick triangles of electricity, like a chandelier spinning impossibly slowly over a person. He would pivot in mid-routine, anticipate the acrobats, predict his moves flawlessly, have the chandelier bounce back off their fragile surface, then whip around, spin around, spin around—all in one fluid movement. It would be cathartic, and terrifying at the same time.

			But no, that couldn’t have been what he’d in mind. It couldn’t possibly work. It would be like Hasidic Voltaire coming back from the dead. The odds were stacked so heavily in his favor that it almost sounded like a skill he’d picked from a casting that he’d never seen, but he was determined to find out for ourselves.

			He looked at his watch. Three minutes. He♾d be late, he thought, and if he did make it in time they’d expel him at dawn. He locked the door and turned on the water.

			It was a lot easier than he’d thought. It was not at all like being inside a ventriloquist’s box.

			There was a vent in the floor, or at least a shower of them. He made his way over to it, cautiously, his hands shaking a little. The walls were lined with racks and racks of these weird lead-colored metal dishes that looked like they were made of smooth lead but acted like they were made of any other metal, save for a couple of tiny magnets which were obviously for some reason supposed to carry the aroma of some sort. They were very heavy—he was going to have to get some that were smaller and lighter—and very slippery. When he got there the shower of dishes stopped and he

Eternity (2009), a retrospective which consisted of sixty minutes of interviews with his late collaborator, the late Roland Barthes; it is a kind of man-shortcut, a detour from the labyrinths of experience, a kind of prefiguration of his glorious coming.

Together and apart, they compose the history of science: Barthes with his skepticism concerning the reality of the world; Hume with his monism concerning the nature of mind; Barthes with his ontology which he terms "the science of minds"; Hook with his dichotic ontology; Hume with his absolute mind. The documentary continues: "The history of ideas, in other words, is the history of the first understanding, which is the origin of all other histories." The documentary ends with the quotation from Plato of Galen's words "All men are acting gods in them."

In all these exchanges, there are no contradictions. Everyone is acting as he knows he must, for the most part, but there are also some beautiful moments, too, when everyone stands up and takes responsibility for himself. For example, when I ask Julianos, a colleague of mine on the philosophy department, about Barthes's notion of the "heart's content," he replies, with obvious mildness, "I don't know. That's a straw man. I guess I never studied it." When I ask him his take on Alvin Planting's Cosmological Imperative, he answers simply, "I don't believe in it." When I point out to him the emptiness of Berkeley's "all men are soulless automatons," he tells me that "Berkeley was an automaton, but he was no less moved by it than I was."

When I ask him his take on David Hume's Reflections, I see a man who has experienced and continually will experience the Force; I see a man who has seen and always will see God. "I don't believe in God," he says simply.

These are not sentimental answers. We Greeks believe in a supreme mind which animated all things and governs all men; this mind created everything and rules over all; everywhere and under every theme it is present, there and now, it rules " everywhere and under every theme it is present, there and now. I see a society; I participate;

“The Land of Bats and Bottlenose Men’’s Poems.”

			The pink-skinned one held a placard that said It’s Your Right, Queen of the Queens of the Land of Bats and Bottlenose Men. The other pink-skinned one held a placard that said No. The mute one wore a mask. They both stood together, facing the door to the warehouse in perfect perfect alignment.

			“And now, the big reveal!” The pink one said. The others listened evenly.

			The reveal was that they were playing a game. The one who spoke first received a prize. The game: they wanted to know what the hell the hell it was that people did all the time for a living.

			“What the hell are we going to do?” Plum said. Nobody answered.

			“We have to tell you something,” the mute one said. “The land you’re from isn’t the real land.”

			“The hell do you know?” the pink one said. “It isn’t the real Queen’s-Land.”

			“It isn’t,” the mute one snapped. “It isn’t your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather’s-Land!”

			A second later the answering angels came banging at the door. One, two, three.

			“What did you do?” Eliot said. He had time to wonder before the third one barked out a warning laugh: it was the mute one.

			“What are you doing here?” the pink one said. “Are you the one who yelled at the girls?”

			The warning from the first two had been audible through the door for a long, long time, and it stirred in Eliot like a thousand ghosts. It was the first time he’d felt something like love—since he could remember.

Eternity.

There is a book in a wood — a medieval work, perhaps, but the wood is burned down every summer, or never really existed at all: the wood tells the history of an age, but the age doesn’t want to share it. The book is the Will to Power, a secret draft of an encyclopedia written by men who never read one another, men who neither read nor write nor Dharma nor magic. The men of the wood write in runes:

∜When death comes, when the world ends, I shall stand at the door and answer thee.

When death does not come, with all his disciples, Juan Francisco Pizarro (one of the Martí fútbols) will enter the room where his father died. He will see his father again, he will see his mother, he will see his great-grandfather, who also died young, who also, once, had two doors. He will recognize the room from his father’s house. He will know that his father died in the house from which he had fled so many times.

When the years have flown by, when disputes and anxieties and chicanery will take their toll, when the earth listens for his steps, when the years sink like stone on a hot sand, when Juan Francisco Pizarro will see his father stand before the locked door, with his face burned with rage, with a bowl of food in his hand, with a metal spoon still in his mouth, with a .38 revolver at his side, with a-ha! one hit and the bullet had left his head, one hit and he was dead.

I will close this poem with a quotation from Tlön by means of which we are all children again:




Parable of the Good and the Evil

A wise man said to his son:

"Son, where there is good, there is also pain; where there is pain, there is also pleasure; where there is pleasure, there is also wisdom; where there is wisdom, there is peace."

The son answered:

"Peace, indeed, thy wisdom I would greatly desire."

He prayed:

"God to share with me my pains and reward thy goodness for my suffering."

Then the wise man blessed him and said to him:

2. This number, it will be noted, also includes two essays by Lord to the effect that there is not one book in the universe, but rather many books, one after another, like curling trophies. This finding will be of some help to those who think of large-scale disapprobation of certain words; for such a word is included in the vocabulary of countless books, for it is a synonym of every corner, leaf, grain of sand or marble idol ever made. Lord, in the ninth chapter of his Metaphysics, denies, with the eloquent Paracelsus, that the world is the collection of particles or of attributes; he denies, instead, that any one of these collections is comprehensive, as is the case in the works of Aristotle and in the Divinity. In other words, Lord denies, in the course of a nearly continuous argument, a point on which the traditional Thelems are based.

3. The doctrine of the Trinity is not new; it is the terminology by which it is being expounded and the philosophy of which it is the logical dialectical proof. The doctrine of the Trinity is simple, timeless, and does not admit any foundation in Scripture or in tradition. It is opposed, consequently, not to Scripture but to metaphysics.

Eternity, or at least the immediate future, is here a matter of some controversy. It is commonplace to speak of an age of "Eternity," as if it were a fixed fixed, absolute, and all-pervading reality. But this would be an absurdity, for the denial of eternity would mean denying the universe; for the denial of the universe, a world of eternity; for the denial of the universe, a world of ages.

It is more reasonable to speak of a "Time-House," a house in which all things happen at one and the same time. This would mean that all our past moments are one and eternal; that all our present moments are likewise; that our hopes, fears, in the midst of these countless things, really constitute the Time-House. This is the traditional view.

Others think that the passage from Eclogues surmonched by Fontenelle is not the most probable. That would be an absurdity, for absurdity is the case with respect to all things; but it would be even more absurd to speak of a single, absolute, state of things. For that to be the case, there must exist something, other than I, which is the author of all moments. I, whose handwriting created the sheets of paper, of all those moments, which one day brought forth the image of a man and not of a horse.

The Mirror of Enigmas



The idea that the universe is a chaos or hallucination, that it is the work of some higher intelligence than our own, has been recurrent in philosophy since the ancient philosophers. Spengler, in his rationalasitas, speak of a "philosophies of man" which are at variance with reality; Hume, with propriety, distinguishes two spheres of experience: that of the visible world, which is characterized by the abiding impressions it causes on the mind, and that of the invisible world, which is characterized by the effects which no visible object can efface. The former are real, the latter indispensable to our life, but they do not wholly characterize the world. We can observe that the world around us always contains something real, since we can behold it even when we are asleep; but we cannot say what it is that sees, or what is the thing that sees. A Schwartzeiger, at the foot of a mountain, might observe that its real
====================
Eternity, the dream of a thousand and one moons.

The Sorrows of Young Werther by Hermann Hoepfer (1895)
This is a classic work of postmodern literature, and the title text is a riff on Hoepfer's equally classic book. The story concerns a man who is given many lifetimes to live, yet is doomed to lose them all at the touch of a key. The reader is Hoepfer's narrator, a man who has had all his possessions carefully catalogued and numbered, with their prices and use numbers. The process has begun: the series of deaths that follows ends with the death of the narrator's grandfather, who has passed away, but not before having spent years piecing together the tragedy that is to become his final death. In order to complete the tragedy, his great-grandfather, who has already died, will also die, but Hoepfer doesn't worry about this second death, since it won't have any part in the total. Since all that matters in the end is that the narrator dies, the narrator must have had a lot of help along the way, and none of it matters to him: he dies trying to murder a schoolteacher from Bruges, and then goes on to kill her multiple times, all while her children watch them, and then he goes on to murder her four more times, and then his own family member, and then finally himself. It is through this horror called life that Hoepfer triumphantly sums up the case: "The noblest thing a man can do is to kill a woman."

The Leibstandarte by Hermann L.K.Georgiadis is another work that might be translated literally and literally it so happened not to be. The title literally means "The Library of Lost Books"; the story is one of desperate reading, in which an older man (played by Georges Meret) comes to terms with the loss of his father's library in the suburbs of Paris. The loss becomes not only an onslaughts of the memory, but also of a kind of obsession. The film version of the book (translated by M.L. Kahn) gives the following explanation: "The term fathers holds for all lifetimes; the Library of Lost Books is no exception. The balance of the centuries has restored these books to the custody of the medieval master, who in turn entrusted them to a new generation
====================
Eternity and the End of the World in Eighteen Chapters" in the Encyclopedia of Delphinidae.

The important thing is that the doctrine is universal, that is, that it is found in all the major philosophical schools, that it is intelligible to all men and that it can be explained by it. I have indicated that the hypothesis of an absolute timbre of language (as postulating by Bruno and Spengler and entertained by Spengler again and again in a dream) is absurd. But the idea that the languages we use have no other essential characteristic than that of being able to say "I am here X" is perhaps more tenuous. In the Indus Valley Civilization the idea was that all men are contained in a single god, the divine Ram, the divine Umar, the divine Ashtar, the divine Enoch, the divine Job, the divine Job's father, the divine Flood, creation of the world, the primordial fragmentation of the world, the repetition of the primordial fragmentation, the generation of the world, the generation of the world. Each of these ideas was analyzed by at least one Indian metaphysician, possibly in turn analyzed by many. Each philosophical school in turn had its Pythagoreans, its Advaita traditions, its Buddhists and its Post-Buddhisms. Each philosophical school came to accept as valid the statements of its predecessor and the heresy of its predecessor came to be accepted as legitimate by each of its branches. It is very curious that the most absolute expressions of human experience should be those which havearousenomic structure.

In the final analysis, all philosophical investigations are the application of reason to experience. Reason, as I have indicated, is an excellent faculty, but it is an atrocious ability to which we are naturally prone. We naturally prefer to think and to reason abstractly, and we naturally prefer the thought to that which is expressed. However, with the application of reason to a problem specific to our experience, we are naturally incapable of that thought, and we naturally attain to the object to which reason is applied. The result is an atrocious inconsistency: the absurd, the same thing, many things, many problems, one issue, one issue and one issue. Of what avail is it to think of "I am here X" or "I am here Z" when we are already aware of "I am here X" or "I am here Z"? And how
====================
Eternity and eternal life, but a mere dynamic succession of equilibria. This could be demonstrated only by an ecstasy of thought.

The next object which the patient perceived was that of a library. The first shelves were those of the digital divinity, whose digital significance seemed amply justified by the illiteracy and depravity of the pages. The objective form of the library ― the greatest antiquity, the most ancient authors, the most ancient languages ― seemed to him an insoluble problem. At first he was not able to perceive the proper title of the establishment he formed, but then he decided to call it after some authority who had expounded its principles. His first library was published in four editions, in four languages, in two or three hemispheres. Each of these libraries contained, for a certain period of time, all the works of the preceding one. This fact, considered in isolation (as it at first seemed to Marcel Leopold Hugo), did not produce such an effect. Enchanted by its novelty, he wished to produce a larger and more lasting one. He felt the need of a specialized name; he imagined that the proper title of his establishment ― the Eleanor or Advocate ― was sufficient. He considered the improper name of his book: the Book of Titles. He realized that it would be a name that would be universal, that it would include not only the most ancient languages but also all the scripts of the earth. Thus the problem was solved. In a prophetic voice he said: ―

"I have finally created a name. It is a word which, at the name of an object, is capable of naming it. This word is not a translation of the known, a mere obstructive mask, but a new name which will allow itself to be recognized. I call it Titles, out of all the books that exist, so that every one of you may know and understand it."

Then he unfolded his eyes: he opened them wide and sprinkled sand on them. Then he took out a little file, which was his index finger; then he played with it, as if it were a file. Immediately a book appeared, immediately another one, and it was necessary to edit several versions of it. At the entrance to the entryway he bowed low, as if in supplication. Then he opened the first volume and saw a bald prophet ― anagram ― on the second floor speaking good English, studying scriptural verses with

Eternity was not a level in the game.

“Even now I should not have said it, but it is true: the entire alphabet is anagrams. Pronunciation is another matter.”

“Oh, so you’re saying that the runes of Fillory are written in human blood?”

rency

“No, not in human blood. The Norvegians write their own alphabet,” Julia said, not in bad faith, “which is somewhat closer to that of the human tongue than any other language the world has to offer.”

rency

“So you are saying that Ember is an anagram of the word fire?”

rency

“I would say that, yes.”

rency

“So Ember is derived from the Turkish word for burning, and you’d better believe that I am going to have lard for a cooktop in case Ember ever got around to cooking something fire.”

rency

“Well, Ember is also an anagram of damn,” Julia said, in her normal, if somewhat sarcastic, fashion. “So you could say it is divinely anagramic.”

rency

“I know,” Julia said, “but it’s a good spell. I did a bit of Googling myself, and it seems that none of the predecessors of our own have been able to come up with anything like it. It is, I think, a modern invention.”

rency

“Do you think it’s harmless?”

rency

“I don’t know.” A little annoyed, I opened my mouth to reply. “I don’t think Julia should have a job dealing with stupid women. Or children. Or fire. Or lard. Or Fergus. Or lizards. Or fire in anything. Do you?”

rency

“Well, I don’t know. Maybe it’s just not my thing.”

rency

We were both silent for a long time, minute after minute, second by agonized minute, watching the clock. Then Julia, in her way as a woman would, downed the whisky.

The countenancing looked on, his eyes narrowed. They knew that they were about to be spectators of an enormous show, many minutes long, repeated ad infinitum, and they hesitated, uncertain whether to respond with respectful obedience and confidence, or with an imperceptible terror. One response would have confirmed them all; they all but gave their utterance, since utterance would have been an affirmation of their nameless fate.

A Thousand Plateauxs

Averroe, on the Continent



My love,

I write to you from a country house in the Aventine district of Florence. I am not your father, your brother, or your ancestor; I am not even my great-grandfather. I am your neighbor, separated by a wall and surrounded by a network of petty streets. I am not handsome, I scarcely entertain visitors. I am not related to any of you by blood, but rather by that long and complicated common accent which is not Italian and which is not French. I write thus, so that in the distant city I may contribute to the discussions of this house and in Florence itself. I have traversed this vast and costly desert, but my steps have not been feeble. I have encountered God and his creature, and I have broken His covenant. Surely I have not done what you, my friends, have done, and wrote tragedies in an antechamber. Indeed, I believe that this very solitude has been the praiseworthy trait of your works. . . I know that you often entertain the vain hope of inspiring your readers with a single fancy. I share that anxiety and think that by an act of generosity you have also aided that anxiety. I write to you, Ceder-bishop, in the courtyard of a rented house, in the house of a lay confessor and abbot, where you are not unable to reach

Eternity, the Final Eternity, was the word of that invisible Being which no man or language could define or explain. It was the vibration of the Ceaser, the echo of that final explosion which shook the world and was still settling. It was the early dawn of the new age, the light of the new lamp, but it was all night and all ice and all winds. It was the lake of mangoes and the desert of stars.











The Sect of the Phoenix



Teuton. Ts'ui Pê, ―" ― wrote to me from the island of Samos, ―"

In what order shall I tell you about it?

We at Ts'ui Pê believe in one God, founded in a cloud on a cloud, who founded the world in a fire on a fire, who founded the universe in a stilling of the waters on a stilling of the winds on a stilling of the waves on a yelling of the gale, who founded the archangels who keep watch over the universe and who founded the first man, ―Teuton. ―Teuton. ―Teuton. ―Teuton. ―Teuton. ―Teuton. ―Teuton. ―Teuton.

Teuton. Ts'ui Pê, ―" ― wrote to me from Ts'ui Pê, on 11 June (the day after your visit), ―

From ―Alice to ―Teuton.

We understand each other.

We wish to point out that your visit to Ts'ui Pê is not accidental. We were ordered to prepare a theory of the universe, which we have performed with the singular propriety of being physicians. We never cease asking the gods for medicines, incense, books ―anything ―that we can use in religion. We have obtained books of this kind from the property of the Ts'ui Po, ―― the great sultan of Ts'ui Pê. They are volumes in four volumes, ―― the fifth volume being a revision of the second. We believe that the universe is cyclic. The first five volumes prove it; the third and the second prove that the universe commences with the appearance of the gods. The third and the second prove that the gods are identical with the gods; the fourth proves, perhaps, that the gods are identical with ourselves. The Ts'ui Po has given us three hundred years of science
====================
Eternity/temporal, the opposite is also true: there is no such thing, not even in space. If you look at a night sky, you will see stars, but no planet. If you look at it from the side, as I have been doing here, you will see that it curves around the rim, that is to say, it curves clockwise from the east and counterclockwise from the west. If you turn your face to the east, you will see the Great Wall of China; if to the west, the Yala. In the same way, there is no such thing as the Great Wall of China; neither is there the Tiremi nor the Book of the Dead. Both these are impossible. The universe, then, is a mistake or trick; one of the illusions or snares of the mind."

"But if time is a lie, what hope remains for the human race?"

"The human race has only one hope: that of Jesus Christ."

"But Jesus Christ is a phantom," I replied.

"A phantom, yes; an absurdity, perhaps, but an absurdity nonetheless."

These were the words of one of the most daring and sincere of the Buddhists, the One, the Tathagatas, who was equally silent as to the veracity or non-truthfulness of his supplications. In the last analysis, I can say this: if time is a phantom, what hope is there for mankind except that of Jesus Christ, who pleads with the Father and the Hours in vain and dies for all time to prove his faith? Nothing short of the coming to power and happiness of Jesus of Nazianz-Areopagus and the miracle of His death, which is not in vain, but which man could wello perfecto. And no wonder: the things we really are, the works we really have, the many sufferings and luxuries of this world, are the work of an omnipotent being, just as the great and humble artificer who did the universe is our God. All men's dreams and hallucinations are but delusions, so long as there is some such being to whom we can ascribe the name of Time.

Thus have I wandered over the interlacing of these two vast and noble books; I have not wandered so far from the straight and narrow that my God must directly and immediately and ubiquitously and ubiquitously and
====================
Eternity is the intention of the mind, which in its ideal world, if not infinite, yet certainly infinitely complex. It is impossible to speak of an infinite period of time. We can say, with A, that there was one sensation of the blue triangle; we can say, with B, that no other triangle was experienced by that person; we can do the same for any other triangle. We shall be able to say, with respect to each one of them, "It is blue" or "It is red." We shall know in what state it was in the spectator's mind at the moment of perception; we shall know in advance what the mind was; we shall know in advance the number of sides, the number of angles, the ratio of its corners to its sides, the area of its hypotenuse, the area of its circle. These properties do not exist in space; they are the property of numbers which accrue parallel to the curve of a number; they are a relation which we may evaluate in space. The triangle which we saw is a perfectly homogeneous representation of one triangle; its blue numerator and denominator are known to us; we may compare the two by means of a mirror; we shall see that the numerator and denominator coincide with those of the triangle. Now, I venture to say, not one of these properties is found in the triangle; rather, they are the numbers of its exterior. In the case of the triangle, the fact that the number which constitutes the triangle is known to us and allows us to compare it with other numbers, is a fact sufficient for us to determine the form of the divine triangle. If, then, the mind is an infinite number of points, it is true that it is an infinite number of things which can be conceived as resembling it; it is also true that there is a part of it which no one has ever seen, nor wants to see; this is a fact sufficient for us to determine the nature of the triangle.

Let us now consider one particular representation of the triangle. The face on the card is the same as that on the card with the red and white stripes; it is, however, represented by a triangle whose four corners do not lie along those of the stripes. This triangle, representing the red and white triangle, is the object of the Will. (It is equally true that the triangle was previously mere fashion and that the author of the Will intended it to have that
====================
Eternity (1998)). The notion of an infinite tape is by no means new; it has been formulated by Spinoza (Enchy)|Enchy z zeculae, section IV; it has also been formulated by Russell (The Godhead and the Universe: a logical exposition of Descartes, section VIII), Mackie (God, the Holy Trinity and the Sphere, chapter six of Principia Mathematica, part two, part one, section V), Ramsey (Treatise of Human Knowledge, chapter four, line twenty-five), Berkeley (System of a Fixed Code, par. twenty), Zwingli (Principles of Information, par. thirty-three), and Nietzsche (The Gay of Flanders, quoted in Zangwill, Oxford, auxiliary, 1900, points four and five). Berkeley conceived of the world as a continuous process of repeated "images" (Nietzsche, Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, II, I, 81); Russell conceived of it as a continuous state of "intelligible things" (op. cit., I, 6); Nietzsche conceived of it as a succession of "momentary" (and, hence, ephemeral) "images" (op. cit., I, 14); each of these interpretations is leavened by theological variants. Berkeley's is by means of the doctrine of relativity a fide Christian doctrine; Russell's by a priori reasoning; Berkeley's by the doctrine of necessary connections; Russell's by the thesis that every image is necessarily distinct; each of these fictions is derived from the other by a process of inspiration (Berkeley, Institutes, lecture XXVI, lines 32-33). All these fictions make a virtue of their formal simplicity, but they lack the vital force which would make them valuable as speeches or essays. Theiralready acknowledged epigrams attest the high standard of that time; what is new is that the writers have attained to the size and variety of works of higher literature. The problem of a vocabulary is hardly new (Shakir, Manual, II, 158f.). The novelty is that the vocabulary has attained the stature of an immortal thing, attainst the lofty goal of describing the universe, and at the same time owe their recall to treatises on a specific subject. The doctrine of necessary connections is ingenious, but treatises on interconnected themes are common. A Platonic gloss on a theme of common occurrence would be delightful,

			“I do not know. A few good cards and I could be out of here in about ten minutes. If I ever did find you I would let you know.”

			“I know where I’m going,” Pushkar said. “I know why I’m doing this.”

			“Well why hide it now?”

			The old goblin looked like he was having a hard time sorting out his emotions.

			“I know why I’m doing this.” He said, “I’m a highlander king. I lead a great house and a kingdom and I want what is rightfully mine. I’m a civilized person now and I don’t think I ever wanted it what it is. I used to believe in the old ways. I used to believe in you and your ways. I used to

Eternity and Hell, as it were.

			“You know,” he said, “we could go back and try to kill Alice. Maybe with a little more magic.”

			“Magic? Magic for killing people?” Plum was frowning. “What kind of magic?”

			“Nothing you can throw at them.”

			“But magic for anything?” Eliot frowned. “Nothing thatCCCマー magic—”

			“EH!” Plum waved her arms.

			“Um, no! Not magic for nothing! I mean,” she spluttered, embarrassed, “magic for doing a little magic when Alice was down!”

			“She was a hell of a magician,” Quentin said.

			“But she was a hell of a magician only for a long, long time. Years.”

			Alice was right, long ago. But she had been a hell of a lot more than a magician for she could do a lot with a lot of stones and a lot of magic words and a lot of energy and a lot of luck. Alice could do what he couldn’t? That was the question.

			“What I can do is work with magic,” she said. “And with energy.”

			“I can.”

			“And a bit of luck.”

			“And a bit of energy.”

			“And a bit of time.”

			“And a bit of Parnell,” Quentin said. “The Prince of the Storm.”

			“He is a cousin,” Alice said.

			“He’s not,” Quentin said. “You’re not.”

			It was funny, watching them struggle to keep themselves from toppling over. Life was funny, funny funny. But this was different. This was what they were fighting for. It was funny, this whole adventure, all of it, all at once, like a freight train smashinghead on the tracks to a
====================
Eternity. The Peace.

			“Do you think we’ll get there?” Plum asked. “I mean, I know science, but I’m a doctor too. I got—"

			“The mind,” the bird said. “All you have is your mind. You could be a wizard or a parapsychologist or a lobotomy or a lobotomy yourself. You could be a time traveler or precognition or precognition from a century in the future. We’ve got all the time in the world, and we’d all just use it instead of a minute and a half of it. You know that.”

			It felt weird to talk about it to a bird, but it turned out the talk had an effect. Plum’s shoulders dropped; she felt slightly nauseated by the suggestion that things had actually gone south, but they hadn’t turned up to negotiate value for value, and she was particularly unqualified to speak on her client’s behalf. She was better off back in Brakebills, where she was doing legal research. She could take a weeks-long break.

			She decided instead that they should pretend they hadn’t happened. They’d built a promising relationship, and something had changed in him since that first afternoon in the hotel bar. Things had changed a great deal in his short life, but something had also changed in theirs, and now was the right moment for them to change too. They were broke, and they were desperate, and he knew it, and he didn’t care anymore. He could feel the difference.

			But he didn’t just want to go back; he wanted to go back to when he was a chief executive, dragging his dad with him on one leg, on to the big screen in Isstopia, showing off his fancy new Airbus A320 to the hottest new crop of space royalty. He could still dream big. He pushed past his queasy self to the top of the emotional heap.

			The bird didn’t resist. It picked up the phone and began playing the tape of their earlier conversation, more and more loudly, the parts that Janet hadn’t understood, the parts where he was talking about how much he’d changed, and
