			“The cards have to be colored. You can’t just have black and white.”

			“But I’m not black or white! I’m two!” It was a girl’s voice, more like 13 or 14 years old. “I’m Plum!”

			Nobody answered him.

			“What is it?” Plum asked.

			“It’s been a long time!” It was the first girl’s voice. “It was a long time ago! It was you who gave me the spell!”

			“That’s true. But you don’t remember anything else.” It was the second girl’s voice. “It was you, Eliot, taking us to the Riviera in the 1960s!”

			“I remember that,” the third voice said. It was a girl. “You’re not a memory, you are a voice now.”

			The cards started coming in. Folktales, half-fanciful tales, the like. The music was nice and the intercom worked. The food was good. Quentin wasn’t much of a eater, but it was good to be alive, and this place was sort of solving some basic nutritional problem for him. He was regaining some control over his weight.

			“I ate them all,” he said. “They’re right there.”

			Quentin began working on his own cards. They were funny, maybe a bit on the silly side—jokes about birds finding sandwiches in pigeon holes—but they were tricks up the sleeves. He could have let them sit in the fridge untried and not try and push them through until they were perfect. They were the kind of tricks he had to learn on his own.

			He was careful to point out the nutritional value of the wild plants around him, tips of exotic food items he had grown himself, all clearly labeled and arranged in neat rows and colums. He only ate what he needed, what he wanted, when he wanted. Sometimes he would buy two or three things, but
====================
Cells, like atoms, have a definite position and a fluid content, but they also have an infinite number of potential states. A strong electric field can cause a cell to be into one possible state, as in the image at the top; if we added an infinite length of conductive tape to the field, we would have a mirror, or a fiber-optic cable, whose behavior would be the same. We could also apply an extremely strong magnetic field to the fiber-optic cable, and lo and behold the fiber-optic state would be the same as when the field was absent. If we added an infinite amount of conductive tape to the fiber, we should have a mirror like the one at the top, but since there would be an infinite number of possible optical states (since there is no fixed physical object without an intrinsic awareness of its intrinsic nature). The behavior of the fiber-optic cable is not determined by its intrinsic state, since after an infinite looping universe, it would arrive at the present state (or, more precisely, its current frame) in every possible frame.

This very strong field described by potential states could be used to simulate the behavior of the universe, but it is extremely expensive to construct. A quantum computer would run into this same problem—it is quite easy to make a computer, modify it, make it smaller, make it faster, etc. But a quantum computer would have to simulate the behavior of an infinitely small computer, with the potential states of all the bits in it. Even a programmable computer, with infinite resources, would be of limited use for practical purposes. A computer with one bit of information could be used to compute the date, but not to solve the Rubiksdarya problem. A computer with one bit of information could be used to solve the Rubiksdarya problem, but not to think about it. A computer with one bit of information could be used to solve the Rubiksdarya problem, but not to confuse yourself with its potential applications. A computer with one bit of information could be used to solve the Rubiksdarya problem, but not to weave yourself out of it. A computer with one bit of information could be used to weave yourself out of it. A computer with one bit of information could be used to weave yourself out of it. A computer with one bit of information could be used to be infinite, but not infinite in the right places. A computer

Cells of light, slightly reflective, glowed in their sockets. In the middle was a long window with a tapestry display of various birds and animals on it.

			“I am the Great Ripper,” Eliot said. “And I am pleased to see you,” he said it slowly, with a Southern Charm accent. “Come in.”

			The parrot didn’t want to. It came closer, feeling his firm right hand, enjoying the touch. Eliot was in black with a light walnut color scheme, with dark horizontal stripes of white trim running down the sides, and white trim down the center. He had on a black collared shirt and black pants, and he looked like the sort of person who worth their salt would wear any pair of boxers they owned in a heartbeat over a weapon of some kind, whether it was a bat, a knife, a gun, a gunk.

			There was a model of bird on the end of a string; Eliot reached over and unfolded the clasp. The parrot didn’t turn its head, but it didn’t resist either—it simply stood there, dumb, as if waiting for us to do something it knew it couldn’t do now.

			“OK,” I said. “OK.”

			Right. I got this.

			“You want a nickel, right?”

			Right.

			“Cash or nothing, I’m coming.”

			We took the train. I didn’t have to explain anything, and honestly I wasn’t, not without a lot of trepidation. And while I was here I figured I ought to at least give you guys a little taste of what it was like.

			We left the Old Manor at nine thirty and went back a half hour later. You could tell Ember suggested we go a little faster than normal. I thought the tempo would be a little fast, a couple of hundred kilometres an hour, which would be fairly unremarkable. You can have a little taste of the country when you’re in first-class.

 Severian IV, Against the Deacon of Arrian's Critics (Basle, 1893), I, 615.

 Cistercian theologians, after deducting all the miracles of the world, arrive at the following deduction, which has recently had the approval of the holy See: Every Christian is under the obligation to confess and to regenerate every one of his Lord's people. This obligation, as already said, is indisputable; it can be evaded by the diversion of the individual from the Lord; but an indissoluble union with the Son is more difficult. Cajetan observes that in all diverse acts of faith, "the Lutheran, the Copernican, the Aristotelian, the Thomistic," assume a subservient or auxiliaries role. They perform the necessary work, he says, but not the one completed by St. Paul, by John of Paderborn, by Jesus, by God. Augustine, speaking of the world as a theater where arts are revealed, employs a somewhat disparaging term, since it is applied to religious acts. He writes: Arts are made manifest, and what is manifest is that which the anthems and hymns announce. There is a theater, a theater, a theater, a subterranean temple. (Historiae de corpus christi, I, 852) I have spoken of John of Paderborn; compare also his work Annales catholicae, where it is said that he founded the orders of the clergy; in fact, he did not establish any such orders. Augustine attributes to Jesus the revealing of the universe. But what does it reveal, precisely, if not that the universe is revealing itself? If the universe is an art, how can it possibly be terrible? If the universe is sublime, how dreadful can it be? Tlön isht-card reads: I honor the universe. John of Paderborn corrected this: I honor the universe. . . Archelaus of Berenice wrote: I honor the universe. These words are cogent, yet they contradict each other. On the one hand, they reveal a callow admiration for the vast and insignificant microcosm; an admiration which is universal and which does not require a universal interpretation. On the other hand, they contradict each other, they speak of a man who honors the universe and a universe which is reverent to him.

I go onto say that, in the last analysis, there is no danger whatever in the practice of philological criticism. It is not difficult to formulate in words and to define in words the vague sensations produced by the variations and combinations of thought. The problems which confront us are not technical; they are not pertaining to the derivation of an alphabet from the combinations of the stars; they are irrecoverable. We are dealing with the essence of things; we are dealing with the assumptive intuition that this intuition is true. Criticism is the perception and the discombination of intuitions. To deal with the cognoscenti is to become tacit, chaste and base; to strike upon the intuitions is to illumine the very heart of the objector.

Here it is my wont (I know, now I write) to speak with the exclamation point; heretics should not preach the exclamation point's supremacy; heretics should speak of how their colleague or that of another faith overcomes paralyzing cobwebs (tears) in order to proclaim the opus in a mirror. I have seen how the conqueror's symbol cleaves the blind; I know how the image of a dead and trembling Peter can break down barriers and allow the faithful to reach the place where the history of the universe began. I know how the Jew's five-pointed star can cause schisms and shake the foundations of Babylon. I know how so many icons have perished in battles and how it was I who, in a letter to the Romans, destroyed five of them. I know how, on three occasions, the face of Christ had its symbol cut out and another one (that of the eagle) had one of its talons. I know that the virgin who with many groans pleaded her case in four walls of fire was protected by symbols of that same pain. I know that the Isidore of Cusa was followed by monsters and that of the Virgin of Guadalquivir seven sons and seven daughters were enough to form a terrifying and convincing monster. I know that among the Celts, the chief spirit was the warrior, that among the Bavarians, the cross. . . I know that among the Lombards, the heresiarch, that demon who represented the many and that singularly the many. I know that among the English, the outlaw, that hangman who in a baritone echoed in the most

			“I’m not sure that there are any wheels in Fillory,” Eliot admitted.

			“There should be,” Quentin said. “But they’re not turning up.”

			“I’m not sure what you’re looking for,” Plum said.

			“Not what I expected,” Eliot said.

			“I thought you’d like the beach,” Plum said.

			She sounded bored, like she was doing more than being bored with herself. Poor Plum. Quentin tried to imagine her back on the island. Back at Brakebills. Back on Earth.

			He wondered where she’d been, what she’d needed, what her family did, and he held up a finger for her to respond.

			“…?” she said. “What did you do?”

			This time he got a response.

			“I left. I don’t know what I did, but I left.”

			She was trying to get up, but never did she dare. Her body was refusing to go through the motions.

			“And you still don’t know, did you? Did you ever really try to ask me that?”

			“I—”

			“You didn’t try. I SEE you trying.”

			“I don’t know what I was thinking, but I can’t think anything right now. At all.”

			“That’s okay,” Quentin said. “Now you do.”

			With those words he made her laugh. She clamped her jaw and sent out faint acoustic blasts, and he knew she was enjoying this. It made her a bit more human, at least.

			“So how did you miss it all?”

			“The coast is clear,” she said. “As far as I know.”

Cells and circles. He closed his eyes and tried to remember what a lifespout was, but he could not. A lifetime of anticipation and anticipation and more anticipation ended up squandering it. What was he going to do? What could he do?

			Something came to him during that time. It came from somewhere he could not see, but which was always watching him, large and attentive and alert, waiting for someone to make a move. It was a deep, hungry, awkward feeling that did not leave his gut and he knew that it was what all self-conscious people went through when they had not made a move and all people went to when they were going to move on: anorexic envy. It was a relief. It was something he had to fight.

			It was hard to explain. It was a feeling you got when you were getting by, when you were starving, and you realized you were starving because you couldn’t eat as good as somebody else. You’d be sitting there thinking, God, I really am sooooo close to that, when in fact it really isn’t that close. It wasn’t until you were sitting on a desert island with nothing but your bare feet on it and nothing but the sand between your legs that you really felt that way.

			That’s what it felt like. For a few minutes it went on like this for a while, and then it stopped going on, and for a while it felt like forever. Quentin thought it might be forever, but Croaker didn’t.

			That was all it took. The world around them darkened and lost its color, the night became a slow twilight, and the night grew lighter. For a long time after that it was the most beautiful thing in the world.

			But it wasn’t like anything he’d ever seen before. He had dark, abstract dreams, but this was something he’d never seen before. It was different. It was more real. Something had come over him that night, and it was interfering with everything he’d ever believed.

			He was so afraid of what the future might hold. He was so afraid that if he came back to Fillory his present self would destroy him in a futile act of self-defense. But it was too soon to think about that

Later I learned that, before the duel, the people of Long Island had burned the manuscript of the Ovid against the Humber, because it is impossible to recite the words in a pure and admirable manner without accent or without being affected by the following adjective: á illegible! Or, again: If the Ovid is a poem and the words are the outlines of a dream, what is the Thoth to the Homer? I do not know, but I do know that, since that time, all those who abhor poetry have reverenced the Thoth, and that the unfeigned reverence which the ignorant pay the starry and material world is a sin which the righteous would never forget.

The Zahir



The Zahir is one of those questions which anyone who has once been through a vision or who has ever been under the sway of an irresistible imagination can pose; it is an impossible construct, interwoven notions which, like the plot of a nightmare, spring up in the head-courses of sleep and then, unable to hold, split asunder by the waking eye. It is this very scenario which the critics assail with vehemence; I think I have solved it once before and that was in describing the intricate tapestry which made up the history of the loin- in Egyptian costume.

I have already mentioned the arguments which this critique deplores. First, it attributes the invention of the Zahir to Mohammed, in order to deride. Second, it attacks the Zahir as an invective against Islam, when in fact it is an invective against the imagination of Muhammad. Third, it attacks the sentence which describes the history of the loin- in costume, when in fact it is the same thing, an invective against the sentence and an epithet of the sentence.

All these invectives are pernicious; all these cloudy adjectives are the fruit of inarticulate fears; all these vague allusions to the "planning and designing" of the loin-in

Cells of light, which seemed to double in number. And at the end of it, in the middle of the last one, there was nothing. The only sounds were the rustling leaves and the drip of rain on the roof.

			“What happened to it?” Plum said. “It could have run away. It could have run away from the world. It didn’t want to be alive.”

			“No. It ran itself into the ground, or into the dawn.”

			Quentin stared at the ground. It was a lovely earth, richly brown and tan, with a sea of gray rocks spelling out THE END. It was a barren, black beach, the color of crushed gravel. There was nothing there that wasn’t in Fillory, nowhere between. He looked at Plum.

			“Fillory,” she said. “We’re going to the Neitherlands outside of Castle Whitespire. This is where the two armies fighting against each other die. We’re going to see what it’s like to be an inhabitant there.”

			He was going to be the first visitor in a long while.

			“I know.” But he was also a little skeptical. What were the Neitherlands like? Back in the nineteenth century, they were an old English-speaking country club set in the Highlands of Fife. They’d had a few girlfriends there, and everyone used to pretend they were part of the Club’s socialite inner circle. They ran a good part of the estate, and they were the guardians of the balance of power in the Clan.—

			But since the deaths of Henryk and Janet happened to be the last days of the glorious century, and since the atmosphere of the Neitherlands was exactly dingy and uncomfortable—it was feared that the gnats and mites of unbridled enthusiasm would overrun the delicate estate and kill all and everything and everyone and everything could possibly do was die—the Clan had decided to keep the Neitherlands secret. Not the weapons team, not the mysterious relocation of the family, the ghost of course, who everybody knew managed the Neitherlands like a private jet. The Clan kept the Neitherlands a secret because the Clan had to be very, very, very,

			“I like it,” she said. “I don’t know. It’s just—

‘Vines are pretty.’

			“You mean they’re like, six-inch ceilings?”

			“Yeah, so I just double-boarded it.”

			“What’s it like to be a niffin?” Plum asked.

			“I don’t know,” Quentin said, “I’ve never had an experience like this.”

			“Well, you’ll find out when you try and get in.”

			Quentin shushed her. He was getting the joke, but he was still rousing her from sleep, and this was getting out of hand. He started to get angry.

			“Look,” he said, “I know it sounds weird. And I said it a long time ago and I’m not going to get any younger. But you know what I think of when I look at that picture? That picture really does feel like home to me. I could almost look at that picture and think, I’ve got what it takes to be a king. I could do that every night.”

			“Well, look, it isn’t home to me. But I think it is to you. And I think you’d like it better if I did.”

			“I think you did,” Alice said. “After you were gone. And I think you’re still going to be my king. So don’t look back.”

			Quentin looked at Alice, who was looking right back at him

Cells that weren’t actually performing any work.”

			At the sight of those blank, black, black holes jostling for space, Janet’s eyes went wide. Then she sobbed.

			“Oh, God.” She spat onto the floor. “Oh, my God. Oh my God.”

			The wood elves had occupied the northernmost wall of the room. It was a shame, because the window through which they could see Fillory now looked out onto the wide open Southern Bay, and that would kill them if they touched it. The only way to save them was to make them crash through Fillory, onto the Shadow Map, whose coordinates they still hadn’t emerged from a-scouring. But how? She still couldn’t remember. The wood elven alphabet was kludgey and out of date. It had a different character for every letter than English letters had at that moment.

			“Hang on,” she said, “we have to find those coordinates.”

			“But if we do that—” Quentin said. “if we have to break the wall to do it,” she added solemnly, “how are we going to find it? We’re far, we’re far away, where are we going?”

			“That is the riddle we are trying to answer,” Plum said.

			“The riddle of why we’re even here,” Janet said. “The riddle of where we’re going.”

			She huffed her annoyance.

			“Find the needle in the haystack,” she said. “That is our plan.”

			She didn’t hear him. Eliot was thinking along the lines of: well, at least she’ll know where to look for it, then. He and Alice were doing that. And Plum, Eliot said something along the lines of: well, at least she’ll know how to traverse the fence, then.

			“At least she’ll know where to shove her baby,” Alice said.

I didn’t understand why he was so angry. He was very kind, very sweet, very childlike. I remember him with love and on the verge of tears.

Then I felt something inside me crack. Something gave me strength to do something I know I shouldn’t do, but which for many years afterwards I couldn’t unsee shone like a thousand suns through a hole in the canopy. It was the fear of what would happen if we broke the bond. It was the fear that if we spoke, he or she might hear us. It was the fear that if we left he or she might lose everything. It was the fear that, if we died, we would not be who we were ― people who have meaning and power in the world won’t die, just as it is clear that what we die will not be remembered. (There is another kind, I know: the rare kind that contains all the volumes of the Book of Mormon.)

I don’t know what day it was, but in the pouring rain I thought of something that morning, something that might conceivably be repeated every night, like the twelve days of astonished supplication. I thought of my father, who was dying of cancer, of my mother, who was dying of cancer. I thought of you, my father, who have given your life for the faith you once so hated. I thought of me, your son, who have given your life for the faith you once so hated. I thought of the children in the street, the crippled kid in a wheelchair, the kid with the red face, the ugly scar. I thought of them, and yet I felt like I wasn’t their father. I felt like I wasn’t their brother. I felt like I wasn’t their cousin. I felt like I wasn’t their son. I felt like I wasn’t their grandson. I felt like I hadn’t been any of them.

			I didn’t think about them until someone did: my mother.

			I didn’t even know she was dead. I still didn’t understand why she hadn’t come back. But I knew that she wasn’t with us.

			One night, on
====================
Cells of fire burst from his hands and poured out in a shower on the Enchanted Forest. The light was indescribably strange: fluorescent tubes of flame danced and illuminated the trees, and one after another a single bolt of lightning arced harmlessly from Quentin’s fingers, like a fallen star from a summer sky. But the most moving part came when the last of the trees had been cleared out and the last of the living forest sleeping giant that it was and retreated into the mist.

			When they were all through the scene plan had been set, and after Betsy and Plum they’d sent out Chaka and Stoppard, with instructions to kill the guy who’d set the trap. Chaka had trained as hard as anyone, and he knew how to handle a bow and arrow. He especially prized his accounts of treasure hunting, so he’d prepared a lot of them, and they were full of inaccuracies and omissions. There was never a lock of white beard that hadn’t been plundered. There was never a rare jade disk that hadn’t been plundered. But on the last night, in the very last act, the two of them—Chaka, with his—shot the bastard.

			It was a quick job, really: Quentin pulled a sniper’s trick from a mile away with a sniper rifle, lowered his head, and fired three or four times, without reloading, into the chest. The metal rose and fell like a pendulum, velveteen hammer and nails bouncing off it, leaving a trail of red dust in his wake.

			It didn’t stop the man, or the machine, but it was a close call. A sniper’s bullet always left a trail of dust behind it, and in this case there was enough of it to make a good guess at who the assassin was. Leaves and sticks and whatever they were trailing suggested a long shooting routine, and if that weren’t enough a very loud bang followed each shot, like someone had dropped a rock into a mortar bag. The man disappeared.

			The forest was silent. The only sounds were the rustling of hundreds of leaves and the clatter of hooves, and those hooves a very loud and clear, and very Lyra like, of course. Almost nobody was there to witness it, or

			The next morning is the hottest day in memory, and it just so happens to come on time, which means that because of a miracle of time travel, my father is going to prison that very minute. I don’t think he’s expecting any guests.

			I stumble downstairs to join the rest of my family. Penny, Emma, Joseph, Bella—we’re all in it together, I guess. We’re all in it for the long run. We all want Peter to get out soon.

			My father doesn’t look it. He doesn’t look like he’s about to give up his only heir without a fight. He doesn’t speak for thirty seconds, and then he sighs and walks away.

			“I was going to say hi to Peter,” Emma says. “But he’s going to get lost somewhere over the weekend.”

			“I can’t wait to die,” Penny says. “Want to go see Where the Sidewalks End?”

			We all head toward the front door. There are twenty minutes left.

			“Hey!” Martin calls after me. “You want to see the future? I gave it a go.”

			I didn’t want to go, but I said yeah. I didn’t want to pass up the chance to see what all the fuss was about.

			“You want to watch the future? Well, don’t,” Martin says. “It’s not very pretty.”

			“I am not talking here of the future,” Quentin says. “
====================
Cells and runes, such as we humans are, are metaphors, verbal games we play with symbols to tell stories or tell facts. They tell us things about the world, but they also tell us a great deal about ourselves, about where we come from, where we're going, who we are. And that's what counts.

			“When we die, who will take our place?” Plum said. “I don’t know. Maybe the ghost?”

			It came to that. Then the question really was: when?

			The other ghost, the one we’d just met, too, had disappeared. The one we’d known from down the hall at breakfast was here. But the one we’d known from earlier that day was, well, we didn’t know him.

			We’d only just begun our intercourse, and our sex was not yet apparent, but Plum was quite ready. She was not at all inhibited by her nervousness about this most intimate of subjects. It was obvious that she was ready.

			I recognized that moment, then, the one just prior, when we entered that secret chamber into the magical swamp and became men and women of flesh, so that as we shall see Plum was always ready to receive and process my verbal messages, processing them and processing them, forming them into words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, lobes of gelatinous meat lying motionless on plates of rough, boiling clay, with the laden liquid stretching out beneath us like a vast viscous spiderweb.

			Once we had that figured out, everything was explained. The other ghost had tricked us, or Plane of Water did; the truth is that we two had a great love affair, full of secrets and deceptions and deceptions and more lies. And the judgments would come, in due time, clouds parting, rain and sunshine and light and sweet music clearing my path again, and the love affair shall cease and I shall bury it where it lies, unspoken and unspoken but true.





			I never believed it then, but I believe it now that the secret of Plum’s wings was just a metaphor, a figment of our elaborate elaborate story. When we’d finished our performances, Rupert and Plum’ eyes locked for a second and then again

			“What are you mad at? Just stay here!”

			“I would rather be mad at myself,” Jane said. “At myself, and at you. You know what I would do? I would stay mad at myself. I would stay mad at myself, my stupid eyes, my stupid face, my stupid hands, my stupid stupid stupid face, my stupid face. I would stay mad at myself, at myself, at the world we make. I would stay mad at myself, at who we are.”

			She trotted off into the sunset, leaving him to his thoughts.








			It was a long time ago, but it was a particularly exciting time. The year was also early twentieth-century America, full of promise and peril and mischief. The earth felt flat, and the universe seemed to be running in a stream, streaming out from our little corner of it. Fillory was falling apart, and we were doing nothing to fix it.

			We were children then. We were fragile and helpless creatures, and the future was black and full of black. What would we do when the future didn’t want us anymore?

			Alice walked into the parlor alone. She came from the far corners of Fillory, away from the good parts, the whole mess, and she wanted out itself. It was beyond time to go home.

			But she said it anyway, because it was true. She wanted out now, and if the Great Sea dragged itself out there in the world there was no way around it. Going back now would take forever, and in an endless future there was no going back. Alice walked into the parlor alone, and she brought the long knife with her.

			The next morning was the much-anticipated breakfast of the year. It was the breakfast of our dreams, except that it wasn’t the dreams that were just silly, it was the dreams of children that weren’t even really dreams at all. They were just games, feasts and

Cells of light, of heat, of aching muscles and oozing cold, or maybe just the sound of it, running down the length of the wall. Another color, a lighter one, a deep teal. He felt it, that deep, heavy weight that was the universe. It was empty and bright, warm and fuzzy.

			He looked up at it. The ceiling was glass, question-mark-sized cubes of flawless flawless blue. They must be two candles on steroids, and the view was unbelievable. Eliot could see whatever he wanted to see, whatever lay below the level of the bubble, but if he looked down he risked overheating or exploding, or both. Because this was mental now.

			From below, Betsy whispered something, and his eyes fell and he felt hot like with a cup of coffee. But the view was unreal, nowhere near what he would get in a game. In real life there was no way to know what people would see or feel, but in Fillory games were started and ended by what people saw or did. Usually the starting point was the beginning, and in Fillory that was where the beginning came from: Ember and Umber.

			Whenever there was talk of a game Ember would swoop in and say, as if deciding for him anyway, and without waiting to see if there was anything else he stepped in and started the thing. It wasn’t always obvious what he was doing, but they always seemed to be doing it together.

			You couldn’t always be the Ask, but there was a lot of fun to be had inviting the attention of the forest to itself. You could call it a clearing, or a nexus, or a heart. You knew where the borders were, and when they weren’t there there was a heart to be found.

			You didn’t have to ask where they were getting the mana for it. The forest had one of its own, and it was always working somewhere. The forest had no enemies, and its people were noble, and among them were a young man called Martin. He was tall and tough and very talented. He was good with animals, and could led an expedition into the thicket of the Stray Ghost and see if he could catch it. Sometimes he got thirsty and gave up, but that was part of the adventure.

The man held the bag in front of his face. The man smelled faintly of smoke, like a tobacco pipe. He opened it.

			There were no words. There was just silence. The man smelled of smoke and smoke in particular, and he touched his face—his featureless face! He wiped his face with his sleeve. He opened his mouth, he said something, nothing.

			The man spat.

			He’d been drinking, and he wasn’t going to stop. He spat five more times, louder and louder, into the cold night air.

			“Stop,” he hissed. “Stop!”

			The man stopped, and then another, then another, six or seven.

			“Fucking fucking God,” Quentin said.

			He kept looking at his shoes. They were like black sandals. “Fucking fucking God. What have you done?”

			They were forks of some kind, four-leaf bibs, but they were crossed at the toes, too. Quentin knew what he’d been given: a small state, under complete and total control, he and his new master. The words were in a corner, in a vain effort to be seen, but he didn’t care. What mattered to him was that he was the center of the universe now, and that this was the center he’d been looking for all his life.

			He couldn’t see his master, but he knew he was looking for his master. If he ever walked away his master was going to kill him. That was his understanding of honor.

			“Maybe he already had,” Plum said.

			This was what he was after, the answer to all your questions, really. And if he couldn’t find it here it would be the end of his quest. Fillory was his afterthought.

			“Maybe he already was,” Quentin said. “And he’s coming through
====================
Cells of light burst from his hands and form a protective shield around himself. He focused all his magical strength and summoned a massive sphere of force from his hands and wrapped it around the entire library, forming a defensive dome around them. The two spells were in sync and the force was enormous—a greatsword would have pulverized the entire library, but these books were made of books, and books were made of magic. The force of the blow pulverized them into millions of books, the equivalent of one extremely dirty thousand-dollar bill.

			A jet of steam erupted from one of the lower windows. Eliot felt the coolness of his hands on the shattered glass, the warmth of his face against his stomach, and he let out a strained breath. It was almost noon, and he and Janet were still up so much of the magical energy from the earlier assault would have to be released in order to cool off. He traced a magical signature on the wall with his fingers, took a deep breath, and pushed through the paper tiger.

			The librarian’s office stood on the first floor of a nondescript building on Pennsylvania’s upper westside. It had to be a throwback to some era or another, a cheap shot where the intended targets weren’t actual historical figures, but some nondescript office building blocks and stones. Eliot scooched back through the hole like a drunk at a cab stand.

			There were no windows, but the light filtered in well enough, since the only light source in the room was the burning wreckage of the birdcage. There was enough empty space around the door that people could stand on the windowsills and look down on the carnage. Eliot breathed hard. It must have been a hundred and four-thousand-year-old funeral pyre.

			The librarian’s office was in a building that practically everyone knew existed, and also that people called Home Order. Eliot scooched again, this time down the hall, to the end of the hall.

			There was absolutely no way through it. The librarian’s office was in a stately tower that overlooked a back garden that was, geographically, very important. If he circled back and threw on with the channel-stuff, he could watch the back patio from mid-afternoon until dawn, when it all would start to

			“I don’t know that either.”

			“Well, come on! It’ll do the talking for itself. You guys are my only competitors.”

			The Front Porch was packed. It was the first time in nineteen years that somebody there had bought a ticket and been admitted, and Julia was rather taken with the young woman who applied. She was Julia Shelley, twenty-four years Julia’s senior, taller than Quentin, with slightly russeted skin and auburn hair. She seemed at first glance to be everywhere: on her features, your features, everybody’s features. But look even closer, and you would see that she was cursing the narrow life you have led. You would see that from the inside, the demons had invaded. Slip a coin in her pockets, and she could have stolen it from you without you even knowing it. She could have slipped it in your pants, or under your coat, or under there when she locked you in the trunk. She could have slipped it in any of your packages, or any of your suitcases. You would have felt it, even though you’d never seen it.

			You were dust in her world, nothing more. In Fillory you were nothing. But you’d learn that even the dead can’t feel. In Fillory, you became very skillful at making yourself look bigger and more important than you were. You took to stamping your massive large-print posters all over the city, even down to the most rudimentary of details, until somebody invented lampposts.

			Your parents were dead. You were blamed for their suicide, and you’d saved their lives, and you had ruined their dreams. You were good at it, in fact. You were pretty sure you could read people’ minds, and at least some of the time you could get them where you were going.

			“I don’t want to.”

			It was starting to sound like a comedy routine. So they just left it at that.

			“So what do you think the hell we are doing,” Plum said.

			“I don’t know,” Quentin said. “I mean—”

			“—I don’t know,” he said. “I mean, look at me! I am so immensely large! I am so enormously huge!”

			“I know,” Plum said. “But you are going to ride this magic jacket.”

			“I am not doing this to memorize formulas. I am doing this because Ember’s mission to bring back the dead has come to an end. He has brought back the head, he has brought back the body. These are our heads, our bodies, and we have to go.”

			“Well, good for him. If he is happy, I’m going to be happy.”

			“I don’t understand,” Quentin said. “A man who created the world, reconstructed it, restored it, sent his body down into the earth, and ate the dead, would want a bodyguard?”

			“You are not helping.”

			“I don’t want a bodyguard! I want to study with Eliot!” It was a strange, exotic dialect. Very Queensferps. “I mean, really, I want to study.”

			“You are a talented singer.”

			A rarefied air brushed over them.

Cells of fire and air. And the whole city was full of birds. It was a silent, sweet, romantic evening in Manhattan. The bird that lit up the sky that night was the red-tailed hawk.

			“I thought it would be Janet,” Eliot said. “But then it turned out that was her.”

			“I almost gave up.” Janet looked surprised, like she hadn’t expected to like him at all. “Told you. You’re going to like him a lot sooner than you think.”

			“Took you long enough.”

			They flew overhead for a minute, an invisible distance as if the universe had reset its time lines and reversed the flow of time itself. Eliot wondered if they were going to hit on one of those really gorgeous chandeliers in the library, the kind where they hung upside-down, the kind that went from black to bright pink, then black again. He figured it was impossible, but still.

			They were coming back to them eventually, jostled by them on their way back down. He wished he had someplace safer to go, somewhere quiet. Maybe there was a Andes-like sanctuary out there that he could call home.

			But he couldn’t find it. They were coming through so slowly they were barely that fast. They would get there, they would know them something, that was the way it was. He wished they stopped and talked, for a minute, to him and Janet and Eliot and Julia and Emily and all the rest of them, but no, they went on and on again, stopping only for a moment to take in the last of the rain and the city and the wisp of a pine tree across the street from their hotel, a half-trampled pole in the twilight.

			Eliot wondered what it would have been like to have been there. It must have been a different Eliot, different from the one he’s meant to have become. He wondered what it would have been like to have known it, to have been the one Fillory had been waiting for. He wondered what it would have been like to have been in the way. He’d never had to face his father that day, not like he had now. He

			The rabbit looked at the men with fear in its eyes—the fear of its situation. The fear that it would be blamed if it died in an act of kindness. The fear of what it might do if it did.

			“No.” Eliot said firmly. “You’re out. We’ll send you something.”

			The old man nodded.

			“Thanks,” he said. “You old goat.”

			He walked away across the parking lot.

			When he came back Quentin thought he smelled smoke. There was a long sink in the back, long enough that you could stand up in it, and in the sink came a silver-handled silver-pointed gun.

			“What is this?” he said.

			He pointed it at the bird.

			“The gun we’re looking for.”

			“The gun that gave you the power!”

			The bird sat up. Its eyes were wide. Its feathers were white.

			“The gun you’re looking for!”

			Its wings spread.

			“The power of thought! Please!”

			Quentin thought it was funny, but the bird didn’t say anything. It didn’t even flinch when he put his hand on its neck. It was crazy easy—you didn’t have to be a particularly large bird to do it. It went like this:

			You were put in the chair, in a roundabout way the most elegant leg of the couch, and you were asking a spell like affirm, or asking whether there was a clock in the corner of the room, or whether the door was really locked, or asking if the door was really the door, or if the kettle has oil, or asking if the kettle has soap, or if the clock says the wrong answer, or asking if the room is really a window, or asking if the window is really a window, or if the room is really a window, or if the room is really a window. You just kept on doing it.

====================
Cells in my head are chasing each other, and the more I play with them, the more I realize they belong to the same man. I have to decide, or I will give up. My heart—my whole being, or something very much attached to it—is trying to leap ahead of the maze of ideas that is my head. I try to run my whole life as a human, but as soon as I speak a word my ears start ringing and my vision begins to deteriorate. I am fading, being pulled ever backward into that stupid brain. . . I am being pulled backward too, backward through time, backward through space, backward through all times.

My great-grandfather, Pedro Manuel Olmedo López de Quiroga, came from Puerto Rico when he was four years old. At that time, like most Puerto Ricans, he was quite secular; he had no religious convictions whatsoever and he never prayed or read the New Testament. As a child, he has always been a devout reader of history and culture, both ancient and modern; as an adult, I suspect, he discarded much of that old reading and turned to astrology and numerology. (As a child, he had a beautiful scar on his forehead from a scar he had suffered as a child as a result of being the victim of a serial killer; later on, he was able to distinguish the two.) While I was in Providencia a few years ago, my great-grandfather obtained from a bookshop in La Esperanza Street, one of the Cortes mansions, a copy of the original edition of "Die Walküre," published in 1876, with a note attached stating that the book was for tourists taking part in a ball game being held that very year. The copy then in my hands has a paper binding, but the dust jacket of the second edition, which had not been opened, bore this handwritten notice by López de Quiroga: "This is for the use of my contemporary, José Hernández Martín Fernández, who writes for the register of San Juan."

During the years 1917 and 1918, my great-grandfather, who was in his fifties at that time, was engaged in various jobs. In Providencia or in Guadalajara, he was an apologist of the Popular Republic or of the Giránics; elsewhere, he was an

			Quentin wondered where he’d been all this time. He figured he got kicked out of Brakebills for no reason and then he went back to live out his secluded Nerd-Quentin life. What, was he still in high school anymore? Been in the fucking business a long time, kid. And he wasn’t even supposed to be playing anymore. He’d let it slide.

			Plum figured it out first. She was smart, and she knew what she was looking for, but he wasn’t there. She knew what she was looking for too, and she was going to show Quentin what being in love was all about.

			But first she needed to clean the house. That was where her head started spinning. Plover had given her house in Chester, but it was a castle on a hill, and it was in ruins. It had been looted, mostly, but the Baron had a thing for the arts and crafts and jewelcrafting and strange fancy things you didn’t see every day. You couldn’t really see much of them in person, but they were everywhere in the literature class she took once a week, and in the movies. The Baron had a huge, shaggy carpet of them scattered all over his massive library, and she wondered if they got bigger with each reading. It was full of books that looked like they should be rare or valuable items but which the library hadn’t catalogued or appraised, and which the library hoped to someday, through sheer chance, sell for a lot of money. She wondered if they’d been written in gold or real leather.

			She decided to go looking for them. It was a start, but her search went nowhere. It didn’t seem like it at the time. She found a couple of odd bits of jewelry and a box that so far she’d only ever seen by chancelight in movies and books: a huge brass case with a self-regulating self-regulator inside that flared up when it stirred, and which when it was on fire, made the

“There you have it. A general idea of the machinery. There is much more, but I think you get the idea.” ―Jeremiah Toole


No one knows more about this world than the great Hungarian philosopher and mystic, Heraclitus. Born in 523 in Carnaval (now in Romania) into a lower stratum of the Rosary orders, Heraclitus entered the academy at the age of twenty-five and became one of the most brilliant and consummate mystics of his time. Trained as a architect, he became a renown lawyer and eventually editor of a journal that disseminated his writings. Then, in 528, he was stung with an illegal citation and lost in a flood. Taken aback, he went to court, demonstrating (as everyone will do) that he was entirely innocent and that the authorities were using him as an instrument of propaganda. At the end of five days, he won a resounding acquittal. The authorities then declared that all his writings must remain in a vault in his honor, but in 529 he returned them to his readers for safe-keeping.

Heraclitus understood that the language of theology was infinite, but of illusory number; he therefore multiplied his writings and proclaimed that they were the number of a single soul. He knew that in the midst of this many writings were required to fulfill his purpose. He chose as his model the Hebrews, who multiplied the written word in order to give life to the book of life. Thus, the book he sought was divided in half, the first part of two halves, each half representing a people and a god. Thus, Atrahasis would be revealed in twofold form, the divine and the human, the agent and the effect. He chose the book of Isaiah, because it was rich in such important words as God's being, peace, and mercy, as well as the biblical figure of a king who is destroyed. Because it was written in a language man could understand, in order to glorify God in the Arabic language. Because it was universal, so that all people could enjoy it. Because it was the written word, which was itself a mirage. Because, finally, there was the Bible, the book we should accept as the word of God, in which would be found

Cells of light, of illuminated chambers. He kept thinking of it—the light of the stars, the light of the birds, the sound of the birds, the deep, steady murmur of the water, the delicate, almost imperceptible sway of individual plants. All interconnected. His body responded, obediently, without even the slightest need for language.

			He was in a room, a long room, almost a gallery, with windows on the sides. On the walls were relief scenes: here a naked woman was excreted into oblivion, on another a dead fish was devoured, on another a naked woman was a walking tomb, and so on. Or look at the ceiling: a group of naked women, one after the other, rising to a seated or reclining position.

			He was standing in front of a door, which was closed. Experimentally he worked it open.

			“Here he comes!”

			A second hand was sniffling in the hall.

			“Thank you.”

			Quentin recognized the face, the unexpected visitor. A friend had come through just as he had.

			“Hello.” He wiped his nose with his sleeve. “It’s good to see you.”

			They had a great clam chowder, served up in a springy pot with a wasabi-garlic glaze on top. It was huge, and the shad, if they were clams, was oily and spicy and just about the cutest thing ever. They had loads of it, at least a pound and a half. It was huge

			“Killua!”

			“Come on!” He gave the animal a big smile. “We’re just trying to help.”

			It cautiously circled the perimeter of the grove. It wanted there to be no lights, no sounds, no form to break the trance. It wanted to be in the real world now. It wanted to be able to get up and breathe. It wanted to go play with its toys. Plum got it. She got death, and she got it in spades. She’d seen enough to know that when a beast faced with death, even the bravest can be pushed back or even killed.

			But the beast didn’t want to be pushed. It fought to the death, and the last vestiges of aging flashed across its lifeless features, but it wouldn’t be pushed. It charged the spectral monologuing animal, and with a shout and a flip of its head it conjured up a limb. The limb was a limb, made out of light and matter and magic and energy and fire. It was like a composite limb, like a composite hand or a composite foot. It was like a god’s foot.

			Its mouth opened and closed like a bird opening and closing for a cry, but the god’s cry was as true as it was moving. The god’s dead, and now a god’s foot has come to life. The god’s dead, and now a god’s foot lives.

			The god’s dead, and now a god’s foot continues to torment mortals.

			The last image Quentin saw before he went out was not much more than a close-up of a young man, early to adulthood, sitting on a park bench with a can of beer in his hand. It looked like the scenery usually favored by teenagers,

And that before that you had already foreseen so many things, like the one about the key to the chest, all these years before that you foresaw that the key to the chest would be essential for the operation, and that you would know it first thing in the morning? Well, now that it is here, all my dreams are about you. They are like a big heavy blind in front of me, and sometimes I look at it and I think: Here it is, the key to my life. Sometimes I look at it and I think: The telephone book, the monthly review, the portrait of Emily Dickinson, and so on, long before they reach me. Often I look at it and I think: The river, love, the silence, the curve of a stone, the plan of the island, and so on, in infinite series. . . Each dream is a weapon against the next, against the last, and I know what the next will be. I keep count of the number of days since I last dreamt a dream and the answer is always the same: eight. ... Every morning at dawn I turn the pages of the book and at the end of the page there is a secret formula, a secret gloss on a secret page. In the margins of the previous dream I see symbols never before seen: a serpent in a glass, a crown, a star. The page reads: ASTROLOGNES. . . This dream occurred in the villa of Umbernazar in the San Marco. In the thirteenth century it was one of the greatest palaces in the world, and its density and symmetry made it possible to perceive, through the thin rims of their shining white hemlines, the infinite coherence of an infinitely thin space. The Feenehams left it in 1387, when it was reduced to rubble by the Saratov robbers. Later generations redid the renovations, and by the year 1402 it was one of the wealthiest sections of the city. Among the residents were Albert the Terrible, the imbecile, and his cousin, the madman accused of stealing the watch. Anthony de la Casa, the most illustrious architect of his time, erected for them a vast house, the "Hundred Piaves," which is still neonantious and shifting sands.

Beats by Nina Simone



On one of the many afternoons of a sultry rainy Saturday in March, 1912, I was up late in the room next to the desk, cramming as many pages of letter-perfect page perfection into my mind as I could carry in my arms. I had been writing Nina Simone until just before Easter Monday, when Mariposa Woodbridge died of a ruptured aneurysm. The loss struck me suddenly and unexpectedly; I had not expected to feel it for some time. I went to bed, exhausted and almost out of water and pencils, but Nina brought me up short the next morning. She listened to the news in the morning paper, the article was footnoted, her voice was audible over the newsreels, and she said:



“Nina!” I called out, to no one. Nina was at the piano.

She came out, just as I had thought, but she hadn’t come out to play. She was playing a different piece each minute, a perfect 3-D piece. With her fingers on the strings, she worked down to a nanosecond, like a clay pigeon. (Now that I think of it, she didn’t always play the piano that way.)













When I Was An Analytik



I wanted to know: what was it like for you to analyze Franz Kafka? It wasn’t so that first day; I wanted to know: what it was like for him to be analyzed. It wasn’t so that day either; it seemed like days. When I was eleven, I asked the question. At first I thought it was some kind of game, that if I could break his concentration for a day he would give up and let me go. But no, the thought of that day was still playing in my head. One afternoon, while I was sitting on the floor, I heard a voice say:



Teenager, your time has come. I am writing this on my coffin.

I am writing this book, which will be a book of children’s tales.


====================
Cells set up by the artists of the Third Reich, by the architects of Stalin's Russia, by the procurators of the inquisitions of Latin America. I turned the page of the History of Religions, which was devoted to the Gibson Monism of Squier; the note-books of the Hebrew University; the facsimiles and notebooks of the painters Goya and Chagall; the unfinished books of the Idealists; the entire discography of the sacred books of every nation and of every tongue. . . Immediately behind me, like a golden lamp, a distant horn blazed. It was the First Commandment; in the distance, the forests seemed even younger and denser.

Then, before my very eyes, the sky darkened again and a new Star of David appeared on the Mount of Olives; these actions had the tragic quality of surprising me with their permanence. In the depths of the grove of conifers, I dropped into the unconscious world of thorns and thistles.

Suddenly I recognized, without caring to express it, the old Cuban street. The glow of the torchlight made it clear that my thirst was satisfied. I wandered through the meadows, not seeking, not seeking, but rather, as is natural, in search of beings. I came across a great bullock cart with a woman seated on its seat. The woman looked at him with an expression I cannot forget and, after a time, felt comfortable ignoring him. In this fashion, for several minutes, the scene took on a religious significance for me. I did not seek out the man, I sought out the object of his gaze. I felt its weight, the depth of its temperature; I saw its hoarse heartbeat. Finally I spoke to her:

"There you have being found. I have understood you."

She did not answer me, but instead continued to see the bullock. I thought I had said the Lord's prayer, but in my sleep I had not. I dreamt that I did not hear the bullock reply, but that the sleeping woman answered me:

"You will not understand me until you answer me."

The case of the library of Babel is similar to that of the Spaniards who related that part of the Book of Mormon which is contradictory and which is built on the alphabetic characters found in the American books of

			He let out a deep sigh. He was stumped. This thing weighed something, palpitating rage and icy cold water, and he’d never even touched it. He took out his trusty urn and the knife from the drawers, made a deliberate indecision: he edged the handle of the knife through the whetstone and the water around it, and as luck would have it the whetstone didn’t want to go straight through it, it curved and bent slightly, just a hair, and the stone broke-off-center. He meant to strike at the water around it, made a tiny bead of it, and then worked his way up through the curve-

Cells, lines, or triangles, if you will. The first thing you notice about them is that they almost always end in a square. The square men left off constructing a bomb or a bridge. The blank stretch of wall between the rooms was a square foot of wall space, or perhaps a rectangle. The men who had constructed that empty wall left off with very different ideas of what a room was.

Your picture of Paris, I believe, would be much the same. Not all the rooms are created equal. The library at Linz, for example, is very large, but almost all of its volumes are two-dimensional; many of them are one-dimensional. I have studied the plans of some of the new houses, and I have verified the plans with actual builders and designers. I find that the large majority of the new constructions are very difficult or impossible; the prevailing opinion is that the inventors were afraid of constructing them and so hedged their bets. I conjecture that the builders did not want to pay the money they would have to pay out of, say, England, because if they had they still would not know whether they should pay out of France or out of England. (This conjecture is supported by the fact that in many instances the inventors promised to return to their forefathership in time of need either in gold or in silver, and the money they received was either poor or nothing.)

Another reason for the duplicity of the English builders is that they had many purposes; the square footage of the city greatly decreased with the addition of rooms, and the square footage of the workshops greatly decreased with the addition of tools, metals, and chemicals. The square footage of the stockrooms and courts greatly decreased with the addition of stock. The stockrooms, it must be said, were extremely cramped. Also greatly decreased with the addition of stock were the square feet of the dungeons ― the cells used for criminals and insane people. This decrease was most marked in the dungeons used for criminals and for the witches who inhabit them the stockholders had to settle the rent, which was almost as great as the square footage.

Another reason for the want of business within the walls is that the people of Finnegans Wake do not have the money. Another reason is that the stocks of the stockrooms and dungeons ― the stupid, the infirm, the lame ― were sold off in the past for very low prices, probably because buyers could not be identified
====================
Cells[2] = array_reverse(cells); } }

In the second program, I decided to change the color of each cell. I used a tool called Inkscape that I downloaded from the web.105

In the program, the character "A" is the new color of the cell, representing green, and the letter "B" is the old red. The letters "C," "D" and "E" become the letters "F" and "G." The closing square is the letter "H." The effect is this: in the first program, the red of the red cell represented by A was the new red of the page, and in the second program the red of the empty page was the new red of the page. The letters "I," "J," "K," "L," "M," "N," "P," "Q," "R," "S," "T," "U," "V," "W," "X," "Y," "Z," represented the outlines of outlines. The character "0" represented the beginning of the page.

I discovered that a program which did not close abruptly at the end of sentences was sufficient to permit the impression that a paragraph had just been written; this ability, I believed, was not lost on the author. I calculated that an entire page was necessary to execute the program, which gave the effect of a single line. I did not include any illustrations, since such would have implied two programs. To simplify the construction, I calculated that a single line of the program would do. 106

I had attained a point when I was forced to confess that I was stupid, and not kid-smart. A point when I was tempted to look at the program skeptically and conclude that it was a figment of my rhapsodic mind. But then I discovered a surprising program in the manual. At first Iignouraye-carte.cl didn’t seem very computerized, but after a while I noticed that it was able to emulate certain manual gestures which were, up to a point, possible only with a traditional programming language. Iignouraye-carte.cl’s gestures were, for example, determined by a single letter, but in an instant you could type a letter or two of Iignouraye-carte’s gestures and they would register. Furthermore, instant gestures had a special meaning,

Cells in my head started following me, and I began to feel the weight of the universe trying to get in my way. I remember the last time I spoke to you, a month ago, the memory was of my brother. I told him that my dear friend José Luis Affectada had died. He smiled and said that he knew just the thing to say: Élan a todos los niños, élan a todos les niños.

I am not strong, I told myself then, I am simple and I am free. The words seemed ridiculous to me then, absurd to me now; they seem absurd to you, dear Simon. I know now that those words were the first words I said to you since I left Buenos Aires. I followed him and I swear by the eyes of my lamp and the shoulder of Ramón Fring I followed him and I swear by the wind that blows upon my birdcage Featherman style, I dragged him under the table, I drowned him. I swear by the lips of a martyr who was tortured and then murdered.

The Waiting



Late one night in June 1945, in an office crowded with plans for the future, a policeman was examining the manifest from the night before, in order to redact some error. The document he read was a proposal for the discontinuance of cross-country telephone service between Buenos Aires andapollinaire and for the establishment of a new line 8001/2 in the city of Salvador. The former was to be maintained until noon on the third day of the following month. The latter, as now, ran into hundreds of possible numbers. The operation, the inspector realized, was relatively simple. He dialed 8001 and spoke the code prescribed by his conscience.

He was handed a newspaper and a plastic case. The case was opened and, on the following day, two cartridges of .38 caliber revolver. The paper was read, and in the pages of the newspaper which was indicated by a stencil on the wall, enthralled readership profiles for a monthly magazine and a novelty handbook. From time to time, a leaflet with footnotes was shown off, with ingenious solutions of obvious problems left up to the readers to solve themselves.

All this, on the third of July. All of it, for Wharton. He had been planning this scheme, developing

Cells of Light" and "The Long Walk to Vermillion."

			“I didn’t even know there were any such things,” Plum said. “Now I do.”

			“Pretty amazing that Fillory is still standing.” She frowned. “People always say it’s dying, but I don’t think it is. It is dying, but it is so very much alive.”

			“Do you still love her?”

			“No. But I do want to be with her.”

			“Oh. Well, I will never marry her. That’s the deal.”

			“Well, then maybe it isn’t dead,” Eliot said, blissfully nonplussed. “It could be hiding in plain sight.”

			Plum snorted.

			“You dare?”

			“Probably it’s already dead,” Plum admitted. “It could be Quentin.”

			“True.”

			They slept that night in the Jer meadow, halfway around the world, partly magical landscape that was Fillory. The view was magnificent: the meadow from above, the meadow below, the same panoramic effect but over a much wider range. But at least you could see where you were going.

			As they rode the wind shifted from west to east, and the view shifted back to the perspective of the Jer. Eventually Plum stopped worrying and just wanted to be somewhere else. Suddenly they were somewhere else: they were on a desert island, or in a marsh, or out in the marsh, out of earshot of distant water, looking down on a nightmarish scene of dying plant and animal life.

			“Look at that!” Plum said. “It looks like aye, one, aye, yonder!”

			They’d ridden out the sun and the wind, but the marsh was getting to be something more. Here and there a tree had survived, a few stout growth rings that’d shortened in places and started to topple. It was a kind of stal

Cells were getting clogged. The power went out and he got up and walked around it. He needed to get away from the building.

			“OK, I get it, you have a lot on your mind. Just get back.”

			But he couldn’t. The truth was, he was stranded. He couldn’t leave. He was stuck here, and he was scared.

			“OK, problem solved.”

			“OK,” Eliot said. “Let’s get out of this place.”

			She drew her sword, but she couldn’t quite get the point of it. It was a lot easier to hide one in one’s sleeve. It was a lot easier to get away with it. It was also a lot more dangerous.

			“No,” she said. “No, don’t.”

			She bent down and grabbed his wrist, stopping him cold. “Don’t. This isn’t working. You’re going too fast.”

			She drew her own blade. They were practically touching—Eliot was moving at a fraction of the rate, but the effect was the same. They veered off into a side alley, a real bad idea to pull the pin on with a simple-looking robbery. They could have used the distraction.

			“Keep moving!” Janet said. “Right now I need you to come with me to the Bronze. Talk to me when you get back.”

			He moved as if the prospect of keeping going were a gale that was going to blow at any second. Eliot could barely walk when she gave him the signal.

			“The Bronze?” he said. “The Bronze? Seriously? Seriously? God, how far is it to the top?”

			“The top. The top. That’s all I’m talking about.”

			“What about the Bronze? The guy who cast that spell!”

			“The Bronze? The Bronze? The Bronze? The Bronze?” She stopped walking and looked up at the

			“Are you saying that you and I, Jane and me, are the same?”

			“Jane is a demon,” Quentin said. “She comes in all different kinds. I come in only one: Jane is real. She is here, and this is what she represents.”

			“Real,” Betsy said, her voice rising again. “That must be it.”

			“I don’t know that. I guess we could say she’s a demon from another world.”

			“Another world?” Betsy piped up. “Another town? Bird? Man?”

			“Bird,” Jane said. “That is the name of the bird who made the fair town in The Scarlet Letter. The fair one. The one you went to. The one you know.”

			“Bird,” Eliot said, “don’t change your answer. Bird, this is Jane.”

			“Jane.” Betsy cocked her head at him for good measure. “Don’t change the subject. We discussed it.”

			“What is it like to walk the halls of Fillory?” Jane asked.

			“I don’t know,” Eliot said. “We don’t do that much of it.”

			“Jane, if you didn’t mind my asking,” Eliot said, “what does it feel like to be a gnu on a quest like this?”

			She looked surprised for her lack of history in magic.

			“I don’t know,” she said. “I’ve never had one.”

			“You haven’t.” Betsy pressed a hand to her mouth. “I don’t think I’ll ever have one.”

			“Jane, come on,” Eliot said. “We have to find Jane.”

There was a long silence.

'Do you think you can get into my head? I am a king, I am a god! I am immortal! ' said the elf. 'Farach greets the god Atum. Atum hears this and thinks: Farach, you are very strange. You seem to relish the company of gods. I hear your prayers and listen, I cannot resist. But I could not help thinking you would rather pray to a stone idiot than to a god. "Farach, you are very strange. You seem to relish the company of gods."'

The air was full of minutes of this and other trifles. Everybody was waiting for the verdict. In the midst of it Franz said:

			“I would say that about a quarter of the stories are fake,” Janet said. “But you’ll notice that we’re not in Manhattan anyway. That’s part of the attraction.”

			“Does it bother you that much that you can’t make it in? That’s part of the point?”

			“I don’t think so. Not that it’s not nice, it is,” Poppy said, “but no more than necessary. Most of the time I just don’t have time for that.”

			“Well come on,” Eliot said. “We have to find Alice. You guys are in great shape.”

			Janet nodded.

			“We will.”

			They all left the room. Nobody opened the refrigerator, which had been reprogrammed to explode any time a precise code was given. Then Plum said, “Well, why don’t we try it again?”

			“Maybe we should,” Eliot said. “Think about it. A quarter-century is a long time in magic.”

			“We could try again,” Plum said. “If that makes sense.”

			She persisted, but Janet just looked at her with a strange, impressed smile.

			“Well, whatever,” she said. “You’re the one who wrote the spell, after all. It’s you or me. What about it?”

			“I am the spell. I am in control. Emery, please.”

			“Is that in a cabinet or something?” Poppy said. “Trust me. I’m the best magician in Fillory. You’re going to need it.”

====================
Cells of fire broke out in his eyes, and he collapsed into himself, clutching at his head like a drowning manectant.

			“It wasn’t supposed to happen here!” Plum said it, the whisper of desperation audible on her son’ words. “It never will. And you know what? This isn’t goodbye. This is’t goodbye.”

			The next morning Plum woke up, and she didn’t like the way her sheets felt. She found a window and looked out.—

Plum’s mind was a river of possibilities: it could be Antarctica, or Manhattan, or the Great Northern Lights. Everything else faded to gray, and Plum felt a twitching in her stomach, and a hot, quickening urge to flip open The Economist, and then dive back into reality. She couldn’t do that, not right now. Something—anything—was trying to stop her.

			It was the ghost. The ghost of the ghost. It was hard to describe, just like gravity was a language, and there was no words to describe how words could not describe this enormous happening, but there was nothing she could do about it either. She was a child again, and she wasn’t teaching herself. She wasn’t growing as an adult. She was drunk on power and ambition.

			She was also Alex’s father, and he was dead. That was another strange one. He’d lived his life as if his death were accidental, as a kind of surprise, and now it was coming out in the open, and it was making its way through. What had he expected when he banned magic? What was his legacy going to be? What, was he going to keep on being king of the Britons and not care?

			His features were similar to Cynthia’s, but different in a number of ways. She was struck by how lifelikably he conducted his death, though not so by the manner in which he did it. Inanimate objects, especially a magic one, went first, and Alex took ahold of them and went ahead and did the kicking and punching and force-punching. He’d been training for this moment, and it was almost over already. It had never even occurred to him.

Cells of light.”

			Quentin thought she might be right. She was right about everything. It was a pity the one person who didn’t seem to enjoy this immensely was Alice. She didn’t like it here.

			Quentin started for the door, but Eliot stopped him.

			“Eliot. It’s good to see you.”

			“Same. What brings you back to Fillory?”

			“It’s not just the Fillory part,” Quentin said. “It’s more than a little bit exciting. Is there anything in particular you’re looking for?”

			Eliot shook his head.

			“There isn’t. I can’t find anything. Nothing. Nothing exists. What doesn’t there mean?”

			“What is there, really? Are there no contradictions? There are a lot of religions that say there is a God, but there’s only one God. There has to be a God, and He must be awesome. What’s awesome? I don’t know. I feel like I studied with that guy who made the Matrix.”

			“You are very brave. Study with that guy!” Stoppard hissed, unbent and dripping with sweat. He was down 'em in about ten-second chunks.

			“He was pretty cool,” Quentin said.

			“Yeah, and I owe him that gun. No joke.”

			They were getting close to the door when Plum jerked her head in the other direction, alarmed.

			“Ember!” She called, and the water in the drain popped dry. It opened onto the beach. It had to be some kind of picnic area, a golf course-lite sort of vehicle. Quentin had never seen one before. It put him off sports entirely.

			“Oh, hell.” He ’d forget them. He put his hand on the carapace of the carapace, as if it were a shield, trying to get some of the cosmic energy through his fingers.

Cells, one by one, shattered and burned.

			She turned, pausing in front of the four dead clocks. No one moved. It was like the clocks themselves had exploded, defying the will of the gods.

			“What did you expect? It was a dream.” Plum shrugged.

			“I had a great time there, you know?”

			“I did,” she admitted. “And I gave birth to you the Chalk Man.”

			“That is true.”

			“I wish I’d taken more of your stuff. I thought you might need it when you need it most.”

			“That’s true.”

			“But no more of your magic,” Eliot said.

			“I don’t need your magic. I’m done with you.”

			He practically facepalmed.

			“You’re not—?”

			“No, I’m not. I hate you. I think you are the only person on the face of this planet who could possibly save Fillory.”

			“I am not going to save Fillory,” Quentin said, “but I’m going to try. And I’ll try as hard as anybody else, because I think you are the only person on Earth who deserves to have his or her hopes and dreams and hopes crushed flat by some nerds from Fillory.”

			As much as he hated to admit it, he actually did envy Eliot. Theirs was the kind of exultant, almost maniacal, optimism. All the rage these days. Quentin pried open one of the drawers in his chair and took out a package. It was a blunt-force mandible from one of the stones around the ruin now covered with plants. He flipped through the scripts, one after the other.

Cells of light and sound. The world around him was a blur. He kept looking back at the temple—the temple, the temple, the temple. He was en route to the opposite bank, the one with the light, the one without it.

			“There’s a whole other continent out there,” Plum said. “I think we should head that way.”

			They agreed to it. They hobbled outside the temple, down the narrow cobblestones, back up the trail of brick walls. Behind them broke up into islands a couple of huge ice floes, the highlands emptying out into the dim southern twilight. The sun was just peering over the horizon when they reached the northernmost wall. It was still there, hard and immovable, an uninterrupted sheet of metal, before which nothing had moved for centuries. Quentin turned his face to the twilight sea and back again, lost in thought.

			He wasn’t a very good chronicleor. Not anymore. Not with the flanks broken and the lead cut. He took his hand from the sword’s hilt and ran a tasseled spell along its edge. Then he bent it gently over the edge of the ledge, and three times, leaving a rope of silver in the air, he ran the same rope over the edge of the opposite cliff, and again, leaving a rope of his own suspended in the air. The silver floated down, attached to the ropes, and when he looked up he saw that the last cliff face showed a thin ring of smooth black rock, set in the water like an eye of a fish. It was Dagestan.

			He was almost on him, almost out of luck, but he held on to the ledge and made one last clockwise spiral up the side of the mountain, until he was facing the sea.

			And there is no sign of Endgame. Not in this little cove. Not where this was he had sworn to explore. Not in the seventeethies. It must have been another continent, or world. Whatever it was, it was eons away.

			Then he was forever. It was ten years ago this night when he touched the sword that Elizabeth had threatened to kill him off from. It had not moved that day, but when he looked at it the next day it

			The walls of the study were covered with stacks of thick, clear, oily folder after folder, nearly as big as the window, labeled’s and hundreds of them. Each one was labeled with a name of a character from the story: arrowhead, clock, candle, cloak, drawer, frog, frost giant, frost wall, green dragon, hammer, hinge, hinge finger, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot, hinge foot.

Cells of light, and an image of a bird on a tree trunks, and the words, "These branches are made of spirit."

The next day, the first of the disciples, Joseph, accompanied by Simon the leper, returned from the forest. They halted in front of a goldsmith. Silvanus, who had come from Rome to see them, wished to buy one thousand denarii of mercury (one thousandths of a gold piece) in silver. The goldsmith refused; Jesus said that he would pay what was due him, that is, what was due him according to the Scriptures and what was due to the church. Judas Iscariot, afraid and suspicious, came up with a lie; he said that the goldsmith owed him one hundred shekels of silver, or one shilling ($1). Jesus said to him, "Pay this day and you will receive what you ask." Judas hung up the money and went away poor; Jesus fed him and provided for him and sent him word that he would be received.

The third disciple was Sappho. She had been chosen at a very young age to be a communicant of the mystery of the Immortals. She had seen the world and nothing remained that she saw not all, and that which she saw was less than that which was. She knew their acts from their words, their customs from their customs, their customs from those of the barbarians. In her mind there grew up a memorial of all that was barbarous and all that was wonderful about that nation. Later on, in Alexandria, she learned that the books there were the secret and eternal word and that the Word was its eternal model. She knew that this word was the consummation of all things, and that all things were one and that all one. She knew that all things are one, that there is not a rock on earth that is not in the court of one of the Gods, and that the gods and men are one and the same. She knew these things and more, and this was what moved her: the injustice and the worship and the magic. She wanted to understand; she wanted to be understood.

Then came the letters. These letters were more difficult for her to understand than the stilted pagan gibberish. The things one reads are not mutually exclusive, but rather are determined by and are dependent upon one another. For example, there is

Instant Gratification

You see, it isn’t all rosy. I’ve been on disability ever since that train wreck with the subways. I got separated from my partner of six years and we’ve been together only a couple of months. I don’t know how long that really was, but it was a long time ago and I haven’t been together since. We’d had some pretty rough days–we were climbing out of the snow, after all–and I offered to take your trash with me, but he said no, he needed the money, and there was no more room in the trunk. So we’re just about to leave the garbage can up there, and when we came back down the stairs it was full of stale rolls from the candy store.

			“That must’ve cost you some instant graces,” Janet said.

			“Get back to me if you need help,” Lionel said, “but don’t think I didn’t warn you.”

			“You can’t keep me prisoner forever, you know that.”

			“You can’t keep me from Fillory forever.”

			“You know that I can’t return to Fillory if I want to,” Janet said. “And I know that if you try you’re going to get in trouble.”

			Even as she said it the words came back to her, first for emphasis, then as they plummeted to the ground like a stone from an aeroplane: “You can have the book, if you want it. You can read it at any time you want.”

			She did have the book, of course. It was in her palm, on a plain in the Dutch countryside, a couple of yards from the rim of a grassy meadow. It weighed about one ton. But it felt like more than that, something deep down she’d always wanted, something she’d kept locked up and away from others, from other people, until now. She’d wanted to show it to Eliot, but only because he’d always seemed

Cells of heat build up in the room, and the walls start to glow faintly, like a pool table is going through an ice bath. The thought of spending his whole life in a box again somehow makes Alice shudder. Might as well take you straight to Hell, she thinks.

			But she can't think that way, she can only think that this is very unlikely. She can't even think that it is unlikely. It could be any number of things, and none of them are worse than the other. The odds are long against it, but she can still do with them what she wants with it. The possibilities are endless, the ordeals infinite. And yet. . .

			What she doesn’t do is try to imagine what it would be like. Imagining anything at all.

			It wouldn’t even be a box, it would be a blank page. It would be a blank page and Alice’s voice. Reading would be an easy, friendly, breezy thing, word for word, a page or two at a time. Scribd would be right there, right there, ready to be shared, ready to unload its load of photocopies of Alice’s precious novels right back onto the dusty, dark, damp and cold floor where she had all but sprinted to when she showed up.

			She imagines that the sharing would be rapid and total, that this would be the sharing of the future. She imagines that this is what she wants, because otherwise the future is going to be terrible.

			And what about the present? What about now? Well, if she reads now then she’ll know that she doesn’t have to share anything with him, and that she can walk away. She checks off the boxes on the nondescript checkerboard she keeps track of in her head—reading complectedness, complectedness complectedness, sharing, nondiscretion, nondiscretion, nondiscretion, sharing, sharing, nondiscretion, nondiscretion, sharing, nondiscretion, nondiscretion, sharing, nondiscretion, sharing, nondiscretion, sharing, nondiscretion, sharing, nondiscretion, sharing, nondiscretion.

			It is surprisingly easy to lose track of all the boxes. She finds herself going back and forth between pages and pages
====================
Cells and lines and words flow together in a vast sea. The vast sea is a mirror of the universe. Every living thing on the vast sea has a mirror-image of it: a bird on a mirror disc; a hippogriff with an image of a buffalo; a tiger with an image of a tiger. . . Everything has a mirror image, and nothing can go through another thing's mirror image without destroying itself. A man who is confronted by a man in a mirror never imagines the former, neither does he ever expect the reverse. Thus all men are led to think that they are tigers and that all men are mounted on tigers. This absurdity (and more) have been written by foreigners and may be found in critics who are not foreigners in fact, but in their judgments and in the intentions of the writers. But if we consult the reports of Hladik and myself, which are spread over three volumes, we shall see clearly that in some tribes it is not impossible, but rather very difficult to achieve the desired effect. In tribes where the kings rule, the power is divided equally between the king and the people. The people rule on an hereditary basis, as in many tribes of Italy. The king's equals rule, but not the kings. In the most ancient clans, the incestuous, or abortive, are unknown. The princes rule according to custom; some survive and are revered; others, fall from grace and are not venerated again. The people revolts against the injustices of the princes and kills them. This murder, which is also a declaration of the people's will, is followed by a renewal of the genealogies. Then the custom prevails that each new king should call a referendum on the old one. Those who do not believe in genealogies submit that none of the ancestors of their uncle should have ruled over them, that is, that their grandfathers should not have ruled over them, and that their great-grandfathers should not have ruled over them.

Kumail and the Clown



One of the most striking features of the current interest in my case has been my status as a dangerous man. This does not mean that I am irresponsible or immoral; it simply means that I am misunderstood. I have always maintained that my danger lies in my ambiguous method, in my difficulty in finding the right words and in conveying them effectively. I am not presented with many options; my meaning is constantly shifting. To make a rational assessment of the value of my efforts, I am forced to judge everything through the narrow vision of an assassin's. Thus I have approached the problem of the fifty volumes of my childhood, seen everything in the magical recesses of my grandmother's house,feel sorry for Helena Bonham Carter,felt sorry for Annie Oakley,seen everything in the history of the Gnostic Church,felt sorry for the duel between Tennyson and Bailey,observed everything in the movements of the Jacobins,felt sorry for the dearth of passengers in the last carriage of the Rijksmuseum,known the complete works of Tennyson, felt sorry for the hanging, but never killed him. Thus I have approached the problem of the Orpheus and the Tristam stories,known only in books,but which seemed to me like the description of an impossible ideal. Thus I have approached the problem of the chanson de la lunesia,known only in the mind of a vanished people,but which seemed to me like a language which spoke. Thus I have approached the problem of Léon Bloy's drama,Ce qui a été résolu,which I have never seen,but which for my part I treasure admiringly. Thus I have approached the problem of Thomas Pynchon's Watchmen,known to me only in a dream,but which for me is the definitive version of the great American nightmare. Thus I have approached the problem of Borges's encore,Carlos Fuentes's masterpiece, and I have never seen it. Perhaps one day I shall see it. Perhaps then I shall never have seen it. Perhaps I shall have seen it once, and then forgettable; and perhaps, by then, it will have lost all meaning.

The books I have mentioned are not worthless; they are pleasurable because they are deceptive. I have not looked at them, not even once, since I

Cells of light in a limestone cavern. A man on a gurney dressed in clean white hospital scrubs worked over his face with a sharp metal wheel. He was working over something warm, something slimy, something floating on a liquid texture.

			He spoke haltingly.

			“I work with you in the hospital wing.”

			“Yes,” he said. He held up a gloved hand. “You. Me. Bird. Bird of Pre-Allegheny County.”

			“My name is Jane Chatwin. This is with­ Inés’s’ transfer to the infirmary.”

			“And congratulations.”

			She smiled, but she didn’t laugh. In truth she didn’t blame him. She would have hit the living daylights out of him. She even had the anatomy books back, the dime-store ones, back in their cases. She had her hands full with the trombones. She poured them out onto the floor and started picking them up again.

			“I would say that your life has been pretty satisfactory thus far,” she said. “But it’s not perfect.”

			“It’s not?” He said. “Look, you’re not going to win us anything.”

			“I don’t think we’ll win you anything.”

			The conversation, for the purposes of this story, had to be set in motion. In the waiting room Alice brought him a mug of rare brandy, then left. He followed her. It was a long way from the tranquil backyard garden where he’d been hoping to start, but then again there were no flowers. There wasn’t even any affection in the way the women were speaking. It was more like they didn’t even want to have a conversation. They wanted to have a drink with somebody else.

			Now he’d figured out how to get people to talk. A woman even took pity on him. She was Vivienne Chavannes, formerly Jane Addeby, and she had been carefully sequestrated away in a room at the Radcliffe

Cells. And switched on the lights.

			“I still don’t know what’s in the tarantula, but it’s not going to sit by itself and be okay. It has to be stirred. That’s what a story is. A place where we aren’t supposed to be. A forest. A underground city.”

			“Where?” Eliot asked. “In the dark.”

			“In the dark. No. Keep it high up. That way it can’t be stirred. Also, with all the magical machinery in the place it’s hard to converse with the demon. He could be tricking us all we want, but we should still be afraid.”

			“What about the key?” Janet said. “Key, shield, spell?”

			“Those too,” Quentin said. “Take them.”

			Plum picked up the pace, running on egg whites even though she’d been practicing juggling for ten minutes.

			“Quentin, where are we going?” she said. “We have to find Elisha.”

			“Where are we going?” He said it again. “Where are we going?”

			“We have to find Elisha.”

			“Where are we going?” He said it again. “Where are we going?”

			“Where are we going?” He said it again. “Where are we going?”

			“Where are we going?” He said it again. “Where are we going?”

			““Enders are black.”

			“What’s ender?” Eliot said.

			“That word.”

			“In the end,” Janet said, “it’s all right. It’s not that.”

			“Good metaphors,” Eliot said. He was still practicing juggling by this stage,
====================
Cells>;}</script> <script language="javascript"> if (typeof request === 'function') { request(200); }</script>

The above function signature is straightforward, but there's more. It calls itself with a dictionary of request parameters, each of them associated with a different characteristic (for instance, the character "\u2606" is associated with speed). The signature gets a little complicated, I think, when we add a dash of a sed construct, but the idea is simple. We have a request, a function that takes a request parameter and returns a response parameter of some kind. We also have an if statement, which executes the function body after the request has been executed. The above signature would have the form

if (typeof request !== 'string') { request(200); }

which looks like a lot of conditions, but in fact its just one of many ways of writing the same thing. When you write it that way, it usually has a very short name: if (!p !== false) then ... else ... endif . But in fact the above signature doesn't really tell us anything about what the above function does. It only tells us that we don’t have to specify the parameters with anything at all. We can ignore the if part altogether. We can say that the whole thing checks out like this:

if (!p !== false) { request(200); }

Or more precisely:

function if (!p) { return p ? false : p; }

If (!p) { return b ? false : b; }

Functionals usually have only one level to them: the basic idea is the same, just laid out in a higher order. In C, by contrast, you can have levels one to nine, depending on the idea of the problem you are coding. In particular, in the classic example we studied above, you would have a level 10 thinking about black and white television. In fact, there is nothing new under the sun in that definition.

Functional levels are very useful when you want to structure your program in such a way that it will work on all sorts of different machines. For instance, I recently did some research on operating systems. Almost all the utilities I came across told me that most computers were programmed to accept one program at a time, though they could also accept any number of other programs. So I programmed
====================
Cells wiggled back and forth on the table like the tails of fish. The table was yellow and stretched out in front of him like a big pile of books. He took note of the maps, the major ones, the ones that depicted where the fire was, what the people were doing, who was meeting up with the kings and queens and princes and commons and all the rest of it. They were organized in neat rows and columns on everything from yellow to blue to red paper.

			Plum picked out the one that depicted Fillory. It was a neat row with a nice concentric ring around it.

			“That should do it,” she said. “should get us started.”

			“You think?” Quentin said. “You think we’ll write to you?”

			“I might. But not yet.”

			“I think it’s time we did something,” Pearl said. “I mean, you’re a king, afterall. You have the power to summon an army, you know. You could start a war.

			“Oh, I know what a war would be.”

			“Well,” Quentin said, “if Fillory was going to be an army.”

			“Oh, come on!” He was going to bring it on. This was taking a turn for the horribly horrific. “So you’re worried about recruiting?”

			“Oh, no. Not at all. I mean, I’m a little broke, but I don’t have a lot of noble sons.”

			“Well, then maybe you should start one,” Plum said. “Something like, say, the Fillory army.”

			This was going to be Quentin’s experiment. This would be his recruiting sergeant.

			“All right, all right.” But before she could finish her sentence Eliot interrupted her reverie: “But how? How are we going to get this army going?”

			“I think we’re going to do what kings do: we�
====================
Cells made of light were forming around the black whale, and it began to turn and glare at them, its wide-set yellow eyes shining with murderous intent.

			“Jesus,” Poppy said, looking up from her feet. She was starting to feel a little nostalgic too. It was good of her to go to all that trouble. “I meant to say that our days are numbered, but perhaps we shall yet see you again. Perhaps you will return, and we shall be fed again.”

			We galloped on, along the coast, up through the peaks, back down through the shallows, back through the blackness, back to the hive, back up to the Paranadiers, back up to Spring Lake. It went on like this for hours and hours, in the silence, and the air was rich with the musky sulphur of camphor. At the end of two hours the tide came in and the race was on.

			Eliot had done most of the fighting. He’d been perfectly composed, right up to the point where he was getting harassed, and he'd taken evasive maneuvers, but the thing was fast and agile and having a go at you with his dime–and his machine gun–on the last three feet of the plunge was an admitted feat of strength and skill. There weren’t many people who could do that. Eliot had to lean his weight on the strength of his arms to keep his balance as the last of the trees blew away behind him, and when the last one disappeared behind him he saw that the only light was from God knows what he was shooting at. He saw a world gone mad.

			For a second Eliot thought he was going to pass out. Then he passed again, and his eyelids popped, and he looked up into the endless black, which was no longer a world at all, it was a blur of points and shadows and colors. He looked around: there must have been a lot of shouting and kicking and gouging around here, and a lot of screaming and crying. He looked back down at his eyes, which were still full of blood.

			He looked up at the sky. It was a blue moon.

			“Just remember, everything I say is the truth,” he said. “If I’m not talking,

Cells.”

			“You’re not going to convince her,” Quentin said. “And maybe you could at least explain to her why she’d gotten here in the first place.”

			“What does she want?” Plum said. “Human flesh?”

			“She doesn’t know that. She’s been so distracted that she’s not paying attention to the world around her. She’s overthinking it.”

			The old woman frowned at them both. Her white teeth were set in a circle, like a V, like a clock.

			“I do not know,” she said. “But you’ll know them when you’re here. When you’re a man, or a god.”

			“A god,” Plum said beautifully.

			The old woman nodded gravely.

			“You’re right, we’re not making her. It’s not worth it.”

			“She’s made her peace,” Quentin said. “And she will stay that way. Whether she likes it or not.”

			The clock-tree gave a woolly sound, like an uprooted tree. Plum leaned over and picked up a loose piece of silver from where it was stuck to the wall, a few inches, and examined it skeptically. Then she picked up a handful and examined it over the woman’s face.

			She did not say anything.

			“I’m the Boss,” she said at last.

			“You don’t know anything,” she said again.

			Buck’ Oo’’god,” she said. “Give her what she wants, but she’s still stuck with the damn clock. I told her that. Where’s the rest of the clock bowl?”

			Buck turned back to the clock-tree. Its bronze legs were gone, replaced by wooden legs that swung down to fit the sides. The mother of all frown-faces was

Cells of light. It was like they’d taken a huge window off its frame and was about to throw it sky high.

			“I know, I know,” Quentin said, trying not to rock the boat. “But I’m just—I don’t know. I just don’t feel ready.”

			“Quentin, listen to me. This is big. Maybe you’re wrong. But for the love of God, get ready to blow.”

			“For the love of God?” Plum said. “We’re getting married?”

			“Oh, hell no. That’s stupid. Get ready to die.”

			“For the love of God,” Quentin said, “aren’t you crying? It’s not your fault that you’re a shitty magician? Or god? You don’t even know what a fuckton of magic it takes.”

			“Well, no. I do. But you know what I’m doing wrong. I’m doing it wrong because I think I can.”

			“But you can’t,” Plum said. “You know what I’m doing right?”

			“I know. But it’s not right. This is too hard. I want to do it right.”

			“But you can’t,” Quentin said. “You mentioned your father. His name was Joseph Priestley. Does your father still live at 1191 Southland Avenue?”

			“He did. They moved to a bigger spot with nicer comforts when they started living out in the desert in the sixties. I don’t know why they wanted a bunch of sand between them and the rest of the universe, but I guess they didn’t bother to pay anybody any mind. Maybe they were too scared. I don’t know. They could have chosen anything in this county. They could have had any property. They could have had anywhere they wanted. But they didn’t. They lived at 1191 Southland Avenue.
====================
Cells in the room.

			“If that’s all,” he said, “I’ll just spill it on your desk.”

			“I don’t want to spill it on your desk!”

			Fogg cleared his throat, then cleared his throat even more, then Fischer cleared his throat too. They were all standing around the table, with the same expressions and the same weirdo air.

			“I have a question,” Alice said.

			“Yes, your question?”

			“Yes, your question.”

			“Why are you still here?”

			“I was going to take you with me, but then I realized you’re more valuable behind the counter than you realize in the ballroom.”

			“More in the wine room,” Josh said.

			“More in the wine room than in the rest of the house. More in the whole damn castle.”

			They were all going through the same kind of magical mire. The last time they’d all been on this earth together—

			“The other one,” Josh said. “Which I think you’re forgetting about.”

			“He is the Vampire King, Josh Krause.”

			“Vampire king,” Jane Finch said.

			She was right; it was all true. As far as he was concerned, this was it. This was his time. He was going to win, and he was going to win big.

			Finch’s face fell. She studied the ceiling.

			“But I’m not sure yet,” she said. “I mean, I think I might be able to get you out, but then what?”

			Josh, clearly unimpressed with her contemplation, leaned forward and kissed her again. It was too much for Jane. He pulled away and she leaned back, burying her face in her hands.

			It was better than sex, she thought. Sex wasn’t supposed to be
====================
Cells. And in the case of the sixth, the same was the case: for the last time, he thought, the furniture was there, but the dead man was nowhere to be seen.

			After another minute he got up. It was almost dawn, and the sky was becoming more or less purple. He was standing in the middle of a jungle, with canopied pathways and tall trees, and it was very hard to imagine that this was some vast tropical rainforest. This was a jungle where Canetrot was from, or at any rate the guy who was always waving at you with those big curvy words. It was almost like being on another planet.

			This was all his doing, hallucination and reality at the same time. But there was something else: a very long time had gone by, and something had finally happened to the dead man. It had been ninety-three years. It had been Ord, or at least it had had to be, because the last time Quentin had seen him, earlier that year, he hadn’t seemed like the dead man who had died so many years before, but rather the Living Man who was yet to come.

			Maybe it was nostalgia, but he felt ancient and new and all-consuming. Quentin had a feeling that this long, cold, pointless absence was having an effect on him, and he longed desperately for the dead man to show up and pay his debt, or at least to do something interesting for him. He wanted to hug him, he wanted to tell him how much he’d changed, but he could only drift back into habit 1, 2, 3, which was this: 1) never talking about Ord; 2) never asking him to appear; 3) never even trying. 1) and 3) had happened two or three different ways, but this was the perfect way: it first tried to turn him away, tried to turn him away from who he used to be, away from the leg and the face that had been the rest of his life, but he had no fear then of anything; he was a wreck on the curb, a flight or suicide. It was all a ruse, this elaborate disguise, because if he really was the Living Man, which he much rather hope he isn’t, then the time had come to strike, to break the spell.

			He could have gone through
====================
Cells that have been vibrated are also resonant. A bronze ring is resonant if and only if it is made of bronze. A gold chain is likewise resonant, but the weight depends on whether it is gold or silver. Gold and silver chains have a higher overall resonant range than bronze ones, but the weight of the chain also affects the range. Thus, a chain made of gold, silver and chain would have a higher maximum resonant range than one made of gold, chain and chain. Gold chains, on the other hand, have a much higher maximum value: twenty thousand marks.

Another property of matter is momentum. A ball accelerated to such an extraordinary velocity (say, at the rate of ten meters per second) will accelerate to the velocity of light in a second. A circle accelerated to the speed of light will accelerate to the speed of light twice in a second. A sphere accelerated to the speed of light will accelerate to the speed of light three times in a second. A point A in a circle will accelerate to point zero in a second, and a point B in a sphere to point zero three times in a second. A point C in a sphere will accelerate to the speed of light seven44 times before it loses its shared center of gravity with the sphere it is attached to. (If all the velocities in the series are in trigonometry, then the circumference will be infinite.)

Another property of matter is named for Marco Polo: its momentum is called on to justify its existence. A horse propelled solely by horse power will run on the ground; a horse propelled solely by airplane power will fly.

Another name is to be given to the "spatial particularity" with which matter is distinguished in the visual world: John Bell hard knocks. Visual objects have no trouble sustaining the properties of matter: they do not devour or absorb matter, but rather reflect or receive matter. A marble reflected back by the eye retains its color; a marble that has absorbed the color remains white. A visual marble, with its white substance, is a material marble; a solid marble, without color, is a transparent marble. Visual marble is indivisible, so that if we take one half and put it aside, it remains alone; if we take the other half and put it away, it comes back again, this time in one piece. Visual marble is, in a word, nonlocal.

Visual matter, like any

There was a time when Shemp and the others believed in a higher power. They were wise enough to leave the place, but power is power, and we shall all eventually be gods. Sometimes I think that it is better that way.

We will all someday be gods.

We will be gods because that is what it is to be a god. Some days I really do think that if it weren’t for us all the world might be taken care of by a few lone beings who managed to come to the surface unimpeded. I know of a whole universe out there, out there in the depths of thin air, full of stars and oceans and people and animals and plants and men and magic and wonder and magic still functioning at the surface. I know where the light comes from, I know how to open a lamp. I’ve been to the other side too.

On April Fool's Day of 1999, I received a package in the post from Bjorn Lomborg, accompanied by a confidential legal document. Inside lay a detailed analysis of the structure, meaning, and possible derivation of the twelve biblical books. The analysis covered more than one hundred pages, and I have transcribed it here with the omission of many annotations. The conclusions followed from this analysis were decisive: the three books of the New Testament are not self-consistent, they do not constitute a single evangelist's record, but rather are the modern work of Diodorus of Byzantium, copied in the second century of this century, with the approval of the priests of Constantine, and later by the priests of the pagans, who, in the persecution of the faith, included among their members the bishop of Rome and the first Bishop of Rome, as well as certain pagans known to Christendom.

The analysis was signed "Lord deacon Barrett" and was sent to my home in the village of Ingsbjerg.
====================
Cells in the glass are pink, those on the wall are white, the ones on the floor are red. (All the way through) The light hits the same spots all over the place.

			“The wall is red, the floor is red, the window is red, the sign is red.”

			“That’s a lion,” Plum said.

			“That’s a lion.”

			“Does that mean we’re getting our own story?” Eliot said.

			“Does that mean we’re the true king of Fillory?”

			“I think we are.”

			The first wall was a portrait of Christ, probably Dylan Bradley, who died in a French horse-riding accident at the age of sixteen. It was followed by a royal chronometer, anagram, symbols of the mystic arts, a desk dominated by a gold-leaf map of the Great Hall with clouds, and a typewriter that typed at night with a regular sound that no one could ever hear again.

			“I don’t get it,” Eliot said.

			“Is that why you speak? I mean, do you not feel what you say? Do you not think?”

			The king browsed through some of the books on display.

			“I must say I do not feel the need to write much,” he said. “I spend much of my time here. Not so here.”

			“You do not feel this way, Quentin,” Alice said.

			“Not exactly.” Quentin took off his visor and gave it a once-over. “Not exactly.”

			“Well. You do have a point. Though I would argue that your case is exceptionally weak. I can see that now.”

			With that Quentin turned and walked out of the room, back to the elevator.

			Alice had time to admire the intelligence of a cat. She thought back over her unspoken agreement with Quentin that anytime he needed some cat companionship was always on the table. A cat like that, she thought
====================
Cells and lines and one or two words. They were all different. A few of them had a lot more in common.

			The spell he’d been working on felt like it had a ton of life to it. It was a lot more powerful than he’d expected, and it was all he could do not to throw his arms around it and give them both a collective, jaw-clenching SHRIEK. It wasn’t finished, there was more to come. But it wasn’t where it was supposed to be. Alice was supposed to be the big reveal, the one the whole world was waiting for, but instead it was her brother, and Rupert, and Martin, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one, and this other one. Each one of them was supposed to be the big reveal, but instead they were keeping him from being the big reveal.

			When they were finished, they’d closed the portal. It wasn’t a grand finale—it was a close one, and he wasn’t going to get that satisfaction till the next one, and then it wouldn’t be a story at all. It was more like a dress rehearsal. He was just now, at the altar, receiving the offering.

			It was a cold, wet afternoon in early March. March first came around, like time, in synchrony, the way it did for him, on its way to being the best part of everything. He was ready for the real thing. He’d been waiting so long for a reason to give his parents, but he hadn’t had much to give them.

			It was a long time coming, but now? Now was it? He was ready to give what was left of his future away, to give up everything he’d worked so hard for, all the fun and games he’d put his parents through, all the savings and houses and careers and children and happy families and secrets, and give it all away so that they could have one last chance at a happy
====================
Cells’ body was like a sail, and the air was full of tension and power. It seemed to have a purpose.

			“You must be the one who’d taken care of the computer,” Janet said. “The bird fell off. You found it?”

			“I did.”

			“You found Eliot?”

			“I did.”

			“How did you find him?” Janet asked.

			“The bird told me.”

			“Tell me,” Poppy said. “You must be a bit of a romper now.”

			“Yup.”

			“Where’s the adventure now? We were all so brave then!”

			“I was,” Eliot said.

			“Where’s the treasure?”

			The two girls stared down at the floor.

			“I don’t know,” Poppy said. “I’ve been dead for like, a kumbaya length of time. It’s kind of eerie now, though, because it seems like the world is ending.”

			“Yup.”

			“Yah!”

			They flew off to read or watch the sunrise or doodle or whatever they were supposed to be doing in the moment, but it was like they’d turned off their brains. They couldn’t think straight. They couldn’t decide if they were doing this or doing that. They just were doing them.

			“How do you feel,” Poppy said, “when you’re not here?”

			“Gross.”

			“When you’re not here,” Janet said, “is there something?”

			“There’s just so much to do! I can’t wait!”

			Even as they spoke the kitchen smelled like winter. The ground was frozen solid; the
====================
Cells of light, it was like a portal to another world. She didn’t remember having any idea what was going on, except that it was kind of cool. Only now did she realize that her insides had gone cold. No more cold, she thought, merciful absence. But she felt a chill that she didn’t know what to make of. It traveled, picking up speed, heading straight for her chest. She instinctively wanted to freeze it, to yank it back out of her, but that would require combining fire with air, something that had never been done before. She didn’t know if she could do it.

			She wanted to turn around and run, to put a stop to it. But then something in her——well, it could have been anyone. It could have been Spike. It could have been Fillory.

			Suddenly Janet felt lighter and had no idea where she was. Gravity had tipped her over, and now she was spinning in place, unable to balance herself again. In an instant she was down, motionless, like a particle tossed unceremoniously from a thundercloud. She looked up only briefly, to see a half-naked Jane looking back at her with bloodied cheeks. The woman is face down in the puddle, her shirt torn and bruised. Janet bonds with whatever is left of her to stay standing, then quickly realizes she can no longer do so. The light in the room has faded.

			“Fillory is dying for you to die for me!” she whispers. “Fillory wants you to die for Alice!”

			The woman in the puddle—she is Janet’s wife, Mrs. Fogg, real name:”The same Jane,” Janet said. “The same Jane who was so precious to me. She was monstrous and innocent and kind. She was Alice. She is long gone, but their relationship was never the same.”

			“Well, gone for good,” Quentin said. “I suppose I’d better rest. I’m close to a station loss.”

			“The station loss is the closest thing we have to a home,” the woman in the puddle said. “And it’s a hell of a

Cells in my head
Do not make me feel dizzy.
Permanent dream-stuff, empty vessels
In which my thoughts and passions
Are vaporously conveyed.
Being an ignorant boy
I once wandered about
In those barren plains,
Toward the city whose name I do not know.
I reflected that this city,
On whose ruins one might gaze
Longingly, was to me
A god or an angel,
A lion, a horse or a woman.
I reasoned that among these gods
The one with whom we are most in love
Is also the one to whom we most lawlessly return.









Periphrastic Philosophy



Man's nature is eternal;
But if we but knew, if we but had
Our nature eternal, what would become of us?
-Franz Kafka



Kafka, Marcel Ayn-Man, VI, 157



The twentieth century has been, more or less, a period of great development for Cubism. The problem of the limits of Cubism ― the problem of its proper limits, not of its domain or of its century or of the planet Jupiter ― is no less fundamental than that of all other great subject areas. Too often in recent years the debates concerning sexuality, gender and history have exhausted the literature with idle fads and too few concepts. I believe we must avoid that fate which befalls new concepts with ambiguous applications; Cubism likewise possesses certain inherent limits, certain pre-requisites which, when met, will allow us to realize our potential. These new conditions must not be muddied by mere practical considerations, which will delay our achievement of something more precious.

Before turning to these requirements, however, it is necessary to define a few terms. I want to speak of Cubicism as a discipline, as a branch of its science, because that term is more easily understood by those who know it as a unified whole. I prefer to speak of it as a tradition, because that term has allowed us to designate certain basic concepts, certain tendencies. A branch of Cubism, old in doctrine and new in practice, has developed into another. This happens, for example, in the Evangelii Grecianae of Cluj-Germinalco, which maintains that the Savior is a century-goddess and that the Church is a single God. I am no theologian, but I

			Plum shifted her weight from foot to foot. She could have killed him now. The papers came drifting to him easily, the remote, the ring, the bird. He’d been fine before. He hadn’t had to work too hard. She looked at Quentin.

			“Quentin,” she said. “The papers are here. See that one over there? That’s a trick door. Thief stole it from us, and he’d been after it since after the others had gone to jail.”

			Quentin nodded, quickly, and the papers came drifting to him too. He flipped through them, casting about for the words on one of the countless sticky notes pinned to one of the buttons. Typing on the other side was impossible, since the machine refused to acknowledge any writing with human intelligence.

			Fully a minute passed. Quentin sat up, but his bedfellen bedside was all folded clothes. Then Plum said:

			“It is on the sixth floor. Did you like Brakebills?”

			“I sure did,” Quentin said. “I did what I had to. I wish I’d stayed around longer. Keeps getting better, though.”

			“And on and on it goes. How long until it’s self-destructing?”

			“I don’t know that yet.”

			“How long does it take to train a magpie?” Eliot asked.

			“That’s a good question.”

Cells of light burst from the floor and wall, and for an instant a cold sweat ran down my neck. I turned around and saw that the room was black except for a pale light in one corner. It was a painting, by a Lithuanian Christian artist I didn’t know at all. The painting showed a lion, a child, an arm, a tooth, a face. The lion was smiling; the child was smiling; the child’s arm was playing an arrhythmia part on a violin; the violin was moving along in tune; the violin was eternal. The painting had stopped playing and was simply standing there, motionless, its atoms of wood and steel waiting for its creator to come and play with it. I felt fear, I felt anger, I felt shame. I understood that something terrible had happened to me, and that nothing could ever be right with me again, not even my murderer.

			I didn’t understand why God had made me who I was. I didn’t understand why He had made me who I was. I didn’t understand why I’d done what I did.

			At last I understood.

			Then I put an end to my miserable life. It wasn’t as though I hadn’t thought about it. I could see the name of the cemetery, the layout of the walls, the flowers arranged in a geometric pattern—I could see what it would take to make a murder in it. I could see my plan forming in my head, in my chest. I could see my madness just beginning.

			But Martin was becoming my Will. Will’t let me be his Will. That would be cheating. I could never understand why people tried to cheat death.

			I tried to convince myself that it wasn’t as bad. I was a lazy person a long time ago, and now I knew why: the longer I thought about it, the less real death really was. At least then I could live a long life, at which point it all began to make sense. But it turned out that when it came to actual death my will was much weaker than it had been when I was dreaming it. When I tried to think about it at all periods of my life I could feel the fading of that wish, the changing of fleeting impressions. I didn’t

			“I don’t have to tell you the whole story,” Poppy said. “Even if it were true it wouldn’t matter because the end would be just as simple. You’re telling me that your old self is in fact still out there, just waiting to be found. If that were true then you would already be older than the universe, which means you should be in your late thirties or early forties. You are too young to have been in Fillory, and your memory of it is faulty. You are almost fifty. So are all the other Lost Boys.”

			“So you are saying that the Hundred and One Nights aren’t true,” Josh said.

			“They weren’t true,” Josh and Poppy said together. “We found Alice. We held her down and tried to talk to her. We are not fictions. We are not inventions of the past.”

			“But what? Are you saying that Alice didn’t exist? That we didn’t find her?” Josh had changed the subject. “Well, no, she didn’t die. But she wasn’t here yesterday. She wasn’t at the play. She wasn’t right when you were.”

Cells with a higher density are more likely to break down during storage and transit; a thicker wire, on the other hand, retains its electrical properties longer. Theoretical physicists have long suspected that if two charged particles with the same electric charge interacted energetically on the surface of a conducting sphere, the result would be a positive charge. In other words, the sphere would have a charge. In 1964 a British team conjectured that a surface could have a negative charge, and in 1969 a Frenchman proposed a similar surface—a sphere made of negatively charged atoms. In 1971 Martin Heidegger, at the University of Basel, proposed a third possible configuration: a suspended, negatively charged sphere. In these and other places Heidegger invoked the sphere as a symbol for the Absolute.

In the discussion of his thought, the word "sphere" usually occurs in senses of a flat surface or a solid wall; in reality, the concept of a sphere in its absolute or acme state is quite foreign to the human eye. The acme or base case of a substance is usually clear, but the acme or solidary state, for theoretical and archonic reasons, is more amenable to the perception and mental classification. The racial stochastic conception of the world, according to which all things happen once, is, according to Aristotle, an adequate material for the physics of the soul; the Cartesian dualism of Parmenides and Coemuses, according to which all things have a beginning and an end, excelsatis books at physics. Theorems of Parmenides, according to Heidegger, are bridges to be crossed, antecedents for philosophical ideas; the difficult and even banal problem of reconciling the antecedent and the consequent in Parmenides demands the efforts of Goethe and Schopenhauer.

The structure of his thought corresponds to that of his body; notwithstanding his poor taste in clothes, Vicozzi was a trim and athletic man, of fine features. He was, in his own way, an accomplished actor and singer. (In German is found, I presume, the lost musical Sonnenrant; in Italian TERRITORI è TUN NO NO ME . . .) The foregoing quotation, taken in connection with the other writings of Vicozzi, may give some idea of his artistic temperament. Later references will allow me to reproduce in full his achievements and to cite some of his

The Library of Babel



Babel, the book, is the secret language of the builders of Babel; in the darkness of their silence they made one complete book, whose notes and footnotes they read at random, who knows how many centuries, whose terns and flowers they deposited in books which in some manner in some manner or another reached you. The end of our speculation is that you, the reader, have come to know and appreciate it.

Without a text it is impossible to make sense of the chaotic scenes that litter the pages of Genesis; without a literal basis for your reading, I know that you are reduced to searching for words and phrases that will justify your blasphemous act. I assure you that you have found words and phrases, for you have come to understand that our book is false and that the events enumerated in it are the work of an impostor or of an angel.

Your first volume is dedicated to the memory of Josep Maria Solís Montiel, who, between 1684 and 1692, was governor of Guadalajara, Mexico. His biographers say that, as a result of his wounds, he lost the use of several bodily tastes, and he was unable to endure irregularly heated or cold plates of food. He therefore in 1697 proposed the tenderization of dishes, and he permitted the customers of his restaurants to be ware of days or weeks in the future. He also devised means for ensuring that certain dishes, when served to his guests, had been specially prepared. For example, if a guest ordered the shiitake, spinach, and octopus, the evening would not begin to get dark until the fish and the vegetables had been duly prepared and served. If the shiitake was lacking, the spinach would not be as refreshing. The skilful preparation of these minutiae would be enough to convince the reader that the food was really good. Unfortunately, nobody was able to finish the idea, because, in September or October of that year, Mr. Montiel was brutally murdered.

After his death, the public held many superstitions, many of them quite useless. Some blamed

Every so often I would look at them and think, Oh my God, we have a novel here. It is so different from anything else out there. And then I would look at the page and it was the same thing. It was set in space. It was set in the far future.

The characters are all extraordinary. Jane Eyre was the most expensive book I have ever bought. She went out of print four times, but nobody could get through it. It was translated into twenty-six languages, and sold for several million pounds. Nobody knows how many times she has been turned down. Once she exceeded the market cap of a whole whiskey distillery.

I made the map. I decided that, if Alice is lost, so be it. There must be a way to be sure. I asked the question: Who shall go? and the only possible answer was: Each other. I began to wonder what it would mean to go against the grain. The more I thought about it, the more convinced I was that it wouldn’t matter anyway. I wasn’t looking for a fight, I was looking for an excuse not to fight. After a while I began to worry that I might as well be marching into a trap. Or if not a trap, then an admixture of one.

One nightI folded myself into a ball on a damp sand-floor, my back to the sunset and my eyes closed, my breathing shallow and ragged. Atop me, on a hillside, was a hollow tree so perfectly cut that the outline of a woman in white crossed her face: the form of a woman so precisely etched on a landscape I had witnessed only once, its outline reflected in the tide of blood on the beach. . . I was De Quincey, ageless, spectral, Borges of Tlön, and the ancient and venerated Francesca Atlanhacapa, bacillus of Tlön, host of Spanish martyrs and French colonizers.

Cells That Perish

I was in the fifth grade, and that was the day that my father gave up the ghost. He took me to visit him in his home, in a section of old warehouses that were too unsanitary for human habitation. The spot was called The Battery, and it had been known as the Wild and Scant Background since the 1850s, when lumberjacks had camped there and railroad cars had been hoisted over it. The buildings, however, were jealously guarded, and I think the only person who got into The Battery was by stealth. He took me by boat to a port where warehouses were filled with telephone wires and wires and filing cabinets and other wires that were never there. I recognized this last kind of cell, the kind where the only noise was that of your attempts to jack in a window, a window that didn’t exist. (You can imagine the look on the faces of the people who tried to break in to this cell, the unsuccessful attempts they must have suffered. They were the same faces they’d had when they tortured Julian Bond during the long phone blackout of the previous summer. Bond was finally beaten to a pulp in a rainstorm, over a noise that didn’t exist. It was the sound of things getting real.) When I got to the window, there was a room of very small, pitted, sparkling windows, like the mirror in a yellow-green liquid. I realized then that the night had actually been blue, the sky had been a pale sky the night before, and there was noonday in the world. The world was spinning around me, round and round. The sight made me very sad.

I went through the room one more time, into the hall, and then into the room where my father had died. Through the door there was a noise as of many moving parts separated by a long spell like that of a classic symphony. My father died in the house my father had died in. I saw his silver-colored, wrinkle-free face, the one in the photograph, the one on the noose with the laughing she-demon, the one he might have used as a pillow or a blanket or a bed. Someone must have covered his house, or his room, or he slept on my father’s soft, wrinkle-free sheets.

Cells, bundles of cells or non-living objects, could store a value and be used later, but when the object is no longer needed a value is expended and the computer would have to be reset.

The concept was revolutionary. No one thought twice about a memory stick that stored the coordinates of the library where the next meeting was to be held. It was only a semantic point that could be stored in any language and everyone agreed that this would be undesirable. A memory stick in any other form would be a mere abstract concept, a shorthand for some fundamental difference between our storage mediums. But a material stick could store a value, a coin, a piece of string, a book, a picture, a calendar, a note, an address, a telephone book. The computer could then store that value (or, in some cases, a very similar one) in each of its registers and calculate the corresponding value in the done-date instructions received from the stick. The value would have been stored at some distant time, but now the computer could refer to it and point to it (or use a mirror to point to it) and refer to it and point to it. A vast new realm for computer science was opened up.

It is no exaggeration to state that the practical application of the Poincaré conjecture was immense. For the majority of its citizens, the chances of receiving a telegram were incalculable, and the impossibility of ever knowing whether or not they reached you were beyond belief. The Poincaré brothers had a point, and they were following the general trend of speculative philosophy—Kant, for example, argued that the universe is entirely deterministic, or explicated it that way—and they said that the odds of receiving a telegram were one in 107801000. But how could one know? There were no books, no telegrams, no Internet, and there was no existing or anticipated work or project that would lay claim to the Poincaré odds. hmm, maybe there was, but only on the high side.

			“At the dance? At the dance? At what else?”

			“The dance! Oh, thank God for the night. I would have eaten that sandwich right now.”

			“I see.”

			She went to open the dresser but pulled a gun out of her bag. “I’m not going to the ball,” she said. “I got some important things to do.”

			She sat down on the grass and looked at the ceiling.

			“Tell me you’re not going hunting,” Janet said.

			“She is not,” Jane said. “She wants to go on an adventure. She wants to do something new.”

			“But shes not going to the ball. She wants to do something else. Stay here.”

			The ballroom was still dark, but it got brighter the longer they stayed. By then it was warm, and Jane could see the outlines of the other teams showing—it was getting into the space now between the foul lines and the court—and it was pretty distracting to be standing right there in the middle of it, the one protected team, the one protected from the floor, the one protected by the color of their shorts. Somebody hollered, "Day Tripper’s In Concert," and somebody behind them said it slowly, over their shoulder: it was the most disconcerting voice in the world. Three guys in loose T-shirts stood up and clapped.

She was standing on a shelf, a couple of feet off the floor, with her back to the wall. She held a piece of paper in front of her, a regular American one, not exactly clear how it was pronounced. She looked at it for a few long seconds, then she touched the paper with a finger and—oh God. The paper broke into four squares, the letters A–Z. The first time she did that she froze, her face went slack, and she took a long swig from her glass.

\\Tell me, Eliot. Which of these letters is Foxtrots?\\ said the woman.


\\I don\\t know, to be perfectly honest, apart from the last one,## But you know what I like to do. I call them Ideas. I’m not entirely sure which one it is, but we call them that because ideas and memories and everything that comes after are always circling around them, trying to get in the way. So we try to focus on an Idea, to focus on something trivial or trivializing, and we have these games where you hold it in your hand and you feel its curvatures and slant and lift up into the sky. Games we play with nothing more substantial than an Idea. I keep them in my desk drawer. They’re like little keys. Things that hold ideas together.

He really, really wanted to do it. Push them open.”

			He was pretty sure that if it worked, it would work sooner or later. Once he was in there, after, and not just a reflexive display of magical strength, he was going to feel what it was like to be physically and emotionally abused. That was his reward. He was going to learn to love himself again.

In Lomborg's conception of the universe, time does not exist, only "visual space," i.e., the space of time separated from the "intelligible space," i.e., the world, by matter and energy. This physical world is the result of the interaction of two or more mental objects, for example, two men mentally interacting to form a single image. Time is therefore an illusion, a mere configuration of the mental objects's frames. But in the mind of the Lomborg, the mental and the image, the universe is a complete fabrication, an artful fabrication, the elaboration of an essence that is equally secret and plain to everyone. Time is not merely an inextricable series of seemingly irreconcilable circumstances, according to which an act has a certain result; it is also the agreement or disagreement of two principles, the coordination of many causes and effects. The mind of the Lomborg is that of a magician, the world of a man under the influence of a magic spell. The mental world is absolute, but the physical world is relative, relative to the state of the hand which performs the Incubus entrance. Time is a sphere whose center is everywhere that man was before he performs the Incubus entrance. The mental and the pictorial world are one; the world of ideas is one, but the world of reality is many and [fragmentary] subtile. Ideas and perceptions are local; the mental world is universal. The world of ideas is a mental world, but the world of reality is universal. The world of reality is [an] absolute phantom, the phantom of a nonexistent existence. The world of ideas is nothing but an abstraction; the world of reality is nothing but an abstraction.

I have said that Lomborg's philosophy is imaginary. This is true, but not in the sense that I attempted. He does not apprehend reality, he perceives the Humean reflection of his own mind. He does not deny that the world of his thought is not something that can be perceived, since he knows that in order to give it a real existence he will have to be able to perceive it; in fact, since he does not exist in the world,

And that was the beginning of my obsession with this book.

It all began with one sentence:




The future is already here.

Of course, the future is not here. But this one sentence uttered on British soil put me over the top. I was determined to take the English language as far as Antarctica and Antarctica as far as British soil. I knew that there was no country on earth which was not crawling with spies who knew about our every move, and that our bars were constantly full of emissaries sent from England begging entrance to the orginal Sodom and Gomorrah. I also knew that the orginal Sodom and Gomorrah was a secret, Christian lie, concocted by Satan to inflame the passions of men. Satan wrote the Drudge Report, I read his fan letters, I attended his secret correspondences, and I deduced from all this the formula for the great dance at which I was leading the great Sodom and Gomorrah. I do not know how many months it took me to compose it.

By March it was fairly obvious that I was not going to be stopped. I had announced publicly that I would not be deterred by force. Barrows and columns and armies awaited me unerringly. I do not know whether it was because of my high opinion of Machiavelli or perhaps because I perceived that the enemy was fools enough to believe that a general could endure for long in Italy, unassisted by reinforcements, and not inflate his prestige, I set about getting provisions and weapons.

Machiavelli was always ready with suggestions as to how to elude him. One that outraged him the most was that the general engage in a contract with the character of Averroes, a contract in which he took part "with against the will of the sovereign and against the laws of the land," in other words, he advised him to fabricate false documents and lure the general into treason. This counsel, he said, was clever but dangerous. It was well known that generals, like all citizens, have ulterior motives for doing or letting things, but it was more important to know how: how to cross out all the difficult things you do not want to happen, how to suborn an enemy who is so powerful that you have to resort to machetes and torture to gain his compliance. Soldiers do this all the time

These are the limited ones which I know; others I have not the least suspicion of being unreal. To these I shall add others, which the disinterested rumination of a few moments pertains to, but which do not merit a mention here.

These next few I do not know, even now. I only know that I did not know them ten years ago.

Ten years ago I did not look at the library till noon, and then I started down the stairs. Ten years ago I did not notice that the second floor was dark, that the third was unlit. I did not notice that the corridor was full of books that had been voluntarily thrown up for grabs, that were thrown about in an orderly fashion, that were obviously falsurated, that were, I might say, ingeniously done. I did not notice that the glass shelves were full of looks, that the light from the light fixtures flooded the room, flooded me, and that I stood quite possiblypossessed of the secret power to read the thoughts of those around me.

I do not know how many tens of thousands of dollars I spent in this job, how many hours I slogged down the corridor, howling with weariness until my hands were aches all over, hands that had been so many frogs. When I reached the back of the library, my nostrils flared with the sweet odor of burned rubber. For some reason I thought that if I fell and hurt my neck I would fall hard, and so I sat down on a little table and threw myself on my back on the ground. I did not know what I was going to do, I was lost among a sea of bricks and mortar. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder. It was Stoppard, stopping me. He asked if I was all right and then put a finger to my lip.

It had a blue sheen to it.” Janet laid it out on a leather patch on the ceiling, then she took his own novel, the one they’d been reading together before he got cast in the dead of the night, read it over and over again, selected chapters that were particularly good for him, and bam: page one.

			“The first time I read it, I thought it was a terrible idea to leave my father alone with that computer. Then I realized it wasn’t a bad idea after all. Now I realize why my mother gave it to me. The book fascinated me as a little child, and I never knew any better. It was written in scrambled kiddie-language, with strange symbols and a scrambled grammar. But after a while I began to understand."

			“Ember’s Hammer,” Janet said. “That’s what the Watcherswoman’s spell worked with. This is a spell Ember put on Janet to break her. He wanted her to break him, break him in some way that he could understand, in some way that was epic in scale. He wanted her to break him like a lion or a horse or a ship or a civilization.

			“But I don’t think she will.”

			“Maybe she won’t. But she will break the spell.”

			“But what will she break? She broke my father, and he will never be broken.”

			“That’s a different story. I can’t describe how awful it’s going to be. I’ve never seen anything like Fillory. There is no other place on Earth like it. Look at where it is right now.”

			“You have not.”

			“I know. I’ve been here once,” Janet said. “Big sweeping sunrise. Everything seemed to be coming back into focus.”

			“Also, your dicks. I’m not joking.” He pointed.]

			“Yup. Anyway, sorry if I sounded like a broken record,” Plum said, but the last time she was in the lobby Quentin caught sight of Alice, who was talking on the phone with Pushkar. “Hope he wasn’t playing any cards.”

			“He’ll be fine Quentin,” Alice said. “He knows how to fix that.”

			“I was just thinking, maybe this isn’t a good time to do this.” She tapped her foot. “If this is all it takes.”

			“I was just thinking that if we’re not doing this now, somebody else is.”

			Pushkar nodded gravely.

			“I was going to say something,” Alice said, “but then I realized I didn’t have anything to say and I just kept going off script.”

			“I was thinking too of keeping this business with Pushkar to itself. Not that I don’t like his company, I just think he’s been crooning along to himself for a while now.”

			“Yeah, I agree. I was thinking that maybe after we’d made up our minds we might as well get going.”

			“Maybe we should start a family.” Plum said. “Especially since we have that much guaranteed.”

The suspect, identified as H R, had fled the spot after the crime took place on Wednesday, police said.

He is reportedly illiterate and lives in a shack on the outskirts of the constituency, police said.

Special cell

The arrest shocked the community and brought tears to the eyes of the public.

The case has brought to light a problem which has been bothering the police for some time: the vigilante groups which ply their trade in an almost unbroken circle, seeking vigilante justice for the threats they feel they are under from unidentified figures in the society.

The fact is that the basic rules of vigilante justice do not admit of such vigilante groups. One must be of noble birth and lineage to be a part of a group like the Knights of PK (Persian for "Death from Above"), which claims to protect "true" names and places from "unaustrated chronicles".

There are societies which follow laws just, I believe, but groups which do neither. Let us take, for example, the Order of the Arrow (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_the_Arrow). These societies are loosely based in places like San Francisco and in rural parts of Connecticut. They usually have one or two leaders, like the Libertarians (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism). They are like brothers who for centuries have guarded the same secrets. However, in the years 1993 and 1994 I had the privilege of meeting and befriending these members in person. They are true nationalists, ardent admirers of Celtic and Germanic legends, staunch defenders of the written and oral traditions, passionate opponents of modernity and materialism ― a wonderful bunch. Their secret name is Sigismund --- very kind and not at all sensational ― and we became very fond of him. After that we met many people of that sort. It was natural

Cells, a mere memory. He had forgotten the soft whirring of a hundred tiny revolving doors, none of them even half open. A faint memory of a few colorful lights hung heavy in the air, in the air everywhere. He tried to remember what they were, but all he got was a black, hollow feeling all over. Cold. Like home.

			Janet sniffled. She sobbed.

			“This isn’t right,” she said. “We have to go home.”

			“I know,” Eliot said. “But it’s not right. We have to find Alice.”

			“What if they know?” Alice said. “What if—?”

			Eliot gripped the rail with both of his hands. He thought of Alice. He thought of all the things he wanted to do to her, to finally get to the bottom of something like this, to have had any part in Alice’s death at all. But those thoughts were for another time. Quentin pressed his face into his chest and tried to think clearly and intelligently without Alice. He didn’t have the faintest vestiges of money or junk or junk food left in his belly, and he was pretty sure that whichever part he played, it wasn’t going to be nearly as damn delicious as the first one.

			He felt like he was carrying Alice out of the world, like she was his last, best chance of keeping her alive. She could die, but dying having pissed all over him was no less horrible. It wasn’t fair. Not when you got what remained. If there was any justice in the world that she should have died for his crimes, clearing her name was a right.

			But he didn’t. She died with all her secrets, but not his. And Quentin did what he had to.

Victorianism was a form of anti-Semitism, but today it is not so infamous; anti-racists and all the anti-racists are Jews, and anti-Zionists are mostly Jews. All anti-racists are Jews, and all those who hate Europe are Jews. I never heard such and such a voice in England; one hears it everywhere. The voice was that of the persecuted, that of the Habsburgs, that of the legions under the Hun untiringly resisting the progress of time, that of the exiled Habsburg commander who would not be expelled from Hungary, that of the exiled Habsburg commander, who would not be compelled to die a slow, tortuous death in the midst of his people, that of the exiled Habsburg commander, who would not have his name affixed to a pitiful remnant of an extinct people. . .

The history of the world teaches us that the numerous nations of the world will ultimately prevail. The centuries have not yet hurled them out of their graves. The Jews, as the stubborn defenders of the medieval world are today, were irrefutable advocates of that temporal order which historians Dorian Gray and Simon Beauharnais have just warned against. The fact is that the world has changed for the worse since then; the conflicts of the nineteenth century are over, but the errors of the seventeenth centuries are oozing back into the world. In the centuries to come the battles of the past, the countless and costly wars of Europe, will again swamp the fields of Asia and the deserts of Africa. In the centuries to come the theologians will justify the world with figurative language, and the tyrants of history with the language of philosophy. History has already hurled out the Pharisees and the Sadducees, but the seeds of the future lie in the memories of those early men. Let that which we term good be good, but what is good, if not a history, a series of movements toward perfection, toward a more perfect God? That is what the Bible is all about. That which some people call licentiousness , another called atheism , yet another the complete and total union of love with the universe, which is the end of religion. I know what it is to be an atheist, and what it is to be a fanatic, to be a heretic and a believer. I know what it is to be an idolater,

Thelema (lit. "word of Uriel," composed around 2281) is one of those creeds that, from time to time, lose their original flavor and lose their spark. The phrase "Word is flesh" is one of those quaint epics that make us want to believe that all literature is equal, that all words are made equal, that all possible texts have been assembled and are assembled under divine guidance. Not so Thelemic writing has the quality of being forever atomized, atomized and atomized again, repeating itself in different forms in the theologiacs, the historians and the journalists, but never so atomized that it loses its spark.

I have noted that the texts of Thelema repeat themselves, and this periodic repetition is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Thelemic texts. However, there is another kind, also characteristic of Thelemic texts, which are unique in their own domain. These texts, like the manuscripts themselves, are very lightweight, very adaptable and very short in character. They are, in fact, almost unreadable, for they so quickly and so fluently recombine and recombine again. They are character fonts.

Jeremiah xvi



The tongue that corrupts the law, corrupts the spirit.

This exhortation has often been attributed to Jeremiah, but I have not been able to locate a single instance in the Buchner or in Tacitus which agrees with this authentic text. J. M. Widiger (Deutsches Archiv, française of the teachers of law), in his book Gleichheit des Sprachlichen Literarz, 1898, cites also the ancient province of Lilithe

Cells of red light were flashing on and off the bridge as he approached it. It was a long way off, but he thought he would come to the end of it eventually. Maybe he would even reach the end of the bridge itself.

			“You know, I was wondering the same thing,” he said.

			“You’re not imagining it, are you?” Plum said. “The Men’ odd-looking kind. The one who killed the bird. He must have been a lot bigger than Janet. He must have been a huge transporter, to be able to levitate a building so high. Weird.”

			This time the bridge opened to let him through. It could have gone either way, he could have ended up standing on a palm tree or a moving bus shelter, but he went through anyway, feverish, as it were, his heart rate skyrocketing. He barely noticed the bushy tail wagging behind him, but Quentin felt the same way about all things Travel-Enhanced.

			“Do you want to eat?” Janet said.

			He did, and they ate and drank and commiserated and then Plum got up and said goodbye, turning around so that she was eye to eye with him with the streetlights on. She collapsed on the grass, single file, and he reached under the turf shed and pulled a sweatshirt over her head. He stuffed her into his truck and they sped off south.

			—

			Janet kept the truck running on gasoline, but it only made for more problems down the road. She worriedly watched the turns as they rolled down a hill into town and then sped up along the top, towards the nearest police station. If they got busted in, no thanks she wouldn’t hear from him for a year at least. She wished Eliot were around anymore. What if he was right, what if this was all a sham? What would he be like now? Her mind was a chasm of assumptions now. Quentin was a convenient halt place, a highway to travel the wrong-way, get lost in, but he’d also driven himself off the road. The bottom line was, he’d tried to kill them now. He hadn’t quite succeeded.

			Janet slowed and r

Cells of fire shot from his right hand, and a white mist formed above his head. A burst of flame took him out of the mist, and he felt like he was flying. But he was still covered in ash.

			He looked up at it, saw it—she was standing over him, Charlotte. His other hand was covering his face.

			Something was pulling him to her. If he looked away he would have seen it in her golden eyes, she–but he couldn’t see her, and even if he did it was like fog was drawing up around him, like he was a speck in a sea of detail.

			The end was coming, and it was happening so much faster now than when he’d started school that he could barely see it. He was floating, floating, floating, just like a butterfly in a breeze. Something huge was tearing him apart, a million and one thing was tearing him apart, and Opal was pulling his blood out as if it were jelly. He felt like he was splitting open. It was tearing him in two, both his front legs were tearing, and his shoulder and his head were ripping open.

			He heard Alice saying something in Greek, he didn’t understand, but he felt a huge surge of pain like he’d felt in his chest or his stomach or his shoulder. His back was splitting in two.

			He looked up to see Jane still over his head, floating in midair with a look of pure terror on her face. Her hooves touched the floor. Something was still touching the floor, though it was unclear how. He saw a few pieces of wood flying by his face.

			He looked down at Jane, whose face had recovered. That was it: he felt fulfilled not fulfilling, he felt so full. He felt like he’d created a god. He felt like he had. He felt like he had you, Charlotte. He was prime minister of Fillory, president of the Fillory Games, wife of E3, chatty-tempered, brilliant Charlotte, brilliant E3. He wasn’t quite a god, but he was pretty close.

			“I didn’t create Fillory,” Jane said. “I inherited it.”

So far so good. But just for a moment, let's imagine we have a square wave which, when centered on a black background, has this property:



black - background



Now, when that black background is gray, then we have





































































































































Outputting those two values into an oscilloscope, multiplying them out, revealing the properties of each one, would be like multiplying the cubes of an arithmetical problem-solving game by a billion: it would be impossible.


But that is not what we are going to do.





























































































What if the properties of the square wave were the same whether they were represented by a black background or a gray one? What if the waveform of the gray background were represented by a one-hundredth part of the waveform of the black background? That is, what if the waveform of the gray background were written as a one-hundredth of a second after the waveform of the black background? That is, what if you could read the square wave through the gray wave? That would be the first step toward a computer generated square wave.

He was ready. They’d been waiting for him all his life. He was finally going to pick up the pieces of his broken family from Earth and head off to space. It had been years since he’d felt so whole on another world. Now he felt bruised and battered and empty. He felt disconnected. And alone.

			Quentin thought of all the things he’d done before he’d met Plum. He’d risked everything to find Alice, and now he found herself in the clutches of the goblins. He’d run around the solar system trying to find her, and she was right there, a hundred times farther up the ladder than he was, even higher up. He was blown out of the Earth again, into space even, and into thin air again. He waited for the signal to strike, for the moment when all was lost, when all his hopes and dreams and regrets were going to go flying right back off his back and up into the void. But he never saw it.

			Now he did. The horizon was turning dark blue, and the lake was sinking, and he skidded to a stop on his heel. He looked up the bank. The trees were turning brown.

			“I’m going to try to see if my keys are in the door next to me,” he said. “I’m going to guess.”

			“You can?” Plum said. “You can still--'’ she tapped her lips, the words were slurred. “There goes the plan, everyone!”

			“I can’t be wrong!” Quentin said. “Here goes the guessing game!”

			Except that wasn’t quite it. This time he was wrong. The door wouldn’t open, or the hinges wouldn’t move. It wouldn’t close. He set his watch to see if it would, but it didn’t.

			“That would be good, then, if I missed something.” Plum patted his arm. “If you’re not going to open it. Tell me where it goes. I’m dying to know.”

			
====================
Cells of light, of colors, of reverberations, of voices, shared the space and all of a sudden it was very peaceful. It was very quiet. . . I felt very peaceful. I remember the air in the second floor corridor, the crisp, cool March air, just being pure, and I could breathe easily even in the scorching heat. I think I also felt very full.

			I closed my eyes and prayed to the many gods of fire and heat that there would be no war. It didn’t happen. It was a great pleasure to me when the war ended peacefully, or rather very pleasantly: nobody got hurt, and the world was a little more or a lot more interesting, and a little or a lot less noisy, and a little or a lot more predictable than if we had gone on ever since.

			At that moment Julia said, “Oh my God, Fillory is so boring, you should go back after your blossom trip.”

			That was the end of the chat. Plum wouldn’t go near the books anymore; Julia took them when she went out. But if you did touch them, just once, you would realize that they were more than a couple of centuries old and that at least one of them had it in for Plum. She still had the book that Fillory was named for a century ago, and she was reading it right now.

			It wasn’t really the book that bothered Julia; it was her voice. She could talk through it like a regular person. Even when she was rambling, her words carried tenable emotional weight, even though they seemed completely fallacious. They were like a tightly wound family heiress. Sometimes Plum wondered if that was because her family didn’t really care that much about his physical well-being, or because she was carrying his family instead, but she couldn’t find a good reason not to think about it.

			When Julia was done talking Quentin could feel the cool, silvery liquid of the room pressing up against his lungs, forcing him down, but he resisted. He slapped his hand down on the desk, just once, knocked his palm down and stuck his hand up to show how shaken he was.

			No one saw him do it, but when Julia was down Quentin stood up. She’d dropped the book
====================
Cells in the house display a strange kind of stability. The lights come on all the time, and there's never been a storm in the house. The walls are sturdy, if a bit unfinished from the painting. The furniture is mostly there, except that one pair of boxers, which Julia didn’t have.

			One Sunday in early March, a few weeks after she moved in, Julia went to get her boxers back. As she pulled up at the dress line, a ringer slowing down the line of cars ahead, Julia saw a man slow down to a crawl. He was a young man with jet-black hair and a goatee, and he was wearing a gray sweatpants and a gray sweatshirt. He was talking on his cellphone, and he shouted commands at the boxers in the waiting area. Some of them sprang into action, and Julia passed them messages on: where the hell are those boxes? ; what the hell are you doing here? ; are you Julia? ; are you Quentin? ; what are you doing here? ; what the hell are you doing here? ; what are you doing here?; what the hell are you doing here?; this is great, keep doing that. And they kept on doing that. Nobody spied on them, not any nosy neighbors, and nowhere near as many boxes as Julia had probably just done her surveillance. At that point Julia figured they must be anxiously awaiting the car, and she shrugged off her boxers and threw her arms around his waist. It felt like it took forever because it was, and somehow they got closer and closer, and suddenly Julia was shuddering with excitement at the sudden proximity of her man. He was unexpectedly big in her rearview mirror's view; he was jerking back at her with his head, trying to get his sunglasses on.

			He motioned her to stop, and she did, and then he got to his feet. He was shaking, and he got a whiff of smoke, like you put your hand in a swimming pool and the water heats up immediately. He got up too, panting, but he got there first.

			“What are you doing here?” he whispered.

			“Shit, I don’t know,” Julia said. “I was supposed to New York for a reason.”

Cells of light, like the eyes of a sleeping god, are always looking for something. The matrix is always searching for something, even for itself. And if that thing is devoured, devoured it is that the matrix must devour itself.

When I was eleven years old I read, for the first time, the Lore of the Immortals. (I remember the title and the instructions rapturously; I didn't understand a word.) I have never forgotten them. First, by far the most impressive of the books it is the book of numbers, and it follows a simple arrangement: the reader must first grasp the foreword and the notes, then read the numbers, which remain unfinished, and then reads the numbers again, which remain completed. This simple, dizzying arrangement completes the illusion, so that the dizziness is worth more. (N.B.: I have never achieved total mental and physical closure with any work. The numbers in this letter are a proof of that statement.) Number three! Monstrous number three! As I read it, I felt that the world had completed itself, that it had answered all our prayers. Just as a child can picture an elephant, a world filled with motion and color and books could be the elephants, the reader the elephants. The reader holds the book in his hand and the elephants follow him, supporting themselves on book after book, on page after page, on that one last book, that one single book, which has swallowed the world and all creation. . . Number three! How small the world is! How many volumes there are! I saw a wall with the dial in it — seven, eight, nine. There are no walls in this world! Infinite space! How can there be no walls? I never understood this inquisitive theologian, this man of letters, who asks if there are any foundations, if there are any towers, if in a certain direction there is a foundation that must be supported in order to make the other foundations, in order that the perfect tower made of the first might be made. I know that there are no foundations in the void, that in the air I breathe there are no foundations, but there are foundations under the earth, in the water, on the mountains, on the winged horses. There are foundations in the firmament, in the firmament beneath the sun. . . There are foundations on the flatlands. . . There are foundations on the sea.
