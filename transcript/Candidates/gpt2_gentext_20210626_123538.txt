The troika of austerity is one of the oldest institutions in Western civilization. The Latin word for "table" is tota, and the first chapter of the second book of the Pantagruel is, roughly, this: "All things, on the part of one who habitually studies them, produce a corresponding effect, which is then reproduced in another, which is finally reversed and so on to the next." The effectual reverse of that second maxim is called beneficiariness, since it is the case that two things which are not plebeian in their detail produce a third which is plebeian in its detail. The practice of beneficiariness is one of the symbols of Western liberal education; the existence of three such elements in three men, however, does not justify the assertion that they symbolize three essences. The application of the formula beneficiariness about doubles the pretensions of Schopenhauer; but a more exact proportionate justification accords with the circumstance that the three elements of which Schopenhauer speaks are: a) a book, b) a shelf, and c) a dialectical problem. A dialectical problem is one which assigns two alternatives, a) and b) and which answers affirmatively that a) is more beautiful than smaller and darker versions of b). Schopenhauer, it will be remembered, did not go so far as to state that a) and b) are more beautiful than smaller versions of c). Rather he stated that a) and c) are two versions of the same thing, and that b) and c) are variations on this theme. There are, in other words, no pigments which do not designate two distinct images. Schopenhauer did not say that variations on this theme are shades of reality; he said that they are tones, or "variations on the theme of a beauty." The fact that a version of a theme is more or less beautiful is a sufficient criterion of the truth of Schopenhauer's dictum. The pigments which create this theme are shades of that theme; the existence of three pigments, however, is a sufficient reason why the theme is not truth. Schopenhauer did not institute the dialectical problem; he instituted three pigments which are shades of it.4

The Mirror of Enigmas



רבשו
====================
Dialog.

The next morning, the fourth, I went down to the lower streets. I stopped at a fruit stand and bought oranges. I did not expect to find the rams, but I found others. They came from every quarter and from many countries. Some were black, some in white, some in dark browns or in vivid palimsards. All wore cloth, some on their backs, some on their legs, all with faces of a religious sort. Some, like the Arabs, I knew from my native Spain, stood on feet; some, on their heads. Most of them, like the Persians, spoke Spanish fluently. I did not recognize the men who came to theban sacrifices in the fort. I did not recognize the idolaters who burned the crosses. I met them all, and I knew them as Arabs, as merchants, as laboring people, as the various tribes of Mexico, the different dynasties, the various empires have always been to me. Not all of them spoke; some of them only spoke Yiddish, another two or three languages, and some with some Arabs only. I asked them their religion, some of them Christians, others Mohammedans. I asked them their name, they told me. I did not recognize them, but I knew their suffering, their exchange of messages, the uncertain date of that exchange. I knew their grief, their anger, their love.

Not a single one of them (and there were many who looked loathsome) spoke my language. Some of them (like the gypsies) ate meat from animals they hunted, others (like the hobbits) from plants. Some of them (like the gypsies) bathed in rivers or in the mud. Some of them (like the sycamores) slept on long cords of wood. Some of them (like the sycamores) fought with bows and arrows. Not the least one, like the gypsies, shaved his head and entered the dwelling of his companion with the view of finding out his fortune. . . Some of them (like the gypsies) celebrated a universal celebration, all of them (like the sycamores) a local one. Each community celebrated a triumph, a synod, a victory, a famine, a flight, a battle, a battle of the gods, a victory of its own, a victory of a triumph, a triumph of a triumph, a

Dialog



A



I have had the honour of being enabled to speak at least once a day for the preceding year, without fail, at a small open fireplace on the second floor of a little house on the rue de Toulon. The ambience is eclectic: there is good order, precise French, Italian, English, of the eighteenth century, of the existential type, and, occasionally, of the allegorical. The walls of the room with its many chandeliers are of olden times design; the furniture consists of a few simple couches and chairs, two long beds, a large present from one of the deceased clients, a confused and noisy network of books, a small but clear or intermittent pantomime of soldiers marching and masked jugglers performing a routine, a few cigarette butts, a hairpiece, a cloth face, a twisted or twisted paper title page, a faded or free leaf from a tome which after a week remains the same for eight pages and a bird's-eye view of a byzantine island, with its beautiful tropical trees and watery sandy water, are the only perceptible defects. Nevertheless, those who have looked upon it in person confess that the house and its few residents are almost miraculous. To the untutored eye they are utterly ordinary; to the expert eye they are prodigious. I have catalogued seven of them, the others being easily discoverable by effort. Two of them are on page XLVI of my autobiography; they are anecdotes of singular interest, such as the time a client of mine canceled his return trip because I interrupted him to request an interview; such interviews, unless grudgingly sponsored by the client, are not to be staged in front of him. /1/ I know of the other seven from hearsay.

The Celestial Kingdom



The second conjecture, the one less polemical than the first, holds that the history of the cosmos is a mere complication of dreams, that the division of the dream into waking and dreaming moments is an established fact in our minds, just as the appropriation of another man's image is admitted in dreams to be an aspect of the author. This, we may say, is the accepted state of the matter. However, there is another kind of discrepancy, which we must combat. We say that the history of the cosmos is an "accepted state," but what does that mean? Does it mean that everything that is said about it is true, that all that is felt about it is actually seen? It surely doesn't mean that when one of us speaks of the "fallen serpent" or of the "dragon" one feels anything like the complete and complete reversal of one feels upon discovering the actual reality of those words. We would say that when we dream of Alice we feel like Alice, but we also dream of Colin and of a horse with four legs. Such is the case with everything, but philosophy means fighting over what happens when the night falls. Experience teaches us that, when night falls, everything changes.2

It is certain that the philosophers of olden times dreamed with their eyes;3 now, however, as it is probable that dreams also were used by man in an intellectual way, it is also certain that some trace of this use may be seen in the doctrines of Zeno. Its name, it is lawful we confess, a portentous-but-irrefutable imposition upon the primal dream; but, amid these primordial ruins, something something was dreamt, something which might well be called present time. In Buddhism present time is called Rinpoche; in Buddhism it is denoted the present moment; in Buddhism it is the sequence of roots, which in the Buddhist scriptures are called the zenith to the twelfth, and the rhythm of the years; among the Persians it is represented by the bull and in the Hebrews by the wheel; in all three it is represented by the figure of a serpent. Present time is the order of the universe; in all languages it is the note of a bell; in all languages it is the rhythm of the earth; in all
====================
Dialog and it was over. Quentin had sealed the fate of Fillory, but he didn’t have to feel guilty about it. It wasn’t his fault that Ember and Umber had killed their own family, or that the gods were shirking their divine duty and personal responsibility and marching us right into their service. It was our fault that Ember and Umber had killed them. It was our job.

			The next morning Quentin awoke to find that his chest and abdomen had been inflated, and that his stomach had expanded, nearly filling him full-grown. He was back inside a balloon and he’d forgotten to take off, so now he was sitting on top like a little kid.

			After an inextricable five minutes his insides were a natural marble. He looked like a little kid again.

			He wasn’t stupid. His parents had been smart enough to realize that bank accounts and gold weren’t going to save their son, and they were up to something. Maybe it was revenge, maybe it was retribution, but he felt some sign that they’d found a way—maybe on Fillory, anyway—that his death would not only be satisfying, it would be true retribution. And it was funny, because it was exactly the sort of humor that you didn’t see a lot in the news.

			Quentin had never seen a news story with a bad reporter attached to it. The lead was spectacular, shot through with color: a sixteen-year-old boy from Rhode Island had, for whatever reason, been selected by the local paper to give a talk at the commencement ceremony of a prestigious suburban school. The kid had turned in his acceptance speech, thanked his lucky stars he’d gotten it, and was off, shooting upward and upward and upward of himself, towards the sky, like a bullet through butter.

			The sky had been named after the student union at Cambridge, the ever-omniscient Heywood, and the first thing you noticed about it was that it was named after a student. It wasn’t quite the sight you would have thought, a grand, opulent union college graduation, and the addition of Cambridgeopolis to the boroughs would have been unintentional, but the effect was the same. The new college was named in honor of a student.

			The name
====================
Dialog, both of them, for there was no way back but up.

			“Give me a couple of months and we’ll talk about that,” Eliot said.

			—

			Quentin thought about throwing his lot in with the good fight, but he’d rather be a long way from Fillory from the 1950s. Back then he’d imagine himself a junior marshal, guide and crew, showered and fed and watered and pressed the flanks, and got through his winters without much of a break. He could still remember when he was younger, sitting on the wet, puckered, reddening, rotted-out wheel of his grandfather’s old flat-screen TV, picturing his glorious future. Now he balefully hoped he didn’t look back.

			He found he wasn’t alone in his hope. The ranks of the stout and the tall began moving in. The Huragok marched in solid columns, the tall on each side, forming a solid ring, the middle manning the parapets. The Huragok Himself marched in behind them, in company with the Great Old Ones, the Great Old Ones standing aside as though he didn’t personally know disaster was on the way.

			The Great Old Ones rose to their feet. They were enormous, or at least walled up like sea ancles. They wore the same great gray armor as the Guardians, or at any rate the Guardians had, black and scarlet and bright-gold. Their heads were the same size as Quentin’s, but instead of a sunburst they had a blood-red heart.

			“Avalanche,” Quentin said, “first time you’ve seen me.”

			“I expect.” The Great Old One raised his hands in surrender. “We used to be friends, I'm sure. I figure I must be related.”

			Plum thought about that for a minute. Sure, she’d probably know him her whole life, but did he know she was there? It sounded like a dare she could take.

			“I’ve been here for over a century,” Quentin said.

			“And a very long time
====================
Dialog. The book did not return her call.

			An interminable, hallucinatory phone call later, they finally answered the door. It was Fogg, the cashier at the Magic Horse.

			He sounded like he was all smiles. Plum’s world finally slowed to a crawl. She felt vaguely ashamed that she’d waited this long. She apologized profusely, with effort, for her abruptness. Fogg listened to her quietly but ruefully.

			“I am sorry,” she said. “About the mirror. Did you do it on purpose? I mean, the mirror is right there, it was just a question of mounting it. Did you not want to do it in person? I mean, it’s so perfect. I mean, you’re so high!”

			“I had some ideas,” he said. “Hadn’t you noticed? The writing is a little Raggedy Bill-y, not in the usual Pat's sense—I like to think of it as a homage to Pat Metheny. But it is a riposte to realism, though I don’t know why we should perceive it that way. It is the riposte, not the imitation. If you like, I can give you my whole elaborate reasoning.”

			Now he seemed even more mad than before he opened the case. Inside he pulled out a small brass dial, the kind that a magician would put on an old violin and play slowly—for the notes. It was suspended in air in front of him, like a tuning fork in a symphony. He touched the dial twice, once with his index finger and once with his second finger, and then played the first nine beats of the first movement of a symphony.

			Plum couldn’t hear him, but she could feel the vibrations trembling the dial. The dialbeats returned two notes, then stopped.

			“Quentin,” Plum said, standing up. “The mirror is right here.”

			“I told you.”

			He pointed outside. Outside the window looked down at the courtyard, which was still half dark. “If you ever want to go back, you
====================
Dialog’s not a five-hundred-thousand-acre wasteland: it’s a single-track, rail-roaded-down-highway suburban sprawl. Part of what makes it so interesting is that there’s really not that much in the way of landmarks to guide you. There’s no guardhouse, no sign of an airport, and the closest thing to a public transportation system you’ll ever find is the infamous Foothill Subway, which branches off into the Silver Line, which branches off into the Foothill Freeway. Or the Foothill Aqueduct, which also branches off into the Foothill Aqueduct.

			But even that takes you out of your own little bubble of mediocrity. In Fillory, everybody is an admiral, everybody. Everybody. Everybody. Except for—wait for it—Everybody.

			But it turns out that everyone is Niccolò. Everybody.

			“What is it,” Eliot said, “about us that you’d been looking for so dreadfully much? I mean, I did get the impression from your conversation with Mr. Plover that you didn’t particularly want to go to Fillory after that long, dreadfully boring first night out at the tavern?”

			“I looked for places to live. I looked for places of business interest. I didn’t find them. I didn’t even look in the refrigerator.”

			“You didn’t? Well, don’t tell me you didn’t reap what you sowed.”

			Nicole shook his head.

			“I didn’t look in the refrigerator. I didn’t look at the drawers. That’s all I did. I didn’t do a damn thing.”

			“So you spent your vacation day looking for a way out.”

			“I figured I would at least be able to protest that I wasn’t being used for any purpose other than protest,” Eliot said. “And I figured I would do it somewhere I belonged.”

			“You didn’t.” Plum

Dialog.”

			A note in Fogg’s journal said he’d found his new lost book. Lucy went to the door.

			“What do you think this means?” Quentin said.

			“I don’t know,” she said. “Prudence said it could mean a whole lot of things.”

			“It’s possible—I just don’t know what it’s supposed to mean.”

			“I wasn’t going to say.”

			“I like this series better than the previous ones. Up to a point. Up to point.”

			“Ooooh,” Poppy said. “I love that line. Point of view.”

			“Hang on, I’m talking to Alice,” Lucy said. “Point of view.”

			“Point of view of Alice,” Poppy said. “Point of view of her, of course. But point of view of—of whatever.”

			“It’s a point of view,” Julia said. “Which is exactly why I didn’t say it.”

			“Point of view of Alice,” Julia said. “Point of view of Buck’s head.”

			Aah! thought Poppy. Poppy had meant to say Poppy’s point of view, but her brain couldn’t parse the double entendre right.

			“Point of view of Buck,” she said. “But apart from that it was just us. You, Quentin. I was just a book. Poppy was your copy of the Second Self, yeah?”

			“Yes,” Quentin said. “And your book.”

			“Your copy.”

			Quentin couldn’t even tell if it was a person or a book.

			“Your copy,” he said. “Your book. What kind of a copy?”

The Ganges has repelled war and famine,

It subdues the fierce bull and the wild lion,

It cures leprosy, it enriches the blind,

It is the secret fountain of Achilles,

Dialog, and a word spoken by a Jew who had seen a dove and the Dragon, and had thought: The word means "dove" and the second adjective means "of divine origin." An echo of this word, "dove" and "of divine origin" is heard in the sacred books of India and of the Iberian Peninsula. The Jew, the Christian, the Calvinist theologian have invoked them too in their writings; they echo the same eternity, which the philosophers do not comprehend. . . I understand that the word is of three sounds: (a) the third tone of the soprano, (b) the seventh note of the alto. The first note of the soprano is the same as that of the word "dove," but in the Iberian the second note is the note of the Christian and in the Slavonic it is the note of the word "angel." The word "dove" means "winged one," but in the Iberian it means "winged one that hears" (Miro, Historia de las Américas, section vi).]

====================
DialogThat night at the pub, she’d fallen asleep in the same chair Quentin had used to break her mother’s will, and as far as she knew she had died. She woke up in a chilly hospital bed, surrounded by rows and rows of black, open wounds. Her neck was fucked so many times that her cervical vertebra developed even more, and her ribs were through the wood of the cavity where her pelvis used to be. Her pelvis was snapping shut like the neck of a shark. Her rib cage was ripping apart. Her pelvis was ripping off like a roast chicken. Her legs were ripped off like a girl with a lucky number 40 had just seen and/or touched the life energy field surrounding a butterfly. Her backside was dancing in space. Her soul was seething with life. She was Janet, she of the big dreams, leggy and shivering at the prospect of dying at the feet of Fillory.

			Quentin was in heaven at that moment, and he didn’t sleep that night. He tried to remember what it was like to be human, but the memories were black and white. When he got up the next day, he noticed that his wounds were getting better. They would have been gone within a week, maybe in an hour. But he didn’t feel very human anymore.

			He was still processing all the news, in one day, and even he couldn’t remember everything that was happening. Some of it was very disturbing. Quentin had a crush on Alice, but he wasn’t sure if he wanted to be with her or not. Together they were better off apart. He was pretty sure Alice wanted to be with him, but he didn’t feel like asking her. He wanted to be with Alice already.

			He was still trying to piece all this together after a spell from the Another Lands that took him straight to Fillory put him back on Earth, and he was still trying to figure out how he got here. Everything he’d learned while stuck in Fillory was completely lost on the humans of Fillory. There was no Other, only a kind of abstract, mythical Other, a world of their making.

			Now that he was back on Earth he could at least put his memories back together. He was remembering things like he’d never remembered before, the things
====================
Dialog, though he knew it by heart.

He’d meant to leave the next day, but his body had insisted it stay, and so he stayed and worked in the mirror while the others went over the plan again, again, again, and again. Quentin could have stayed home and cooked, but he knew Essenza preferred working for the mirror anyway, and he always thought of it as a small price to pay for having a really interesting life. Especially when you were the last of the Order to go through the ritual in your class. He appreciated the solitude. It went a long way with her. When he wasn’t working hewas playing chess, with all the trumps and suits and balances still on the table, and that was a lot of pressure to under- handle. He felt the mirror under his heavy eyes like a breath of poisonous gas. When he won an especially ponderous game, he wondered if she ever got enough pleasure out of it.

			At some point she lost the last of her nerve and he won the game, too. Beautifully.

			The next morning Quentin awoke to the sight of a big fat pile of mail on the floor in front of his face. He had completely lost his mind.

			He opened it and unfolded what was left of its paper inside. Stuff from the fourth world, he thought. Here it is, folks. The Mailman used to mail mail back home. It’s in a special case. There was also the old map, with the comet on it, and the letterhead, and a lot of other junk.

			Well, junk wasn’t the issue now. The point of all this was to clear his mind. He had a few ideas, a few commands he was trying to fulfill, but they were things on a quest to which he was completely lost. Now he knew he had to settle for second best. He was going to fix that which was broken, and then some thing.

			He sat down at the worktable and stared at it for a few minutes, unable to take his eyes off of it, until he got it. His mind was a steady stream of gears—accomplished something, probably, thought a bit too fast, plan in ruins. He pulled up a chair, crossed his arms, and traced in the margins of the margins of the
====================
Dialog, the language of the dead. I couldn’t go out, and I didn’t go to the movies. I didn’t go to school. It was like a spell was put on me. I was so scared of going out. I would sneak a look behind me at the other rooms, but I always felt weird coming up on them. And I would stare at the wall in the master bathroom for ten minutes and then go back through the door I had just been trying to reach when they sent me.

			I don’t know if you realize this, but I was losing the battle of wills. It was like my internal clock was going off at this precise location—I felt it ticking down in tempo, on a minute by minute basis. I could see it getting louder and bigger, even in the distance, and I could hear the gears turning in the frog. I could feel my position getting desperate. I could feel myself slipping through the red line they had painted across the white floor in white—that would be the sign they drew if they won. I could hear myself sobbing as I did that. I could feel myself tearing out of my body. I could feel myself bleeding open like a shelled out corkscrew. I couldn’t hold it in anymore—it was coming apart at the seams. I could feel myself already leaking blood. I was about to pass out from the sheer relief and love and anger and strength it was relieving me of everything else. I couldn’t take it any more.

			I didn’t. At that moment everything changed. I knew that if they let me go I was going to. I didn’t want to go anymore. I was so close. I hadn’t made a mess of things yet.

			As I write that the frog has passed away I can still feel the spell breaking. It was over for me. I hear the snapping of the necklamps down at the black deck. I hear Martin say something, and nothing happens.

			I pick up the book. It’s useless. It’s already been written.

			It has been three years. I sit down at the coffee table in the corner and watch television. I watch television for the first time. I watch television with my mother once, and then only because my mother was

Dialog’s had a good go,” Quentin said. “Not so good.”

			“Don’t worry about it. You’re going to be fine.”

			Plum was right, of course. She was right about the books. But Quentin had never been able to get his hands on them. He’d been pretty sure he had a good idea who owned what, where the black market money was, how the rest of the operation worked. He was going to need those books if he was going to help.

			“But—” Eliot stammered. His voice had dropped to a whisper. “But what now? When are we supposed to start? How are we going to get this done?”

			“I don’t know yet. First we have to find out what the hell is going on.”

			“Right, but if you can’t tell us by Friday then I guess I’ll have to wait and see, by your estimation,” Quentin said.

			“I see what you are saying,” Plum said. “Then maybe after we find out,” she added, a touch grudgingly, “we should just find out.”

			That seemed a little harsh, but Quentin didn’t really have any other options. The world was getting out of hand, and he was the only person who had the right combination of skills and talents to turn it around. He was ready for the world of practice, the world of work. He was ready for anything.

			He was ready for whatever Alice was waiting for him at the end of all this, too.

			“You are so hungry,” she said. “You have so much better things to do than look at me that way.”

			She shrunk back down, and the two queens stood together, just the two of them, staring down at the grass. Quentin felt like he was carrying a cannonball up into the stratosphere.

			“No,” Alice said. “It’s not the other queens. You wouldn’t know it from our interactions, but they really do want us
====================
Dialog, the most basic form of language. It consists of a series of letters, each of which determines a noun or verb, though in the figures for the verbs the reader is provided with a visual image of the noun or verb. The most common of these visual images is the halo, a point of light in a crowded room. Others are the noose, a sheet of writing that does not list any facts or discuss subjects, but is instead continuously on its way, a mantra or prayer. Others are the card, a book page so neatly laid out that it seems laid out by a single hand. Others are the chair, a table with a surface that is so perfectly smooth that any deviation is undetectable. Others are magic numbers that cannot be explained by verbal means; they are the invariable. Others are the tableau. Others are what Montaigne called "forms," the relations of objects in relation to one another. There are twenty-five common cards in the Jug, in which the elements spring from nine possible packs. (In the chess set there are also bishops and knights.) Each pack has it own twenty-five cards, which it multiplies or subtracts according to the instructions on it, until—at the end of the game)—"After nineteen cards, there is a checker card, which is equal to a zero, and so on to the last checker card which is a one: thirteen, and so on to the hundredth checker card which is a four: and so on to the thousandth checker card which is a third: and so on to the next hundredth card which is a two: and so on to the last card which is a zero: sixteen, and so on to the corner card which is a zero: and so on to the door: and finally, after nineteen doors, to the one at the far end of the room."

"Amazing," I said. "I never thought of it that way."

"You do?"

"Almost. I don't know how to stop myself."

Dialog.My memory is faulty: it can be restored at any time. However, I believe that my manuscript documents—words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, images, sounds, tastes, smells, tactile impressions—are a reliable guide to the future. I should like to restore them to you, so that you too may have your last chapter.

"Beginning in Rome, in the first century A.D., every nation began to write. In the library of Pompey there is a folio written in a dialect of Lombard, which tells the history of the republic. In the second century, a dialect of Hebraism was created. The first inhabitants were soldiers and in the Euphrates. From this region, from Lombardy, were sent the first translations of the Apocalypse and of the Creed. In the fourth century, the sect which teaches that the Trinity exists in two persons was created. Then, too, there was a republic based on the military. In the fifth, the sect which maintains that the elements were originally water and air. This pretended to be orthodox, but it was soon destroyed by a schism. In the sixth, the sect which denies that the universe is three days, three nights and one day. This also was destroyed, though not without a battle. In the eighth, the one which denies that the world began with a faith which it lasted until the last moment. This also was destroyed, though not without a battle. In the twelfth, the one which denies that the world began with a faith which it lasted until the last moment. This also was not destroyed. Perhaps the most infamous of all is that of the ineffable, the one which does not deserve to be written at all. This sect claims authorship of everything, and no author can be found. It is absurd, I know, but not infact more absurd than the others. Therefore, I write it as one man, with no possible justification or error. I do not believe in middle ages or in the abyss. I write it as a man of the nineteenth century, who saw the universe, understood it, wrote about it and left an imprint on it."

He continued:

"Ten years ago one of my followers told me that the world was about to end. I believed him, for there had been a general confession of faith in the forest of Alexandria, in the imminent end which was foretold in the Koran and in the evangelists.

====================
Dialogos (The Pilgrim's Progress, IV).

Even today, no one denies that there are men and women who strive for the perfectibility of their acts, who are always searching for venality, magic, licentiousness. This malignant sect, the Tetragrammaton, is singled out (I Kings Isaac, XXXVI) as the secret name of a man, whose work is written upon the mountains and whose worshipers forget that they are animals, not men. . . The Gnostics attribute to him the discipline of speculative theology; this supposed man of letters, of Aachen, of Rhineland, of Egypt, pays no attention to this man's instructions. He obtains his heavenly office (I Kings, XCVI); he officiates there (xCVI). He teaches (XCVII); he is not surprised that after three centuries (xCVIII) his pupils shall not remember what they have learned (xCVIV). From these three instances we may judge from others the mental maturity of the infidel. The Jew, in order to perfect his diatribe (xCVVIII), makes use of figurative diction; the Christian retorts with his eyes, with moderate vehemence, with a correcture (xCIX). The troglodyte, in order to refute these fallables, feigns fatigue, with moderate vehemence, with a correcture (xCXX). The Christian, in order to refute these fallables (which he very nearly does!), feigns affliction, with moderate deference. The Jew, in order to perfect his diatribe, makes use of simile and with a straight face makes the retort ad hominem. The troglodyte, in order to correct his predecessors, feigns affliction, with mild deference. The Christian, in order to correct his predecessors, feigns affliction, with moderate deference.

Let us see if we have refuted their diatribes (xCXXI, 2, 3).

They begin by attacking the 1 Peter, which reads: "We believe in one God, and in a High, a sustaining God, Who is YHWH, blessed of His tender age, Who sends rain, and the frankincense tree, and the book that in it is written that all things are possible to him that believes in Him" (II Tim. I
====================
Dialogs should have a rhetorical purpose, a point of departure from which all subsequent rhetorical devices can be derived. They should not be ornamental or decorative (though they often are) but rhetorical. They should not engage the intellect in a constructive way, but as an adjective or a verb should be enigmatic. They should not resort to adverbial language, but are more likely to be applied to ideas, events, or processes. They should be unambiguous; insipid or noncommittal dialects are those which exhibit this quality.

In the pages of Léon Bloy, who was also a Léon, this quality was satirized, but it is clear that he believed it to be fundamental. He wrote: "Dialectic is the art of finding objects, finding meanings, in the relations of an almost indecipherable chaos. It is the literacy of the unconscious, the secret genesis of everything. A fool deludes himself with dialectic; a man of science with experience."

This may be taken literally: we speak of having become mystified; we speak of an incomprehensible series of interminable words; we speak of the secret genesis of the universe. But it is also possible that the character of mystic who speaks of an incomprehensible series of interminable words is a superficial one. In any case, the fact that the work was written by one Bloy (and, as we have seen, by one Turgenev) and that the phrases found in it date to the years immediately preceding and immediately following the death of the Primoryelevich -- a similarity which greatly strengthened our belief -- weakened the mystic's point of view. Turgenev's dictum that "History is an infinite series of approximations" seems at first sight to concord with his dictum that "History is an infinite series of coincidences." In fact, as far as I know, no one tried to explain the coincidences of 1914-1917. The only eminent authority we know of who has attempted to do so is Franz Daniken, who flourished in the thirteenth century; Daniken's book does not exist any more. (Daniken was in the habit of quoting from the No-Chapters into the Past whenever he traveled a considerable distance; the translators of the NEPTOT series decided to keep his notes.)

It is known that in the ethnographies of Vladimir Levinaos (writing about the years

			“I like that about this place,” Eliot said. “I like the blankness. You know?”

			“I do.”

			They spent an hour and a half walking the halls, waiting for the perfect moment. It was just them and the ceiling, down to the barest of staples. The view was OK, just enough of a picture to suggest that it was coming up with a unified front right now, like it was taking a wild guess at who it was going to pitch its second presidential debate to. Janet was taking long, cautious, cautiouser steps back toward the door, taking careful aim not to step on anything.

			“You know, I like this more here,” Eliot said. “I’m less likely!”

			“You’re right.”

			The mood in the conference room was tense but hopeful. Even without Janet, Poppy was having an effect. She was cradling a black lump of black stone in her hands, the tip of her tongue just scraping the white sandy border of what looked like a tsunami.

			“I think I’m going to have to talk you out of it,” she said. “Look, I know it’s risky, but this is what democracy looks like.” She pressed a button on the wall, on the far end, that produced a sliding door that she swung wide to let them outside. “It’s who we are.”

			There was a coolness to them both that defied explanation. They were two master thieves who genuinely wanted each other. And yet. And yet. Quentin had longed to see them in years to come, year in tiny, unrecognized letters etched on the walls of the Clock Bar, and months on the run as a teen-ager with no specific future in mind but a career in law enforcement, a nascent fantasy novel, and a queer family he didn’t know. They were two men who saw each other every day in the empty back

Dialog to the god, "The rain is coming." The god answers, "You are a liar, you say the rain is coming, but the hail is not." The god to the hailstor, "The water has turned to water." The hailstor to the water, "You are a liar, you say the water turns to water, but the men you are addressing are not men."

Dionysius the Areopagite resumes, "For the art of divination one need but consult one of the artists of the antique and farthing shops; for the interesting art of metempsychosis another."

"The second art," writes Böhme, "is the illegal art: the kind of art that serves only to enliven, to diffuse, the already diffuse world. Metempsychosis is such a art. The infamous city of le brassofay (vintage 1884) is another name for the subconscious Self, which lies some one of the many stars in the darkness. . . The le brassofay Self is a secret and beautiful one: it is infinite, transparent, delicate, beginning at the photographic center and expanding to the surface, then receding again, then expanding again, until it is as thick as the sky over Leibniz's room. This Self is not conscious, but it is perfect in every way, because its qualities are infinite: it is both eternal and timeless."

"In general," I read, "the le brassofay Self is not expressed by traditional artists." Certainly not by those who have traced its roots in Tlön and who have compared it with Kafka's Tlön without the latter's name. For these very reasons I thought it worthy of notice in the thesis of my studio, in order to help clarify it, a symbolic analysis which will serve to solve the riddle of my work.

In order to begin with, let us consider one characteristic of Kafka's Self. It is a bit indefinite, though not in the sense of being powerless: it is capable of very complex concepts, beginning with the simplest terms, as in "The letters n and p are identical" (mayo), and it can be more complex, as in "The book n is the book pen n" (pink), or very long and rigid ones like the "discoveries" of Leibniz, which are concepts of

Dialog’s still in the air, and it’s getting harder and harder to tell if it’s moving forward or stopping. He’ll try to figure out what to do about that when he gets back. The spell must have been pretty stupid strong for a while, and he’d forgotten a lot of things when it went off. He’d forgotten the fundamental constituents, the exact arrangements of protons and neutrons, and also a bunch of stuff about magnetic orientation and the like. He remembered them in great detail, but he hadn’t quite PGP them yet.

			He had forgotten a bunch of stuff as well, and now he did. Like what the hell was that spell for.

			Quentin had no idea what it was supposed to do, and even less that he would even let himself use magic again. It had robbed him of so much, and even more he just felt like he was dying a slow and painful death myself. He opened his eyes and rubbed his eyes once, then twice, then three times, before putting his head in his hands and wrapping his arms about his chest. He groaned and sank back down against the pillow.

			It had been a long night. He would get some sleep, maybe he could even fall asleep for a bit. He didn’t need to be working.

			He had to get back to the library, but first he had to change into his work clothes. It was a long way from the simple but very relaxing act that had been his first task as teacher, so far as he knew, so he’d better keep going and keeping moving. Like a good mage running, hewed from the stars, hewed from the staff of Jove. He was weaving a legacy.

			Speaking of which he was seeing if he could start weaving a legacy too.

			Jane Chatwin was dead, and then he was sure of his place in the world, but he had left her belongings—his desk, his chair, his books, his things. He hadn’t needed to ask her first. What he needed now was a legacy, and that was what this was all about. Workloads, little legacies, was what it was for.

====================
DialogThe mind of man is a series of relations; the mind of an infinite number of men is a series of absolutes. Cartaphoreau, in the sixteenth chapter of his book enumerates them:—

"The mind is a collection of perceptions; each perceived fact is a bridge over others which connect it with the next perception. The mind is not a series of mere ratios, however imaginary they may be; each ratio contributes to the overall grandeur. The ratio of the carton of cigarettes to the last perception, the ratio of the candle to the odorous smoke, is not arbitrary, though each of them is. It is a structure of the sublime, a cornerstone of the humble, a symbol of the vast, a secret formula of the gods. The mind is the art of categorizing and of knowing what to investigate next. It is the alchemical formula, it is the Greek archangelsandre, it is the ancient tradition that it was Jehu who killed Mils van Gerlich, it is the learned Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, it is the psalm which has the Lord Jesus Christ over it as its first adoration. The mind is the sea, it is the stars, it is time, it is the dissection of the soul, it is evil, it is good, it is wisdom. It is any concatenation of qualities which a philosopher will unite in the adjective concept. . . Cultivate a certain mental disposition, undergo some trial, and behold what diligence and hardihood can do for you. Be a madman, be sane, be a cynic, and one will almost certainly find in them a clue to a kind of terrible happiness. A happiness which is a tacit comfort, a tacit authorization, for man to feel nothing whatever whatever whatever. A kind of apotheosis, perhaps, in the error. . . Beneath all the vain nonsense of life there is a charm which every man is capable of creating. In the labyrinths of Zen or in the fantastic courts of Grimm, there is a principle which every man has at his disposal. In Zen the master premeditates the route taken him and then reveals to his students the labyrinth and the routes along which they must traverse in order to reach the destination. In Grimm's fairy tales there are heroes who persevere in the void, in the darkness, where they are suddenly revived by the sound of distant streams or by the sight of gem

It had shown up in his pockets, neatly lined up on the table, along with a tasseled tiara and a bunch of empty wineglasses. She’d brought them too. She must have felt like celebrating, Eliot thought, maybe she’d been right all along.

====================
Dialog)

The other day I was having a glass of Pinot Gris mercera in the presence of some friends: a glass of such a vintage is of course mandatory by tradition. (The appellation means "black-headed" and "aggressive"; it is, in fact, of ancient origin, having for its distinguishing mark, in the latent state of the wine, the form of a ferocious beast.) The reference was obvious; the wine was excellent, without a shadow of a doubt, but the conversation was porous, the style formal. My task was to discover the cause of this paucity of interest. Was it that the friend's life was very limited, that he could not complete all nights of the week, or that the one evening a part of the year was not enough? I reasoned that if my intellect is so limited, so is the rest of my being, since no one's mind is. At that moment I understood myself. I understood that an entire life completes one single mental state, a single mental state so complex that it deserves its own name; I also knew that this unique mental state ― my present present being ― is identical with nothing more or less. I felt that the vague, living, immaterial substance of the cobwebs is, in fact, nothing less than the entirety of the universe, which is eternal and endless. I felt that the world is not what is happening on the other side of a glass, behind it, but rather what is happening here, on my side. I knew that this world is not hostile, not an inverted and contradictory mirror, but rather the whole of the universe, the sum of its parts. I understood that the gradual transmigration of the races would complete my ideal state. I felt that this great intellectual accomplishment was an integral part of my very redemption. . .

These feelings, these modifications, were the product of almost a whole lifetime. They are, however, insufficient to produce the theory I shall attempt to sketch. I shall try to relate the process of thinking in these pages, not as a docen of gradual evolution, but as a vast chain of one and the same events. A process which I believe I can complete, if by doing so I may permit myself to be distracted from the rectitude of the present.

Before proceeding, it is necessary to sketch the basic structure of my theory. The following paragraphs are characterised by their numerical order.

She’d never seen more than one book in her life. She took it out, and it felt like she’d been thrown ten feet outwardly, but everything was just a little bit easier. She walked around the corner into the library, which had shrunken doors, and which opened out onto the grass. She felt small and insignificant. Maybe it was the caffeine, but everything was a little easier.

			It had been a week since they’d set foot in the library. Eliot had gone off on his own to fight in the War of the Serpent, and Madeline had come back from London in a small hurry-up stallion—ramheaded into the ranks of the elders, she’d lost her riders, and they’d lost her, and the stallion had run away, and it had been pretty much that. She refused to give up on those words, or those hopes, and she was the only one of them who could.

			“I’m glad I was born when I was,” Quentin said. “Because otherwise you’d be dead already.”

Alpharetta, the city. In the nineteenth centenary of its foundation a sort of universal affection for this little corner of the earth had appeared in the seminal hygienists of Todesdal. This affection, it was plausible, had something to do with the friendly climate, the ample and well-appointed countryside, the admirable architecture, the divinely preserved antique fountains, the almost infinite bounty of the best libations (from every tongue) and the almost infinite variety of the seasons: it was plausible also, assuredly, because it was true. In 1898, a few days before the foundation of the city, a bomb had devastated the spacious rue de Toulon in the southern suburb of Buch. The complex chronological and psychological circumstances of the catastrophe were impossible to untangle. It is no exaggeration to say that the remnants of the tragedy are still grossly misunderstood.

The Alpharettanic hymns that restored faith returned to the lips of their listeners the most beautiful phrases from the frescoes: God is near, God is in the infernal chambers, God is in the forbidden republic, God is under the tower, God is up above, God is within the library, God is working evil, God is tenanted by the filthy, God is full of sleep, God is hot on the back of Beatrice, God loves to be choked, God loves to be smeared, God loves to be seen, God loves to be wiped away).

Symposium



A word on the synonyms: one does not need a contemporary of Rubens to note that the verb symposis means to tear, to tear away, to throw down, to break down, to break up, to cast down, to split, to split up, to split in two, to split in two, to split in two, three, four, five, six, for example. This root is attested in the Iliad, in the famous section on the Tetragrammaton, in the biblical tabernacle, in the titles of synergetic and neurotic hospitals, in the nom. suffragans of Milan and in that of Rubens. In the eleventh century, Schlieren recounted the history of the root in her study of the pet theories of Nietzsche.

In the thirteenth century, the idiom symposized was appearing in the newspapers and on the pages of medical and philosophical journals; in the sixteenth century, the theory was perfected. Franz Boas, in order to elucidate the rudiments of unity and of variation in the structure of an triangle, made the following experiments: he arranged the three points P, Q and R in such a way that if he had examined them from above, he should have seen them as three equal horizontal stripes running parallel to one another. When he examined the same points the same way from below, he would have seen them as four equal horizontal stripes running parallel to each other. The solution was obvious: each of the horizontal stripes, corresponding to a direction, was formed by joining the corresponding horizontal stripes in the next direction. Thus, if the four vertices are P,Q,R, the tetrahedron has four equal horizontal stripes P,Q,T, representing four directions, representing four directions. In other words, the triangle has three sides and three pentagons, or three pent

Dialog With The Wall In The Book

The wall at the end of the world is the most beautiful thing in the world. It is a hexagon of infinite areas, of which the upper half is almost invisible and the lower half the rest of the wall. The upper half is made up of three walls joined by means of a roof, two of hard stone and the third of flowing water. The roofs and the water are there because that is where the three Masters are, in the ceiling, in the floor and in the wall. There is a great brackish stream on the other side, so that if you were to throw a stone across it it would just hit the other stone. The other two Masters, Beauty and Hunger, are further back on the dial, in the bedrock. There is a great square room to the right of the roof, floor and wall, bare except for a pegboard, with a bed for Hobbes and a desk. Above that is a hexagon of shattered rock, with a sign saying "The Leaping Men" and a wolf. Above that is a hexagon of vertical columns of fire, with a sign saying "The Horizontal Column of Fire." Above that is a hexagon of balconies pierced by pits in the ground, with a javelin and a dead dog. Above that is a hexagon of corridors of shattered marble, with a dog. Above that is a balcony of open space pierced by broken tiles. Above that is a balcony of ruin pierced by broken tiles. Above that is a balcony of silence pierced by broken tiles. Above that is a balcony of confusion. There are nine of these. The masterpieces, when they are whole, are so continuous that it is impossible to distinguish one from another. To walk through them is to be nine persons one with another. (Hammersley speaks of a "neighboring but profound magic," but if that is the case I do not know what other word I should use.") Nine persons one with another is closer to our normal number of neighbors than ninety-nine is to that of the leper. Nine persons one with another is closer to our normal number of neighbors than nine is to that of the Tiger. Nine persons one with another is closer to our normal number of neighbors than nine is to that of the Whore of Babylon.

Dialog’s not the tabula rasa,” Plum said. “It’s more like a tapas.”

			“What’s a tapas?” Josh said. “What’s not my cup of tea?”

			“Okay, okay. You got it. So a tapas is a bunch of ingredients smooshed together in a pot, put through a straw and then left to sit around for a while neglected, seldom used, so they can't do anything useful with them. A tapas is a tapas,” Eliot said, though he seemed more comfortable with the more precise definition. “And a hell of a lot less appetizing.”

			“Six.”

			“Six is the magic number. You want to do it right?”

			“Right. I think I’m getting there.”

			When they started coming up with their ideas for the competition—which were, needless to say, very much creative projects—they’d kept it to themselves. There was a lot of back-channel joking about a seventy-six-type thing, and Eliot had warmly accepted the premise. But the hard part had been getting there. They’d had to break the loop, and they’d had to break the ice, and they’d had to break the camel’s back.

			“Have you guys seen the prints yet?” Josh said. “Theylsien’s Graves.”

			“We scanned it once,” Janet said. “And we couldn’t. It kept on veering back into Fillory. It never did go back again.”

			“What? Wait.” Eliot was beginning to feel a little sorry for them. They’d known all along that it was coming, they just hadn’t realized they were going to have anon-time to mock it. Eliot had seen the prints, he knew what thehip was, but there was always that other one.


====================
DialogThat night, Kate made dinner for them at the house. The menu was simple: it was going to be a long, hard hard boar chop, with braised short ribs, braised shoulder of braised short rib, and a side of braised short rib with applewood-smoked pecorino rice. They ordered separately, without looking at the menu, just at the mane and the features of the woman behind the counter.

			She smiled at the thought that Quentin might recognize her, and he did. She was slim and petite, like a piece of wood carved from a jaguar long ago. She was dressed in a pale blue poncho, long underwear that were too short, and sandals. When he saw her hands, he thought of how they had been so carefully cleaned and de-sanded for the trip. It was like she were preparing something very special for him.

			They sat on the floor in a ring, halfway down, Quentin on one end and Plum on the other. A patch of ground had been designated as the perimeter; a few dry leaves had been planted there, along with a couple of rock steps leading down. The moon had been pointed down, in case anyone was distracted by its shining there on the other side.

			As they ate, nothing moved in the house. Apparently the spell had been cast correctly, or at least properly unnoticed. Janet hadn’t come home since morning. Quentin hadn’t heard from her either.

			Plum lay down on the floor and snuggled up into Quentin’s lap.

			“I don’t know,” she said. “I’m just so glad you were here. And I know it seems like a lot of stuff, but it’s kinda scary how quickly time goes. You could have died or everything would have been different.”

			“I would have died,” Quentin said. “But I know how to stop that. I’m a sorceress. I know how to save people.”

			“But you could have died,” she said. “You could have lost everything. Everybody.”

			Quentin laughed, a bitter one, which he kept. He didn’t want to

Dialog’s going to be a lot of fun.”

			“Well, let’s see how many of these things we can get through in one night.”

			Quentin took off his visor, which he’d hidden behind his elbow, then placed it back on.

			“OK.”

			“Let’s do this.”

			He rubbed his face in the grass. It was getting late—it was probably just the heat and the specialness, the post-coital delights, he’d fallen head over heels for anyway—but he had to say something.

			“Dem p���t b’is t’ush.”

			“How are we going to do this?” Plum asked.

			“Simple: we do magic.”

			“So you don’t have to teach me.”

			He stopped walking and examined the grass with a skeptical eye.

			“Ooh, so you’re dating a magical creature then.”

			“Not dating, just mentoring it.”

			“So you’re saying you’re not into dating?”

			“Um. No. I don’t find you very interesting.”

			“Then how are we going to break it?”

			“I don’t know. Magic. De-magic.”

			“De-magic?” Plum studied him mutely. “What are you trying to say by that?”

			He produced a slimy globe from his noracle vest and placed it on the grass.

			“One theory is that the only way to break the cycle is to break the cycle itself.”

			“I don’t get it,” Quentin said. “How do you break an endless cycle of love?”

			“One love,” he said. “One love, mister Quentin. All the love there is.

Dialog, right?”

			“You’re being paranoid,” Eliot said. “I mean, there’s no evidence. But there’s a lot of evidence. Like, really really evidence.”

			“Proof of your existence,” Quentin said. “Of course there’s proof. Always has been. Now does it feel good?”

			Julia nodded.

			“Then maybe it’s time.” She tapped her tongue with a phalanx of hooves. “Four minutes, thirty-seven seconds.”

			She pulled the trigger.

			The bullet didn’t bounce. It lodged in the wood like a sodden dryad. Dread carved Julia’s voice for a long time after it came tumbling down.

			“Stop!” gasped Eliot. “It’s nothing.”

			She did. The wet wood shook. The spell broken could mean the difference between life and death.

			“Julia!” Eliot ran over. “What are you doing here?”

			She’d calmed her, though he wasn’t sure she’d actually let him stay that way long. She’d taken off running, probably to the farthest corner of the universe, and they were now circling the perimeter of her property, flying directly over it. She huffed some more power, and the wood shivered.

			“What is this?” Julia said. “This is weird. What is all this stuff?”

			“It’s all magic,” Julia said, standing up too. “All this stuff you hear about, it’s not real. And the funny thing is, we don’t know why either.”

			“Well,” Quentin said, “it’s not real either. We don’t know each other. We haven’t seen each other for a long time.”

			“But if you do, how are we going to get out of here?”

			“I’m not sure yet.”

			“We’ve never left the first time around.”

			“We’d have to go back.”

			Quentin looked down at his palm, the rough-hewn rafters of a roof suddenly full of stones. He frowned at them sadly. His friends were almost certainly right: the only way out was up.

			“Go on then.” He bit back another impulse, small, quick ones. “If you have to, I’m going to stick my finger up my nose. Okay? Okay?”

			“OK.” She did.

			He planted his hands flat and conceded a tall, narrow, almost impossibly handsome right hook. He hadn’t done it in ten years, but he knew what to do. He looked like a king facing an army. Quentin kissed it and pushed it aside.

			He was almost sorry he hadn’t dated anyone yet. Not until this Quentin had dated, and maybe married—he didn’t his junior year, sorry, sorry—but he had never met anybody yet. He was still sort of nervous, and he still didn’t know if he was a king or a prophet. Eliot was handsome, but he was a bit on the timid side, and he tended to get a bit self-conscious in the company of other guys. And anyway, he’d never been one of them.

			And anyway he was pretty sure he wasn’t a king—yet.

			“I am not a king,” he said, almost defiantly. “I am just saying.”

			“Exactly. In a way we are bringing this country back.”

====================
DialogThe art of the thief. It is an art that he whose ancestors banged down our doors made, not of words, but of symbols. My great-grandfathers had to sell cotton in open fields, to survive. He would hide bare chests from the French soldiers who would shoot at them from a distance, firing artillery shells full of sand, I think, that missed him. At night he would cross empty fields, steps ahead, slowly, motionless, counting on the shadows to tell him the moon was late, and the leaves were turning. Sometimes he would sneak up behind a soldier and stab him in the breast with a knife concealed in the worn cloth of a leaf. Once ― he was caught, and spent, and executed. I know not how it was done ― he had the soldier's knife cut out of his breast, as if with a knife which disfigured another knife, and placed in the soldier's mouth to be poisoned later. Then he could eat alone.

Once the general of the garrison was having a cigar and I was passing by; the general told me he had never seen a more curious man. He told me the story of the felling of the trees; he told me the felling of the trees because his horses could no longer sit up straight and because women who bore children could no longer sit down. He told me the story because trees topple over one another and one can easily be carried over a tree without realigning one's torso. He told me the story because if a tree fell over you, it would be better that way, because it would be as if it had not been borne. Then he turned over a few leaves and laughed heartily.

Then he turned over a few leaves and laughed heartily. Then he told me that all this happened in a single sitting. He sat: one foot on the box, the other on the box. Then he told me that the general had told him a secret: in the complex action of all the orders that govern the general's sitting and standing, there is a single procedure that is not combined with it and therefore does not disturb the others. This procedure is known as the clock-sitting procedure. As a rule, only the most urgent operations are put before the siding-plan; smaller ones, such as the placement of men and guns, are placed under another system. The men sit on hooks made of wood; the guns on wheels secured by tendon or

			“And what kind of a day was it?” he asked.

			“Pretty much the same as about a month ago,” Plum and Plum said.

			“Same as last month,” Quentin said. “Same as a month ago. Last month I thought we were going to win the lottery and decide to quit our jobs and get totally miserable.

			“But we didn’t.” Plum and Plum were silent.

			“I guess that we should probably go back to the drawing board.” Plum picked up a lock of Plum’s hair. “We could always try again.”

			“But what if we do try again?” Eliot said.

			“I don’t know,” Plum said. “We could always let this stand.”

			“We would have to move into Pushkar’s old house,” Plum said. “Grow a new garden. That’s what land agents do. We’re talking a couple of new houses down here.”

			“But what if Pushkar moves again?” Quentin said.

			He had a terrible sneeze.

			“What? No! It’s not--”

			“It’s not--,” Plum said.

			They had to start over. Everything they knew before they killed Pushkar they knew even less about. There was a great deal they didn’t know, and they weren’t sharing it. If anything they were going to make Pushkar even more insane.

			Quentin was brilliant as always. He figured out a way to make a coin out of the dried leaves of a dwarf tree in the [[City of the Long Autumn]] which he struck into quarters and then struck into pieces to make funny weapons.

			He also figured out a spell that turned the dwarf into a giant rat, which he used to make faces. Faces of various sizes and shapes. He made faces like they were the last remaining humanoids on Earth.

			“He’s a cad. Or seventeen. Or sixteen.”

			“Quentin, stop it.” He was right, it was coming back to him. “I’m a cad. Or I think I am, anyway. Please, Julia.”

			“Julia, listen to me. This isn’t how it works. You don’t have to do this. But I want you to change your mind. It’s the rules we need to consider."

			“What rules?”

			“The first is that I have too much time. The second is that I have a lot of it. The third one is that I don’t want it to be what it should be.”

			“The Second Rule of Time Isn’t It?” Eliot pressed a finger on his lips. “Which One’s Your Right Hand, then?”

			“That’s My Left.”

			“Mine,” she confirmed, in a flat tone. Photograph: Phil Lent for the Guardian Lucy’s face turned from one of complete happiness to one of the most unflappable face I’ve ever seen. “Mine and yours,” she went back to her book, “but yours isn’t going to be what it was.”

			“Mine,” Poppy agreed, “but yours isn’t going to be what it was.”

			There was no point, of course, except that order weaned us of the one consistent violation of the other’s rules. Plum pressed the blame between her teeth.

			“I’m so sorry,” she said, “I really am.”

			“It’s not your fault, Julia,” Plum said. “It only works that way because you’re a shitty person.”

			“What, like the asshole jerk who ordered take-out?”

			“Like the other asshole person, like.”
====================
Dialog. The mental role of Sartre in this story is not very important, whatever his reputation or his reasons for having created it. What is significant is that in the course of a thousand and one improvised and repeated words this isolated and almost accidental man, who for one reason or another had to create a world, managed to come up with The Wager and transmute the most simplest of mental activities into one of the most intricate and abstract of operations, into the mental representation of a world. . . The achievement is phenomenal, the technique higher still. I read with interest this account (Trotsky: Dialogo Néstor Loroch, Moscow, 1923), composed by the same man some thirty years later, in whom the atmosphere had been greatly heightened by the turnover of associates. He wrote: "The Wager is a game whose result one way or another one will not get anything out of it. One evening, my left hand started to shake as it tried to perform two or three mental calculations simultaneously. I touched the page without even expecting to feel pleasure: the page shook with my touch and said aloud or whispered what I tried to write."

Probably the most detailed exposition I have come across does not require the almost infinite number of articles by the same author, but I have transcribed here a fragment from a document (N. A. Wasserman: Klostersveshetson, Russland, 1921), written by Lenin some years after the death of his idol. In this document we read (in understandable English): "It is certain that my idol, Ivan Khlyon, who was born in Kherson, learned the writing and the laconic speaking of his own language, but it is also certain that no one could speak fluently orikkin or Turkestanik."

In the first place, it is true that none could: there are the bare statistics. It is also true that it is extremely dangerous to speak the language orikkin orikkin, for the heads of nations never like to be led by the impression that they are a people of warriors, and it is also true that the honorifics orikkin and orikkin do not naturally imply power. One must also mention the infamous Nikita Khrushchev, who, when representing himself before the Politburo, used the pretentious pretension of addressing the Federation in the vernacular of Khanty-Volynsk, when in actual

Dialog. I love the sound of that thing.

			“You know, this whole business of the wardrobe,” Eliot said, “I was wondering if you could point us in that direction.”

			“On occasion,” she said. “But only if you promise not to tell the queen.”

			Eliot nodded, but his face didn’t change.

			“OK.”

			“For a couple of weeks now I’ve been putting together a case. And a host of other stuff.” He showed her a bunch of dresser drawers, and one dresser to hold his books in, lined with cardboard boxes, flattened and boxed the same. “These are my tools, guys. I make everything from here. Here.”

			He showed her one wall, bare except for a single box of markers, a marker pen, a stop arrow, a whisk and a big chase arrow, which were followed by another marker and an imperial markerless, which had an arrow on it.

			“Wow.” She took in the faces of all the people who’d ever walked through that door—the last one is his, by the way. “They’d all say I didn’t care, but I did. I wanted you to have one more chance, and I was going to get another demon. I made myself clear that I was going to kill you now. I swear it.”

			He showed her the skull, the face, the features. Not taken. The dresser drawers were full of trophies and trophies and epaulets and symbols of power. Gold leaf entwined in pearls. Glasses from around the edges. Gold teeth. Gold rings. Gold claws. Gold claws in tiny letters in a purse. Gold on chains. Gold on switches. Gold on pipes. Gold on plates. Gold on bars. Gold on bars on bars. Gold on bars on bars.

Dialogos straining to remain above all petulant. I noted his irritation and lowered my voice.

			“But you did! You did it all!”

			I took a deep breath and stammered, “I suppose I did. Did I? No.”

			“Well, look, I really don’t want to talk about it.”

			“No, I don’t,” he said. “But I will say this: Ember and Umber, as far as I know, never ended up with each other.”

			“Really.” Umber’s just not that into dudes.

			“Well, no, really. They never ended up together. But they did get along. And they were constantly fighting. And it was never going to stop.”

			“Oh, come on,” I said. “He’s not dating anybody. It’s not like he’s a full-time guy-hunter.”

			“Well, no. But then is it with anybody you know of? With your known contacts?” Umber’s not that impressive in a circle. He’s sort of a dick. “With whom you think you’ve got something to do with it? I don’t know. Maybe he just has to do all the talking.”

			“With Ember,” I interjected, “I think we’d better get moving.”

			“I disagree.”

====================
Dialog; that book which was written by two men, one of them a rhetorician; that book which had its chapters devoted to the Athena of Plato and the Labdanus of Tacitus. It was written by Lucullus, a rhetorician, and it is absurd to suppose that the reader of this letter would have been led to doubt that the God of Lucullus and the God of Tacitus were one and the same. It is equally absurd to suppose that the intelligent public had the grace or the intelligence to penetrate the skillful stratagem of the scribes who had the book transliterated six times and then attributed to different translators the different versions. . . The scribes did not care to let the truth escape them. They had to conceal the truth about the binding and the bears, about the covers, about the date, about the purpose and the argument.

The invention of a cipher (which was afterwards assisted by the printing press) had two effects. One, the transfer of power from the mind to matter; the other, the transfer of power from the mind to form. The first effect could be intended for detective or disciplinary purposes; the second (for work which required the transmigration of ideas) for propaganda or indoctrination. The job of the censor was to note such purposes and identify the authors. Cicero, in the Republic, defined a book a posteriori to say whether it was from two masters or whether it was from some one who had one master's book and another's's's word. All books, Drancyy as they are, are dialects; they all say the same thing, which is to say it to some extent. Some saycareplus, otherscareplus; Drancyyy iscareplus, and that is how I shall refer to all my writers.

The point at issue in the present controversy is this: Are there authors who do not say what is put forward as the case, independently of authorship? Are there authors who deliberately try to confuse their arguments with that of their readers? I do not know the answer to this rhetorical question, but I know the present state of the literature. To tolerate authors who take advantage of this deplorable situation is, I think, a situation we cannot afford to ignore.

Let us return to Carrasco. Let us suppose he writes a paragraph on luck; suppose he finds the premonitions of a handsome dowry in the
====================
Dialog, which he had never learned. God! what a world! But there came a moment when he felt that he would rather die than live it. He felt he was going to dry up the whole renowned blue sea, to drown in a single instant the innumerable youthful foaming masses that tottered on the surface and sought no more securely shelter in the trunks of the trees. So he took off his cap and exposed to the sunlight inconceivably beautiful inner eyes, which filled the gloomy recesses of the face with a hypnotic brilliancy.

"This process must not be confused with vision. Vision takes us from one to another; in my case from one moment to another, from the estranging frown of death to the rising vision of a young Juliet to the deepening sense of a languishing grief. The present one lasts less than a second; God willing, it will not last even that long." He looked again at the carcase. Now his mood was not torpid. Now he felt adventurous. "Let us see," he whispered, "whether this death which threatens us is not also a design, a projection of my horrible dream?"

Then he saw a triangle. A triangle in three directions: from the right, from the left and from the north. The north point was EAST, the south POINT NORTH OF TWENTIETH CITY. The city which he had just seen from the balcony was TRUTH, and the north point of the arms OF TWENTIETH CITY.

For the first time Julian thought of this revelation with something less than an exalted mental image. He said nothing, just then, to enthrall Sylvia, or to get her to repeat it. Instead, he sat down with his eyes closed and his mind turned to something else. At some point between two and four years of age, he had received from his mother an early printed book, composed, it is safe to say, in large measure to fill the absence of his beloved Juliet. It is no exaggeration to say that the volume of truth, with which this story begins, was a work of vast proportions. It closely matched the triangle, or more precisely followed closely to fit it: a cuboctaurea, or triangle of very large sizes, with three faces like that of the To meet in the northern quadrant was a goal which surpassed all other values.

====================
Dialog’s insides, he was going to forget about the doll-face thing. He was going to forget about Alice, her glasses and her homework problems. He was going to forget about Quentin, her, until he was blue in the face and dry.

			He was going to forget about Alice, her brown hair and her blue jeans, until he was blue in the face and dry, and then he was going to remember her. It was easy. He was so sure he wasn’t a ghost, and his colleagues were so sure Alice had been okay, but in his mind he was back, and he was right before the windows of the Arecibo Observatory, and the streetlamps were off, and the snow was black, and the trees were alive, and he was warm and smelly and silent and beautiful, and he felt the wetness of her mouth on his ear, and he felt everything, all of it, again, and he let it all go. It was all he’d ever wanted.

			And now he understood. It wasn’t so much that Fillory was real as that it was real enough. It was just: he’d never found the words.

			When he finally did find them, and he hadn’t even thought about them in a long time, the words were more power than he’d expected. They were much, much harder to find than he thought.

			When he looked up the words again it was as white as a sheet.

			“All I can say is reach for it, all you human scum, and hold on. The sun’s not going to come back to just where I left it, it’s going to be wherever the sun’s at.”

			That sounded like he was pointing at some invisible line, some invisible green triangle, a la the Eiffel Tower. He looked around: the snow-capped peaks were it, the sky was a golden-brown sheen, the ground was smooth and green. It made him feel like he was somewhere else, another world altogether.

			As he shouted those words, the snow had come a little faster, and the leaves were coming off more, but as he did Linda looked back at him calmly, as if she knew what he was thinking

			“But I believe me when I say that this book is going to blow your minds.” Quentin held up a hand as if to say “Off you go again,” but Martin shook his head. “Don’t bother. I’ve got it under my belt.”

			He walked over to the window and back-lit the room the way the light from a streetlamp would, and he could just see the tiniest sliver of Hibernia, the Eastern Seaboard: faint clumps of trees, quick-moving streams, high plains. The warm, uncloudy air on these islands was absolutely killer, and he wondered if he’d ever felt that way growing up.

			“You know,” he said, “I had a pet donkey. It lived at the foot of my stairs. Whenever I would pick it up, it would clamber up the stairs in a wobbly, suicidal attempt to get up again. I would stop and cry and cry and cry. I still felt its pain. I shook its fat, shivering body and held its sickeningly hot royal chest in my hands. It was like I’d got a present from my granddad.

			It was a bit of a shock when Janet said she had, in fact, got a present from her granddad. It was a bit of a shock when she mentioned that they’d found it in the middle of a bush in a remote corner of the island and that it was worth a whopping tons of gold. But Jin was worried, and he’d been feeling it too. It was because of them that he’d come here today, and not because of the donkey.

Deutsches Requiem



Staring at the picture of the radiant life that fills the sky like a crown of stars, I imagined myself dashingly along the narrow streets of a lovely city, enchanted by the spirits of the blind who walk the corridors and sun-blessed the balconies. I thought I saw the emperor crossing the Tuileries, eager to embrace the majesty of that opalescent splendor, to forget himself and to adore it.

This image is false. The empire is not the palace of an emperor: it is the human heart, blinded by lust, polluted by pride. Rome does not yawn with books: she humbles us with her humble beauty. The Muse, in Her infinite piety, fills the heart with a colorless joy. In England, this beauty is called Elizabethan Simplicity; in America it is Beauty and not Simplicity. I have said that the heart is a mirror of the mind; in Rome, the mind was Jerusalem blinded by the Bible. The city is blinded: we see: a little brighter, we should be. The Jews did not dare to see: they were persecuted; we, blinded by our beauty, should dare to love. The Jews were persecuted because they were the chosen people of God; we are the people of the mirror: we are the one who looks in at the public theaters and the taxicabs. Who can remember the scenes in the prisons, the meaningless jeers, the sneers, the inhuman tortures, the frenzied laying on of hands, the hideous images of pigs being hung, the horrible ugliness, the blasphemy against the sacred images? These scenes, these persecutions, are repulsive and inexplicable; much more plausible than the utopias dreamed up to be their mirrors.

More ridiculous, much more plausible is the idea that these unbelievable scenes do not happen. That they are very likely not to happen. That it is ridiculous to imagine that men of intelligence, who are capable of so much more than that, would commit so many outrageous crimes. I know that this is the opinion of some people; I believe it also. I believe it because I have experienced crime

It mediates between individuals and between states; it does this by way of rhetorical devices, by way of rhetorical situations, by way of rhetorical concepts. It is a non-hierarchical language: anyone can speak and anyone can imagine anything. The many-worded, the inflexible, the brief-termed, the ornamental, will not answer your question; I shall make it simple for you. . . To compose an essay is, for the young man of letters, to walk about in the world as a cobra; to read one's name on a book is, for the young man of letters, to become enamored of that particular cobra. Letters are policed by a cobra, which is the heart of the literary experience; the cobra is literature.

The cobra watches over you; you should seek it out and devour it. It is the secret patrimony of the snake. It is more precious than the precious stones of the city and the sky. It is talk of races, more precious than water and wood. It is embodied in the forms in which the letters are inscribed and in the pictorial language in which the letters are spoken. The cobra is embodied in the form of the grave; it sleeps among the grains of the earth and when you arrive at the end of the letter it withdraws itself into the nubbins of your stomach. You have come to a house.

This obverse is represented by the verb rem world a nd the noun grave . The reverse, rem n noun grave , is given by Plutarch.

Song of a Tub



When I was little, I never knew what was written under that pipe . . . I never knew that the white stone which makes up the foundation of my life was full of terrible stories related by men with lips that did not speak

As I busied myself in building worlds without boys , as I laborioust I labored on making women without husbands , so I labor now in building a world without brothers and sisters and fellow creatures.

The language I now write is one I have heard told , and yet I can see its date . . . The books I write will surely be later forgotten than
====================
Dialog, I am the Lord of the Rings, I am the bravest man on Earth, I am your enemy,
Who, riding over the Dnieper, could scarcely believe his ears:
He thought he was seeing the East, seeing the Far Side, where the woods grow black and the marshes yellow;
He thought he was riding the Dark Horse, expecting the Desert Fox,
Who guards the secret road to Parnassus.
He thought he was riding the Oceanus, hearing the Bellinis call;
He thought he was riding the White Stag, dreaming that every rock is a trap,
Knowing that the deepest darkness is the light of day.
He thought he was riding the God of the Ganges, seeing its hooves echo from flooded land to flooded land;
He thought he was riding the Wandering Bear, digesting the life-giving Sand,
Till Night breaks over the Desert.
He thought he was riding the Shrew, hearing the Earthworm's calls,
Till the rising sun dashes down into the Dark Continent.
He thought he was riding the Curly Bird, digesting the Yellow Bird,
Till Day breaks over the Gray Continent.
He thought he was riding the Cozy Tree, digesting the Cool Tree,
Till Summer ends at last over the Gray Continent.
He thought he was riding the Cloud Sedna, hearing the Cramped Tree,
Till the Yak and the Crow seek the Stone.
He thought he was riding the Plastered Train, hearing the Borers Sing,
Till dreaming travelers finish their ride,
Till the last whistle of the V.S. Wagner,
Till the silent watchword of the Turk,
Till the last leaf of the Oriental Willow,
Till the last leaf of the Oriental Willow.
He thought he was riding the Black or the Green Train,
Till pride swallows the land, till hope is only an / Inner Light.
He thought he was riding the Red Train,Till justice wastes the land,Till justice swallows the land,
Till hope is but an Inner Light.
He thought he was riding the Yellow or the Green Train,
Till a leaf turns from green to red,
Till a bushel of corn turns from yellow to red,
To become a bushel of yellow to become a bushel of yellow.
====================
Dialogis’s magnificent brain has been described by one of its successor orders as "the cram-school of the brain." It has all the hallmarks of a strict monograph: a bibliography, a section on "The Principles of Statistics," a glossary. A bibliography! The bibliography of a hundred pages devoted to the study of the Principles of Statistics. A hundred pages devoted to the study of meaner concepts ― i.e., to the study of how to say "bells and whistles" without sounding like a daft teenager who spent his childhoods in a fairy castle. A Pearson catalog devoted to the study of meaner concepts. A catalog of meaner concepts. A Pearson catalog. A Pearson catalog! ― the brain of one of those brilliant young researchers who put down their pens and leave it to readjust themselves on acid, is, I estimate, somewhere between a Wharton and a Zunz.

For all its superficial differences, the comparison of the two books ― which I am not even likely to have merited a rudimentary refutation ― must at once disclose, with astonishing clarity, the two weaknesses of the pseudo-Renaissance. The first is that of approximations. The second is that of similitude.

Suppose you have published a book which is 10,000 separate books, a book whose cover will vary in color from a light caramel turquoise to a dark chocolate brown. The first time you publish it, your peers may jeer at you, as if your first edition were a P. M.V.

Suppose another author of the pseudo-Renaissance, with a similar style and name, publishes his book. He may do so, instead of yours, because the latter will contain 10,000 variations, whereas the former, solely of literary interest, will contain only one.

If, a century from now, your contemporaries publish in a different language a biography of Columbus, venturing off into uncharted territories, they will recognize you because you are a writer of that kind, not because you were the first to publish a description of the New World.

If, half a century from now, your contemporaries publish in English a work of Marat's, advocating a system of organization which is identical to that of your adversaries, they will recognize you, not because you are the author of that system, but because of your literary talent, not because of

Dialog and his neck, the stone.

			“I’ve thought about what you have to say about mortality. I understand that it’s not something that happens to everybody like it is in the books, but still.”

			“I know about the books,” Plum said. “But I’ve been thinking—and I think this is important too, because it made Quentin so uncomfortable—I think there’s something else to it too. Are the dead really as dead as they seem? I mean are they as confused as we make them out to be?”

			“I keep thinking of it,” Quentin said. “We’re talking about Fillory, a very specific kind of haunting. Quentin, the dead don’t really exist. They’re a story we tell ourselves.”

			“Right,” Plum said. “So we’re imagining it, and that’s what counts.”

			She paused there, and she seemed to ponder Quentin, and she brought out a silent prayer in his ear that he would let her finish.

			“I’m not going to deny it,” she said. “I love Fillory. I have the most uncontrollable feeling in the pit of my stomach. But I have to tell you, the house was getting on my nerves. I could hear the family fighting, the whispering, the plotting, and I had to be there to watch it all happen.

			“Once they got back to the house, Rupert and Janet and Umber—”

			They were gone five minutes. Quentin was still trying to piece it all together. But he was starting to get an idea of who the other two were.

			“They were fighting a god,” Janet said. “A whole solar system of gods.”

			“A whole universe,” Umber said. “They’re fighting for a planet.”

			“A continent.”

			“An ocean island.”

			Janet looked up at the morning sunset and smiled.

			“They took it out
====================
Dialog’s baby.”

			“The dwarves will give them to you,” Stoppard said.

			“Why should I care? They’ll take it back once they know what’s inside it?”

			“No.” Eliot was shaking. He was so close. “They’re taking back a stolen thing.”

			“What thing?” Stoppard was still shaking. “You thought it was a damn horse!”

			“Then get this straight: I take it back, you take it back, dwarf versus human, battle of the sexes, in the underworld?”

			“You’re being ironic,” Janet said.

			“You’re befuddled. We’re being fucking brilliant. What is it?”

			“A horse,” Quentin said.

			“A fucking horse.”

			Even Janet was tempted to laugh: Fiona would have. But she showed her daughter Anatole, who she’d never seen before, and Stoppard, she introduced herself, and Anatole turned out to be the mysterious young lord of the mines she’d just left half-drunk in. Then she turned and went into the other wing, where the other guests were being entertained by the dwarfs and the fairies and the birds. It was just as she had suspected—all her fears were here, and they were even more intense than she realized.

			“All right,” Janet said. “We’re not quite ready to go to war, but I want to make sure you are.”

			“I can’t,” Eliot said. “I’m sick of this.”

			She kept her voice down so she wouldn’t sound defiant. Eliot had to keep reminding himself that this wasn’t a duel, and that there wasn’t anything magic could do to break it. And yet, suddenly all the subtleties of the magical world came flooding back to him. What was a red herring a conduit through which the full force of a magic

Dialog, he’d forgotten how. He’d been too busy trying not to look at the ceiling.

			“This place feels different than Fillory.” He held out his hand, stroking the skin. “It feels different from Ember’s Lair, I guess.”

			“Both of those are different worlds, though. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve wandered into Fillory and thought, No, that isn’t the same world. It shouldn’t be possible.”

			“And then I’ve got these adventures,” Poppy said. “And then I realize that it’s possible, because you don’t have to feel anything to appreciate what you’re seeing. Whereas with Fillory it was always clear to me that I was being deliberately ignored. You know? Because you’re not the only one who’s had stories about the Fillory afterworld. Everybody else has them. If you’re not feeling them, they’re lost. I’ve been wondering if there was another way in, finding them if there was one.”

			Quentin nodded.

			“I don’t know if you realize it,” he said, “but there’s no one left.”

			That was magic. Fillory had a silent but very real descendant. Quentin couldn’t think of a single person who hadn’t had their own Fillory story, or was about to have their own.

			“Wait,” he said. “Also you mentioned Ember’s Lair. Does that include its twin, Ember’s First Chamber, its father, the great pit that was Ember’s Finery, and the others as well? And the one after that?”

			“They do.”

			“There’s an entire tower built on the remains of That],[gem-encrusted and stamped with a mysterious tapestry of greens and browns],” Janet said. “It’s called the Queenswood. It was the strongest magic you could build. Even Martinus’s
====================
Dialogis, in his recent book Metaphor and Reality, uses the phrase "morpheus in a bag of holding." The idea is that the word "bag" has a mythical origin and is a reminder of one of those absurdities on which philosophy struggles, the phantasy of Homer or the absurd geography of Plutarch. Plato used the word metaphoris (memory) to denote the art of concealing or representing ideas in mind; Aristotle said that it denoted the art of organizing and regulating memory, or of of of forming ideas into memories.

The idea seems sound; it has been suggested that the use of the Egyptian name for the art of memory (metaphor) is in some way inappreciative; however, the definition of Aristotle gives it as follows: "Memory, a system of ideas, is the combining of the ideas of the mind together, into a visual representation, and of the ideas of the mind together, into a tactile sensation." Metaphor is, as it were, a visual representation; it is a verbal shorthand by which we indicate to others the arrangement of the objects in a scene, the arrangement of the objects in a scene, and so on to infinity. From this visual representation we can infer, from the words employed, the mental objects to be, and the mental objects to be arranged in a mental series. There is nothing in the word "display" (et igituras) which does not imply, in some way, the series of objects which implies the series of objects. There is nothing virtual (archaismique) in the saying, "The end justifies the means." The equivalent Greek phrase would be, "A camel in the camp is not a bother to the enemy" or "The discovery of the Petri dish is not a great event to the commanders of armies in front of and below the river."

It is well known that the Egyptians understood music to be a code for magic, and that the breaking of musical codes was considered a military necessity. There is also some truth in the conjecture that the act of singing was not merely the verbal expression of physical feelings, but also of mental feelings. Music and poetry had the quality of connecting the mind and were the feelings repeated were more intense, more frequent and more simple, then the repeated music and poetry became an elaborate code or spell.

It has been conjectured that the speech and poetry of the ancestors of the Egyptians were inherited
====================
Dialog’s a big feller too.”

			“You could say that. But no.” She shook her head. “This is your fight, Quentin. Maybe you can win it, but you can't win this thing.”

			“But I can!” Him so. “This is my war, faggot! This is my war against the world! I can’t stay home! I can’t sit on a knee around!”

			The boy shut up. He was shaking, he was angry, he was tired. Quentin stepped forward cautiously, feeling like he was riding a guttural wave, his pants practically squishing himself, and he placed a finger on the corporal’s ribcage, feeling for any vulnerability, anything he could get a good grip on. The corporal’s eyes were closed, but the ache in his chest told Quentin that he was waking. Quentin took a deep breath, and he did the only thing he knew how to do: He kicked the door in the corporal’s head clear off its hinges.

			He fell face first into the murky, frigid water. It wasn’t much, just a towel or a wet sand-shoal or some such, but it was cold. He was underwater, and it was cold. He had a bit of a roll in it, or rather a hazy, but it was still annoyingly icy. He’d been snowboarding all year, and being sneezed on by a giant squid was not one of them. It was just that this was taking a huge bite out of his otherwise full stomach.

			He’d been meditating, and then worshiping, and then praying, and then working on getting his spiritual hunger under control, but it had come back in a big, unconscious way the next morning. The thing had come for him. Now everything was a fight or flight situation. He could feel its slick, fat, overcooked, oily paws on his back, nails clicking over soft fur, and it was about to sink its fangs when he saw that it wasn’t going to drown him, not till it’s all the way down. It was going to save my life.

			He jerked his
====================
Dialog, a kind of auxiliary speech. I don't know if he really thought of it before, but it seemed to him that all the other rules of grammar were secondary matters, for which he had to pay no attention. The same thing happened with verbs. For instance: I speak French, but not Italian. I am not a descendant of Lorenzo Bingu Ambrosio, but I can say that he is a great poet.

This kind of talk, much of it nonsensical, much of it aimed at getting attention, was going on all around us. Ambrosio, Ambrosio, speaking at the Bataclan, addressed a jubilant voice, large and proud, high and boisterous, French and Slavic, of the grandeurs. The joke was on him. But the joke was being made by someone else, me. I had come here because of my friend Bruno, someone who had just died. I remember him with affection, as do a great many people. I remember him with glee, as do a great many people. We were going over the same problems over and over again, and we laughed out loud at the same absurd problems. Someone had set the music to a symphony and the slightest variation would have the spectators joining in and lapsing into fits of laughter. Ambrosio, laughing out loud, had set the music to a symphony. We were entering a labyrinth.

We were all entering a labyrinth. The walls were high, the ceiling was also high, the floor was also high, and the furniture consisted of little cube-chairs, square-roofed rooms, little square balconies, little lairs with thin walls and long courtyards. The elevators were always running to somewhere else. The elevators were always running to somewhere else. There were no kitchens. The kitchens were always always always running to somewhere else. And so on endlessly, all the way to the edge of the earth.








The Library of Babel



With no other actions than these it was impossible to commit the last mission of life: to seek, on some vast unknown continent, the word with which thee hast Thou hast renounced the prison of Thy flesh and given birth to a incorruptible and life-giving Word. Thou hast abolished the prisons of time and of matter; in a word, in all directions Hast sent us this overwhelming Object. Though the performance of this
====================
Dialogs, and the poetry of the hour. I am himself the dervish of my number (13), the palustrated arena (14), the mirror (15), the doubled door to the next room (16). My numbers are also doubles, doubles of myself. My double is the mirror, the door, the flame.

I have said that, at times, I have thought myself to be blind. Such a conjecture (which I do not intend to defend myself from) seems almost incredible to me now. The fact is that I have had a vision of Peter the Blind, whom God for the glory of God has made visible in this world and in the world to come. It is less certain that I have not had a vision of Peter the Unknown, the eternal, the Invisible. (For a description of this possibility, see Dreyfus's book.)

At first, I confined myself to assiduous meditation. What vision have I? Has God revealed to me the image of the beast in the gate? Or the image of the fish in the harbor? I did not find the books of the Shem Hamephorite family until some one had written against them in a book denouncing the Ptolemaic system of magic? Or of the Shem Hamephorite family until someone had written in favor of it? Or the Shem Hamephorite family until someone had written in its favor? And so on to infinity? God only knows. But no, I knew that I was a leper, that I was devoured by the darkness which consumed me, that I remained a leper. I knew that, if I was not rescued, someone would be the moment I leave the house; soon I would be cast adrift in the darkness, a fish on a sand-curtain, a prisoner of the divers and terrible currents. I sought light, I sought relief in books. I reached the second volume of one of these works, the first part of the story of the sons of Zarahemlak, the last king of Judah.

This light was that given me by that vision. I did not look at the page alone, I looked at it in turn, I felt its words on each successive page, I felt each word, anticipation, repulsion, as it came and went, chanted over me by the Spirit, making me later, again and again, hear the words
====================
Dialog shone. It should have been night, but it was already sinking.

			“Night,” she said. “Night.”

			“The Light is dead.”

			That was all they needed to know. The Light was dead. But what then? For Jane they knew that they were telling a story, the story of a house, a house of Fire, and that this was how it should have been, would be. And Plum too: that was how the story began.

			Plum sat up, for a minute. The rug had supported her perfectly, but now it gave only tingle and heat, and she could feel the supporting fabric trembling. She got the impression that nothing she’d ever did for a man had any practical effect.

			In the darkness they found an old fluorescent light bulb, the kind that goes up in a circle, not up, not working. They found a way to turn it on.

			They started from the ground, beginning with the least daring of their DIY trespasses. Betsy began by scaling the wall in front of the twins’ door, wobbling a little as she went, her steps quick-fixing the taut skin at the top. Lionel followed closely behind, swaying only slightly, swaying because there was a sharp crack, a crack where something hard had struck the plastic wraparound, and the bulb had snapped.

			That made it four, which is when Plum got nervous. They’d been too careless, and she was starting to look like the girl next door, and the thing was following her. But what if it was the other way around? What if it was the other wall? What would she do now? They could cast Confusion on it, paralyze it, whatever they wanted, but it would never figure out a way to get out. The spell would do, right, it would think, is that chip on its face, and it would be paralyzed. It wouldn’t know what to do. It would be like a fly in its cocoon.

			Then Betsy got stuck, and the rug gave way and dropped painfully on her, and her hands went still, and her head spun. The wall shook itself apart under her feet, sending ripples down the long corridor, and the carpet of the

DialogWhen you're done, you can keep the sword." She took out a piece of paper from her purse. "Name it after me."

			“I will.” He felt an incredible sense of pride. When he decided on a name, as far as he knew it already belonged to him. It wasn’t just a random riddle, it was part of his. He embraced her. She was right—he was a reborn Fillory. Now was the time. This was his moment.

			Plum embraced him whole-heart-beyond-his-years.

			“You are going to die, Quentin,” she said. “But you have my love, and this world’s, and this world’s, and we don’t give out goddamn love spoils anything for us. We take it in turns.”

			She held out the paper for him to sign. He did so, and then handed it back to her.

			“This should say business,” he told her. “In case you weren’t paying attention.”

			She studied it, then studied something else, then put the letter down.

			“I am not a demon,” she said, “but I am very close. In fact I think you are a demon now. And I am a demon now.”

			She seemed to be making some sense to her.

			“You are a book, Plum,” Quentin said.

			She studied him, blinked, looked away, made a face.

			“You are a book,” she said. “But you’re a lot less book than you think. Most of what I say sounds obvious, obvious to everybody, but it’s not. It’s not obvious to me.”

			She looked at Quentin.

			“I don’t see any imps in this room.”

			“I don’t think so.”

			“No matter what, we have to hide, right? I think that’s what this is all about. Is that clear?
====================
Dialogs, I shall be your guide through the waters of death."

			And Martin felt that he too had been granted such a vision, though he could not remember whence. It must have been in some part of the world he couldn’t be in the United States now, because he ceased to feel the warmth of its facades. There were no more skyscrapers on Manhattan’s highest points anymore: they were now terraced gardens or meadows. There was a new bloodless glamour to the capital’s character. The lawns were always brusquely iced over from summer to winter, when the cattle would gorge themselves on them from above, sending up frothy white sludge below.

			Quentin wondered if he’d been nice to her, if he could have been a bit more reassuring. He hoped he could have. But he couldn’t. They wouldn’t have let him. The thing was different now. The grief was different. The world was bigger and more complicated than it used to be.

			There was no place like home, but for all his longing, Martin didn’t yet know where he was going. He was tempted—had been—by the idea of just staying where he was, in Barnes and Sprout, but that left him no more room to expand than if he were to hurl himself down a well. So he determined that he at least go home to Where Trees Begin, where every night before dawn he sets out to plant a new tree—there’s a tree in every lane, every floor, every room, every block—and every day before noon he does the same for each of his own. That should do it. But every now and then he wonders if all that hard work isn’t just a sham, if there really isn’t any real depth to his search, if there really isn’t any real forest behind it. And the more he thinks about it, the more he realizes that there is. There is a trunk, and a trunk with an trunk.

			There was once a time when Martin must have known where he was going with all his heart—the next life, or the thousand next worlds. He was going to be a tree, or a rose-colored tree, or a flowing rose, or a healing rose, or a royalty

Dialog.

			“I was just thinking about how important it is that we all keep this family name,” Eliot said. “I mean, we all have—"

			“I know. It’s a shame.” He trailed off.

			“But I’m thinking about, like, Athl one, two, three. Four. Five. Six. It would be nice.” Plum did a quick count across the invisible, unspoken distance between herself and Eliot, a quick count to see if she was off, but her fingers stopped.

			“I don’t know how many there are,” she said.

			“Sixes.”

			“Maybe there’s just one of us. Maybe there’s a whole family.”

			“I don’t know any more about my family tree than you do,” Eliot said, “so can you just check back in on my grandma?”

			“I can’t,” she said. “Go check something out. I’m sure she would approve.”

			She walked away, back to the warm glow of the kitchen when the window was glowing like a librarian would after hours in a dark room. She felt faint in the very streetlights, light from the streetlamps, her 20th-century suburbanidad washed away by the washing machine. By the time she was back in the open country, back to Manhattan, to the real world, it was too late. The bullet had pierced her heart; it had torn through her body like a bathing suit.

			She was jogging back to Pier 391 when she felt like giving a hug.

			“I feel like I just got my heart broken,” she whispered.

			It was the third time in as many days that she was this close to tears, and she was going to hold them together, like a champ. Just like a champ. Like a champ she was. But first they were all going to get married. They were winners. Smarter than the rest, better thinkers, more compassionate, more suited to the species they were going to be. She wished Eliot were
====================
Dialog’s a fucking bear,” Quentin said. “He’s a fucking bear.”

			He didn’t mean it as a criticism, he just meant that he didn’t know of any other explanation. The bird had been feasting on the dead body of a dead bird for hours now, at least seven or eight at the latest. It must have found it particularly revolting, because it settled on Quentin and gobbled him up in one gulp, eating him up whole and up and up and up and up until his lifeless body was only a puddle of feathers and shit.

			Quentin didn’t even feel sorry for it. It was a dead bird, and dead where it lived, and there wasn’t much organic matter left anyway. Maybe it was simply hungry, or bored, or whatever Quentin had never had a pet and was going to have to look for a really good signposts from which to derive pleasure from it. Or maybe Fillory was happy for him. Maybe he’d just have to find a new habit.

			He was going to have to break the cardinal rule of photography: don’t take anything away. In real life there was nothing left for him there, not even a bit the color or the shape he wanted. But in Fillory he saw something he hadn’t seen since Yneslof had taken him under the wing of his ancestor Thorwald. It was a place, a language, a place where red and blue and white didn’t mix, where not every object was a potential threat or a potential escape, and where not every object had a story. He found a piece of his past, and his world, and he was so moved by the sight that he almost lost his balance and fell over.

			When he came to his feet he found that the red and blue wards had been blown out and his entry into Fillory restored. All was right with him. He was home. He was back.

			He was standing in front of a door to a room exactly like the one he’d been in at seven, room B. He was taking a deep breath, studying the little clock dial on the wall, when the door opened and three people with sharply defined faces and red eyes as big as hockey pucks walked in.

		
====================
Dialogs are just different versions of the same topic. If you ask me, the most important thing in The Handmaid's Tale is that big, enigmatic question: Where is everybody going? That's the central conceit, the heart of the book.




In the first part of the novel you will see me talking about that conceit, because I think it is very clear-cut. In the second part of the book you will see me talking about a different conceit: about the shape of the lucky stars.

The story of the escape and the sword is one single allegory, written in a few capitals and then quickly and awkwardly expanded into many languages. To understand it it is helpful to know a little Greek.

ἐπὶ τὸν σκόλειν ἐπὶ τὸν θεὸν οὐκ τὰ μὲν καὶ τὰ ὁ οὐκ τὰ μέτρων τὰ οὐκ τὰ καὶ τῶν καὶ τῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τὰ θεὸν καὶ τὰ ἐπὶ τὰ καὶ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ καὶ τὰ τὰ τὰ ναὶ τὰ ἐπὶ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ τὰ ναὶ ναὶ

====================
Dialog, the grammar of a dead world. I am unable to express the astonishment and terror I feel when I think of that great man who, amid the dialects and superstitions of that barbaric and barbarous age, had conceived in his lifetime a system which makes of English the language of happiness, of virtue, of felicity, and is the language of all ages. I believe I have proved this to be the case.

The following are some of the devices by which Pliny's Britannicus represents the nations of the world.

Language. Plinyus distinguishes three vocabularies: (1) the natural, which is communicated by thought, (2) the acquired, which is acquired; (3) the acquired, which is acquired through practice. The former is constant and invariable; the latter changes according to the changing times and nations. Plutarch attributes to the latter the quality of magic, because it functions not only as a criterion of excellence, but also of unlimited improvement. The difference between the operations of the natural and those of the acquired vocabularies is this: those of the natural vocabulary has six consonants, that of the acquired six, that of imaginary five. The existence of this imaginary vocabulary, that of imaginary ones, has been noted by a certain Pliny. I believe I have demonstrated this by means of a kind of which I shall never be unaware.

Tongue. This vocable is simple and direct; it touches the heart and is sweet. It is made up of two sounds: one which sounds like a soft rustle of leaves, another like the voice of a bird. He who speaks this sentence, which sounds exactly like this, becomes my slave, I am your slave. I speak, you think, say, hear. The third, fourth and fifth syllables form a word; the fourth, a vowel. The eighth sound, the nasal consonant. This word is what you cannot think, say, feel, see, hear, imagined. Pliny places the origin of this illusion below the ages; but I think that to suppose that Europe was once divided into nations by this means of sound has a very remote possibility. We Argentines are no longer nations, we are multiform tribes or communities of tribes. We are tribes of men; we are multiform languages; we are even confused and effaced languages. We spoke one language, another, another

			“Well, you know,” Plum said, this time with some gravity.

			“I guess you’d be able to say that about a lot of things.”

			Quentin was still staring at the blackboard.

			“Does that mean I can come and go as I please?”

			“Offer rescinded.”

			“All right.”

			Plum looked up and bowed—apprehensive, even a little embarrassed.

			“No,” he said. “I don’t think so.”

			“Well, come to that.”

			This time the board folded down flat for him, revealing three feet of smooth black stone. He levered the slab back up and away from the wall, then squared off its thick sides against one another to form a frame. He leveled the workday’s first section—a thick slab of iron and steel with a silver field around one end—off to one side. It rose smoothly, until it crackled with energy, then groaned loudly as it was disrupted by one last, massive collision.

			Quentin was still working on the second panel, but he’d already begun working on the first. He liked the look of the first piece, which was a jumble of tiny windows, some of which were on the same side as the door, but others opposite. He liked the look of the one opposite, which was a pretty woman. He added a door at the back. He liked the way the white letters on the frame caught his eye:

Throat

“Forward

“Through

“Backward

At first he thought it was a joke, but then he looked closer and saw it was all there: a long filleted window step running along the ceiling, with a toilet behind it. He stuck his head through. The warm moist air was cool and damp, like when you snuggle with a dead frog. Something was missing. He tried to focus his senses: the ground was tingling, and the walls were going cold. The only sound was the rushing of wind through wire mesh doors.

		
====================
Dialog. We know that the epigrams of that generation form a single work, entitled, I understand, the title of which is Hadit Hadadvm, the Wandering One. This is apparent from the fact that the author of the first epigram is not identified with the author of the second, but is stated to dwell in the Desert of the Long Vigil. One of the precursors to the religion of Zeno is to be found in that of Nabuchodonosor; it is no less observable that the religion of Nabuchodonosor was also a synthesis of Buddhism and Parsltrache, and that the religion of Zeno is a synthesis of Parsltrache and Dante.

The foregoing substantiates what has been said; and it also disproves what has been said about it. We see that, in spite of the immense space which has been devoted to the imitation of that generation, very few people, if any one at all, has been able to make use of it as a model. It is impossible to say with any certainty what portion of mankind has not been deceived by the image; very possibly the God of those days was a result of that generation's imagination, and has borrowed something from its process. Perhaps the following facts are decisive: (1) The former theological system is found in all the principal sources of that religion; (2) The latter system is peculiar to that country; (3) The invention of the wheel in the year 1824, considerably altered the course of history; (4) In the course of two centuries, the two historical processes ― the process of invention and the process of change ― reached, inter alia, the mind of Elihu Tenayba and, finally, that of Eliyahu V of Zuni.

It is sufficient for me to recall two examples: the one with its trigrams, the other with its mythical heroes; the first is the narrative of the destruction of the castle of Tlön by fire and water, and the second is that of the crossing of the River Rubicon. Both these magnificently realized systems, two aspects of the same phenomenon, are demonstrated by a single statement. In the first place, to say that two systems ― one historical, one mythical ― can succeed and prosper is a form of intuition; in the second place, there is no logical reason why one system ― the history of Ninian Tenayba ― and another (),

―Pierre Menard, Quixote ~ HG Wells, Outer Limits

The concept of time is perhaps most readily recognizable in science-fiction literature ― stories, films, games, comics, parables, archetypes ― but for many ordinary people, the earliest experiences of which a story is composed, the earliest references to its themes and characters, the most acute of all being their parents' nervous breakdowns when they learned that their son was going to be a space diver, marks the beginning of their disillusionment and their eventual separation from their loved ones. This essay will attempt an in-depth study of one such split, that of Blue Steel and White Rose, a story that won the 1947 Nobel Prize in Literature, and won the Nobel Prize in 1947 as well.

The story is as old as literature itself, and can be dated back as far as the astrolabe that revealed its first verse. It goes as follows:



A grateful god made of clay,

Created Adam, endowed him

With all the desires and intentions

Of a human being;

And Eve, his faithful wife,

Delivered birth to a son,

A dream that proved a son,

A stinging serpent that killed

The last of the serpents,

And made into a man,

The second of the divine Trinity.



The basic structure of most epic poems is the one recited by the Homeric poems:



Fiery god,

Founding force,

Founding father,

Give your substance for an offering,

Grant me your elements

And I will give my substance for an offering.

The elements are strength, water, fire,romantic content. The offering is the tripartite formula of justice, honesty, and truth. The tripartite formula has often been quoted with approval by Hladik:

And here he is. I suppose that we, the senses, ought to feel sympathy for those of our animate nature which is annihilated by an impersonal force. I do not know, but I hope that this is not the case.

I recall that Countess de Bacourt had a son, Jean, who is now four years old. He is very pretty, and I am sorry he died young: my hope is that his quiet dignity and brave death will allow him to spend his last moments in quiet and obscurity, with the peace and tranquillity that belong to him, not to his ancestors, who have caused him so much pain.

I close by repeating the sentence I tore from you, Bruticus, my last.

Euripides, Cyclopean Heroes

Clementina Villani (Milan, 1928- ) was one of the most penetrating and original critics of modern literature of the second half of the twelfth century. Her essays, characteristic of her style and subject matter, are not so much historical essays as humorous, allegorical or symbolic essays. Villani (who was always, especially during the summers, capable of persuading herself to write letters) was always careful to specify her points of view, though she was always able to obtain an audience with the authorities she cited. Her statements sometimes reached opposite ends; as she often observed, they often conflicted. In an article on the generals of the Protestant Reformation she objected to the harsh justice of leading them to hell and then appealing to the mercy of God to spare them. The answer she derived was that it is cruel to execute sinners, but that God justifies sinners and justifies them: "The divine mercy consists in justification, but it is more merciful to pardon sins and to bring about justification than to bring about justification and to bring about pardon." She then observed that it is absurd to see God as a weak and brief temporal Being, to see Him as a great and eternal Being, infinitely delicate and dependent on chance. God is Faithful, but Mutable, Intriguing, Philosophic, Vindicating, Denying and Ennobling us, according to His Will ; according to Our Will.

Villani is often compared with Botticelli, but their style is much more varied. Villani's theoretical essays often echo those of Botticelli, but his verbal experiments are much more daring.
====================
Dialog

After a year of war and a disastrous and costly middle war, after ten years of peace and ten of war, the country was at last free. The young republic was in its triumphal triumph, dashing triumphal wings fluttering behind it, radiant and bloodthirsty and triumphant. Beneath the splendor of its triumph a monster was waiting, and it was not the night howling wind of a calm day; it was not the distant cannonading below, but a terrible howl, and before them all, the monstrous horse that had fled from Paseo del Carmen, all night, now rose and charged and charged and gripped the height they knew they were fighting on, which now seemed endless and engendering them. Aeons of ages had passed, but the memory of that night still animated those who had not been able to forget it.

It was a day unconnected, for the unconnected day already existed. The two days preceding it were years of peace, of which I the writer (I did not know at the time) am extremely proud. The years 1848 and 49 were also years of peace, but this time the years were of the international variety, those of Paolo Bacigalupi and Daniel Defoe and Robert Fulton Beecher, and more recent and complicated and international. The wars of the previous century had weakened us, had diminished us, maybe, but they had also strengthened us, given us the strength to face the unknown and the sublime. In the first war we defeated an enemy that was almost immortal; in the second, an enemy that was so weak that we could subdue and confine him. Against a background of total war and total peace, in which great changes were happening rapidly and extensively, we found ourselves, in the midst of two years of total peace, with the unusual rarity of years in which total peace was the rule and total war the exception, Colombia and the United States were forced to experience, in order to realize their promise. Colombia and the United States had a secret promise, an inexpressibly large and improbable secret promise, a secret pact that could alter the face of the world.

It was during those years that my father, who had not looked back from the page of his life, once more witnessed the gleam of the telegram. It was that year ― 1848 ― when a group of Spanish anarchists, under the leadership of José Saramagojas

I know that I cannot begin to enumerate the refutations against monism I have enumerated, or to name all the difficulties I have encountered along the way, though I feel I have justified myself to your great reading of Ibn-Sharaf of Al-Rashiduna (privately printed) and to the Muslim (published in Cairo in 1209) and testify that I have not resorted to half-truths, either common to my writings or to those of the times.

I wish first to mention a text which you state precedes all others, antecedent to all others, but which also characterises the work of all the others ― theFiendish Book of the Anticipation of the Last Judgment of Muhammad, trans. Thomas Harvey (London, 1889). This book contains the ten propositions of monism exemplified by Ibn-Sharaf; its exposition by Mr. Harvey (who was incarcerated for his crime) did not take place until two or three decades later, in a work written by his intimate companion, Abdullah Bin Yazid. I shall pass over the exposition of these ten propositions by Mr. Harvey, who after citing numerous authorities adduced no difficulties whatever. I shall also pass over the exposition of these ten propositions by Mr. Harvey, who (like his contemporary,) lacking sources, has collected his adversaries' statements encyclopedic fashion. I pass over this exposition, which I copy from the pen of Muhammad Al-Basri, a tafsirist from Sirte. I find this passage: "The Book of the Just is a tradition or revelation from Allah, it is not a revelation from men, nor is it a revelation from anything that has happened in the world. The Book of the Just records what Allah has remembered, what Allah will remember, what Allah wills, what Allah has had, what Allah has had and what Allah is going to have. Hence those who read this book will know that Allah is wise and knows all things. And whoever does not read this book will know that Allah is forgetful and has forgotten things. And whoever does not remember this book will know that Allah is big and encompasses all things. Hence those who read this book will know that Allah is vast and applies to all things and applies to Allah only, and to none else. Hence those who forget this book will know that Allah is obscure and to all things and to Allah only, and to none else

Dialogical writing. It would be an insult to that character who does not know, or would like to know, the name of that volume which makes him master of himself.

For several years past I have sought a code for my acts. I have thought I have found it, though I know I have not. I have sought an alphabet by means of which I shall be capable of anything; but the task I have embraced would place me ipso ultra far astra. I am no longer the man I was, but the man of letters I was then. One thing more: the writing of that code is in me; it is in my nature, it is in the very being of that page which I pens. The more I pen, the more clearly I see through its opaque threads the incomprehensible mosaic which is reality. The more absolutely I perceive reality the more incomprehensible and useless is reality to myself. Reality is a cloak for my soul, a covering which will only be broken by a terrible act which would plunge me back into that reality. Such is the testimony of innumerable witnesses.

Man's origin is mystery to himself; the more he expounds the earth, the more he discovers is that it is a costly mantle, that the animal form would be garish, that the animal would be ignoble. What is reality but that which I communicate to you, my readers? I do not expound the earth to myself, because I know that act, that act is that act which is the act which everyone else also does. Therefore, do not you see that the mystery of life is in us, that the only thing to us is the drama of evolution?

My Struggle

I felt myself to be devoured by the mythology of Teotihuacan, by the fables of that region. The priests would say to me in Teotihuacan: You, like other man, want to worship a dog, another god, another sky? I tell you with what an irony these words came! Unfortunately, I do not have the pains to repeat them now. I could enumerate a multitude of instances; one of them is worthy of notice. I have observed it with some weight: Aged twelve, I went to live as a free man in the interior of Mexico; at that time, anything was possible. I did not see the face of my father, I did not know his name,

Dialog. He couldn’t remember everything he’d said, but he did remember how it began.

			It started with this:

			“I love you,” Quentin said.

			“I love you,” she said. Her eyes were red, but he’d got a sense of her mood, because later that day she’d had a manicure and a donee.

			“I love you,” he said again.

			“I do,” she said.

			Quentin had to fight some urge to take her up on that love. It was the most sensual thing in the world. He could take her back, he knew it, and he would take her back as well. He would take her mind, his mind, his mind, both. He would take her soul, maybe, and make room for a place in it for Brakebills, and whatever else. Maybe that was what he deserved. He wasn’t sure yet. But he knew that this was who she was, and he wouldn’t be turning her over to the wrong hands or the wrong people.

			“I don’t know what I want, but I want a mind like your mind,” she said. “I don’t want your money, but I’m going to get mine.”

			“I know,” he said. “But it’s all wrong.”

			“It is. I want your mind, and I’ll give you mine. Or yours. I don’t know which one you prefer.”

			She took that as a no, and they began to peel back the wrapping paper. Quentin smelled rot and tar and plastic until it blended with the plastic.

			“You want it all, don’t you? You can have it all. Mine, hers, anybody’s mind is it? Right?”

			She touched one of the windows and another one and the outside wall. It was the most basic thing, but it showed they’d got the hang of it. This wasn’t a total conversion project. This

Dialog and the sacred geometry of Morien. He had dreamed of the three-dimensional Euclidean world, or at any rate the Leibnizian one, but Descartes had shown him the narrow, noisy, and tedious world of Matter. In other words, Descartes had shown him the universe as it really was, in its interwoven webs and apparent contradictions, but Eliot had seen it only as it was in Hegel's dialectics: a definite, absolute, and absolute in time T^ = aT^T. Since then he has known it to be nothing less than that: the very unity of the Absolute in time T = aT^T. The latter fact (to wit, that there is a subject) is self-evident, but the difficulty lies in their thinking that self-evident. In the preceding pages it has been observed that subject and predicate noun follow each other, and this process is called "the impression of the preceding nouns." Another process is that of the "impressions" of the preceding ones. We say that Narciso's hands are red, when we say that his hands are red, because we have once cognized his identity as such. A similar process happens in all thought; namely, that the succession of mere phrases (and their connexions) is an illusion. Let us apply this illusion to the preceding one.Kant said, more or less categorically, that the subject and the predicate noun follow each other. This proof, however, did not clarify anything; it merely confirmed what we already knew. The preceding sentences formed a larger pattern, a larger trick, a larger instrument than the one before it. There I thought I had found the source of this illusory debt, but now see I realize that I myself play the parts of the debt. I am the note, I am the note, I am the note, I am the note, I am the note, I am the note, I am the note, I am the note, I am the debt, I am the note, I am the note, I am the note, I am the note, I am the debt, I am the note, I am the note, I am the note, I am the debt, I am the note, I am the note, I am the note, I am the debt, I am the note, I am the note, I am the note, I

			“I know what I like.”

			“Tell me about it.”

			“I like being a magician,” she said. “Being able to kill people.”

			He couldn’t hear her, but his heart rate started to pound less and less painfully, and he felt like he was being carried, carried along by a wind from somewhere far away. He climbed out of the canoe and walked stiff, heavy magic fingers that he’d managed to hang onto for almost three feet. He felt like he might shatter the canoe with them still strapped to them, so he stepped lightly through it and stepped gingerly through the door again.

			It was still open.

			“Hang on,” he said. “I think I’ll be needing this for a bit.”

			He stood up and walked over to the window and looked out, over the peninsula to the city below, the city down below. Down below where the sea was flat and quiet again. He looked up at the East Coast for the first time in four years. He looked up at the night sky.

			It used to be cold. It used to be dry. It used to be real. Where is Plum? He’d been here twenty-four hours; it must have been a long time ago. He was thirteen years old that day.

			Now little girls played with orange boats in little canopies over the water; now they played with red cafés on the sidewalks; now boys rode stilts on cathedrals; everybody knew where he’d been. In the shadow of the church the skin of the pillars broke the sky; in the half light of the cathedrals the faces of the statues were ephemeral. In the half light of the cathedrals the faces of the statues were inexorably motionless. In the half light of the cathedrals the faces of the statues were never-changing. In the half light of the cathedrals the faces of the statues were never-changing. In the half light of the cathedrals the faces of the statues were never-changing.

Dialog’s tongue jutted out of his cheek.

			They approached it. The grassy plains were still pink—but the sky was a deep purplish-blue. The Liège was in the East Anglian Summers, which meant it was also summer. A cool night breeze floated arete the low hills; they looked out onto the Moselle. A broad strip of clear blue sky, the width of the Moselle, to the west.

			“This is Montmartre,” Pascal said.

			“This is a fucking joke.”

			“It’s a joke.”

			He walked up to the counter and threw his arms around the neck of the register, and the bird lunged at him, and it ripped auctic ligament in his right knee cap, and it flew 40 feet in the air, and it hit the concrete, and it burst both claws into two more, and Betsy got it for him, and she cried. It was her first time doing this, but it was good, because it seemed to be going away. It’s not like he’d lost anything, his patch of desert in particular was protected, and now he could go and find what he came for.

			“I take it back,” Stoppard said. “I take it you’re looking for Rupert’s diary.”

			“Search it. Do you understand me, Quentin?”

			Stoppard looked at the ceiling. He was a big man, which was part of the joke, but he was a doctor, and a magician, and a psychiatrist, and he knew a lot about mentally ill people. He tapped his chin and fumbled something in his pocket. “Do you want me to fucking consult Rupert?”

			“What? Resist?”

			“Cold gods. Cold goddesses. Cold men. Cold gods,” Quentin said.

			“Cold fucking gods,” she said. “Now get out of here. I don’t want to live here.”

			But she didn’t say that. She didn’t even move. Quentin just watched her, as if she were a few feet away.

			“What are you doing here?” Plum said.

			“I don’t know.”

			“Well, don’t you want something done to you,” Plum said. “Or don’t you want to help us, anyway?”

			“I don’t know.”

			“Or do you?”

			“Do you?”

			“Then get out of here.”

			And she disappeared.

			He was brushing his short blond hair back behind him, polishing off his skateboard, when I came trotting up behind him.

			“No. Not at all. If you want a real answer, take the sack out of the medicine chest and look in the top drawer. There’s a lock of fire in there too, by the way. You’re not supposed to look in those. There’s a magical seal there that we only break ourselves when we decide there’s more in there than we’ve revealed.”

Dialog’s with his dad, which I guess is kind of his forte. But no, this was different. This time he was in over his head. He was going to break the seal and free Fillory, but he wasn’t going to break it perfect.

			“It’s not broken,” Plum said.

			“It wasn’t. It’s just better prepared now.”

			“Really, though,” she said, “if this is it, we’re done.”

			That was all she said. The three of them stepped away from the wheel and up onto the platform. From the outside it looked the same as any other day: three enormous, glowing, completely naked men in sky-blue suits and black shirts, standing around on the grass holding spears and chanting and pointing guns. But clearly this wasn’t another new frontier—this was Fillory, baby, and this was where the frontier really began. Plum walked up to the gate and announced her presence.

			It opened automatically, as it would when the moon was at its zenith. The gate-keeper looked at her for a long time, before he gave her the nod. The gate of the Far Side of the World was open to her.

			She stepped through it unhurt. All was right with her again. Everything was right with her. She was a princess, and she was free.

			As she stepped out of the carriage it was as if the Faerie Hall–Crobe had flared and spit fire out in all directions—her father’s gun had started shooting again, farther out, in the direction of the two guards who had stopped her. A bullet bounced off her belt, caught her mid-step, bounced up and landed on the hood of her carriage, which was completely dark except for the glow of the Candelabra.

			She stepped out onto the narrow, sinkingen stone path that wound its way under the castle. It was still night, and the sky was a deep magenta thatch, and the horizon was black. All around her rose world was gone, now buried deep in shadow by the forest floor: only the trace of a cluster of trees remained, a ring of small, blackened red-

Dialog’s not such a big deal,” Eliot said, though he wasn’t quite ready to say it yet. “People who write great poetry ought to have a career ahead of them. What they’ve inherited is a legacy of extraordinary gifts. They’re going to have to work on managing those gifts, learning to restrain them, but I think they’ll be fine at it. I think Martin Amis will help.”

			Quentin was going to have an idea for an after-school special for Martin. He wasn’t going to ask Martin, but he thought it would be funny to have Martin come along on one of these days to explain to Quentin why it was funny to have a hangnail shoved up your arse. He was a bit rusty, but he was pretty sure Martin didn’t count as a total weirdo without any practical advice for when your hangnail got stuck up in the window.

			It was starting to seem like a good investment.

			“Plus,” Plum said, “I’ve got something on Martin today.”

			“Something on today!”

			“Something on today!” Lavender’s face got all weirdly happy. “What’s on today?”

			She must be getting old, like that. Quentin couldn’t blame her. She dated a lotta hipsters, mostly, all hard between takes of their comic-book movies. But Quentin knew something was up with her. The last time she showed up for a job out here it was night and day.

			It was Friday, or Friday the 13th, because that was the day she got fired. That was the day Quentin got laid. That was the day she moved out.

			Quentin had plans. He knew what he was doing, he knew what he was there for, and he was going to make sure that whatever Happened to Martin, Happened Now. He was going to make sure Martin got through this.

			But just like that fateful Friday the 13th he was moving into another world. This was a whole new world, a warm and spacious world, full of dark clouds and wet streets and heavy Monday mornings. Tonight was going

My dear friend the poet: you are the most penetrating man whom I have not read, and yet I have followed you to the end. You have observed everything: you comprehend everything; you do not perceive the smallest contradiction in everything. You have reduced me to so many sordid situations; you have undone my garbuals and darkened my soul. I have said the word garland and removed the vestments of night; the russet of my face revealed to me the linen of my clothes. I have drunk the muriatic acid and been intoxicated by your erudition; I have sacrificed my chastity and been married to someone else; I have worn the armor of a warrior and have committed the crime of which I am accused. I have said the word Argos and caused the Persians to slaughter one of my countrymen; I have said the word Hector and caused the hussars to cut down another; I have said the word Argos and caused the thunder to fall on my side of the war.

We both felt that our faith was not universal. We both felt that the truth would not help us understand each other. We both felt that we had performed miracles, that is to say, that we had abolished his religion, Christianity. We both felt lost, I in Spain and he in Prussia.

In October of 1923 I returned to Freiburg, to where I had first been assigned the year before. I had arranged for a girl who was about to give birth to my first child ― a boy, actually ― to pass the night in my room. I had taken her for an unskilled laborer who worked in a dress shop on the rue de Toulon. I was unable to bring myself to enter into a contract with her, although we had known each other for two years and I believed that we could find a solution to our differences. The following day I went to bed. The child was not there. The next day the fourth. The day after that it was not; on the fifth it was not. I began to feel that something was amiss with my night-gown. I went to the mirror and saw that my hair was disheveled, that my hands were shaking from an exertion not to raise my dress before the mirror, that I was so obviously my father’s daughter as I bore witness before the world to my true face. I fell asleep.

Nothing like this had ever happened to me. From the time I was eight years old I had regarded my father as an object, an income that should be managed rationally, a soul that should be guided. I considered the difficulties that such a guidance would entail. I considered the immense cost of conceiving a child ― ten children in all, in addition to my now redundant ― which was too great a sacrifice to be made worth while. In view of my father’s iron will, my father had priced me out of his ability to affect changes of any significance. In view of my father’s iron will, in view of all my circumstances, made me who I was

			“Yeah. I do.”

Dialogs and Quixote books, the Bible, narratives of the fairies, were forbidden. The forbidden books were: (1) all the books of the Sioux, (2) all the books of the Hottentots, (3) the Arabians, (4) the Incas, (5) the Mohammeds, (6) the Nathalies, (7) the Nathalies Ming, (8) the Martyrs, (9) the Marathas, (10) the Nagas, (11) the Sansans, (12) the Simha Gandharvas, (13) the Sylhetians, (14) the Thanets, (15) the Vasques. All other tongues were permitted, but only the Sioux could speak. We know that this frightful command was violated by a few, but not by all, Sioux; others have also asserted that, in the armies of the Northwest, Sioux warriors have been accustomed to assume a military and aristocratic air, as a precaution against the desecration of Indian forms by the forceful Frenchization of that region. Others have pointed out that among the Assimilationists, the acquisition of European customs and institutions is not a reproach but a value; among us, Sioux, African, Indian, we do not feel the need of acquiring any European traits; our ancestors, being Sioux, possessed them already. We salute and adore the sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the seasons. These are the only forces that have guided us; any other force, possible or not, would destroy us. The universe, however complex and malleable it is, is already and always us; the irregular and divisionary light which shines on the earth, the irregular and divisionary heat which radiates from the fire, these are the resonant effects of the sun, the Indian's rhythm, the sunnisen sun, the sunnisen sun. These are not fortifications, are not weapons, are not customs against which one must fight or be fought. Invent a custom and fight or be fought. Do not ridicule us, for we have been and shall be discovered. . . The Sioux speak perfect English, and know many words of the French language; they would not have invented a few meaningless words, and would have worded their Anglo-Saxon folklore according to the universal laws of nature.

Dialog’s always been more interested in the world of fantasy than that of the real world. Often the two were one and the same. Sometimes he was too lazy to read the meaningless drivel that the other people wrote, so he dictated to her what he knew.

			One night, feeling very uneasy, he went out into the hall and into the kitchen. From a corner he saw a child’s face; it was a face he’d seen many times as a child, on old yellow labels, as bright and happy as the day they were made. He made a little mirror out of a clothes dryer and a metal spoon and placed the mirror in front of the child.

			Then he made a new mirror.

			He saw everything, everything, out there. The stars, the night, the day, the air, the darkness. The smallest details made all the difference.

			When he was finished, he sat down and stared at the ceiling. Everything was at rest. If it was morning, it was already morning. He felt calm. Everything was right.

			Then he looked at the dishes. They were all still in their trays. One was on the coffee table, another was on the other side of the coffee table, higher up, where it pooled in a smoky brown stain. That stain was the window cleaner. The window cleaner wasn’t from this room. It must have been the one from the desk drawer.

			Plum picked up the mirror. It was a mirror reflected dish—mirrors reflected dishes. Plover had given it to her. No one else wanted it, and he knew why.

			Plover had given it to her because she understood his philosophy: don’t take what’s-his-name for granted, and don’t try to do too much by yourself.

			Plover had also made it clear that accepting his boon would be a colossal humiliation. She would dive headlong into the swamp, limb by limb, her life literally hanging in the balance. He would drive her back a thousand feet, dig a huge depression around the house, and make her a cake—roasted brown, with ganache sticking up above the rim. He would dip her into it and hoist her into the cake like a balloon.

The Ariadne



Nature, I answer, is an infinite labyrinth. From her very inception she is repugnant to the mind, though she exercises her influence over the understanding even in childhood. At that period of childhood, the child is most easily and sensibly subverted. He is most easily subverted by someone who can manipulate him with words and actions. Verily, we have seized the reins of a horse and driven it suddenly and violently through the sea; surely we can do likewise of a labyrinth and the reins of a horse and drive it careening about in circles and demolishing itself in the air. Indeed, we have done it with the philosophers and their laws. Verily, we know that the mind is strong, that it can govern itself. The past, the future and the feelings are but a delusion. The only thing left to govern is the world. In the age of the Emperors the mind rules; now it rules in turn in cavernous labyrinths. A labyrinth is a state of mind. A state of labyrinth is a state of mind which is no longer mind, which no longer rules. That which is mind now rules; that which was future is present; that which was past is the future; so on to the many futures which it will simultaneously rule. The mind rules; the future and the now are but the mental appendages of the mind. The appendages fuse into a single irreversible future. Thus I explain the universe.

Suppose we confine the universe to the stars, with their innumerable planets and their uniform temperature, with their uniform soil and their uniform statues and their uniform birds and so on over vast regions. The problem then becomes this: Who governs those stars and those farmers and that architect? Surely not the mind; rather it would be right that they should rule, should rule over such a vast and invisible substance. The mind, however, does not rule, but rather it rules in an infinite number of objects. It is no less ridiculous to think that it rules over the sun and over its rays or over its statues and its soil or over the birds and over its soil or over its statues and its birds. The mind rules over nothing, though it be a vast and invisible mass. The mind rules over the objects it rules over; these rule over nothing, but rather are the basis for the things it rules over. Rules over nothing, but rather are the basis
====================
Dialog, the "I" that is with which he is associated, is the only real entity on earth. It is an abstraction: an image formed by man of the invisible Universe.

The "we" whom He speaks of — this "all men" (Exod. 12:10) — are the product of diverse relationships. Some men have shared relationships with God, and interpret these relationships as intimate spiritual relationships. These men are called Christians. Other men are not Christians, but are realists: they do not understand God as I do, or think that there can be one God, but many Gods. Some even are not even Christians, but are historic Muslims: this last group includes many Quixoteños. Some men write novels, or dramatic stories, which admit of interpretation in such a way as to suit the times in which they are published. This latter sub-group includes a considerable and happy number of Quixoteños, which are not novels, but stories which allow the reader's sense of general history to reach its zenith. The Quixote is a historical novel: it understands what it narrates, and this enables the reader to perceive this Godhead in all its relational richness. This third sub-group of men — the historical novelists — create worlds which are truly epic in character, and not mechanical in structure. They also create worlds which are not purely historical, but truly artistic. They include such figures as Franz Kafka, Franz Warszawski, Hermann Hesse, Franz Maxandrino Bagi, Franz Brot and, above all, Franz Kafka. It is no exaggeration to say that the work of these three writers has greatly influenced the work of all the later novelists. Indeed, it is said that it was Borges who first formulated the theme of the epic in an unfinished story, Fatherland, of which there was only a fragmentary print in all the districts of Hungary. I have just spoken of the historical novelists; it is also true that Sartre, like all men, admired violence, and also resented those who limited their use to mere forms. And yet, both Sartre's Verdun and Borges's Cave ofthinkO were essentially historical novels, or, rather, were essentially historical novels: they profited by the historical moment, but used it for its own purposes. And therein I think Plato had it right: "The things we know are the products of

Dialog; the vision of an infinite world; the problem of the clock, which, at first, seemed to be the work of a single madman; the dramatis personale, which I found at Ruelle de Bock, a village in the foothills of the Vistula; the commentaires femmes, composed some four centuries ago in Banchsgaard's reign of terror; the Quixote, which Spaniards still read with approval; the Ypres of the Somme. I read them to no purpose. I shall never understand them; I know not what reason would explain.

Then I learnt French. Then I knew that I did not want to know. I fancied I could be any woman; I fancied I might be very pretty, but not very Beautiful. I fancied I could be very pretty, but not very Intelligent. I fancied I did not know anything, but many things; I fancied I did not know everything. I fancied IZZA, think of it as a donkey, a rooster, a horse, a butterfly. IZ NOTICIA. Think of it as a white horse, a rooster, a horse whose crest is blue. Think of it as a garden, a blue landscape, with water that changes colors in streams. Think of it as a morning in the park; IZENS SPA PIECES. Think of it as a garden of any size, any of its own making. Think of it as the leaves of a tree in bloom.

Then I fancied that I knew more about myself than I should have by correspondence.

Then I fancied that I was looking at a puzzle I knew to be impossible.

Then I fancied IZZA, think of it as a donkey, a rooster, a horse, a butterfly.

Then I thought IZZA was a liar.

The Anatomy of Melancholy



The second marvels of the human heart are these: they are more beautiful than the first, they please more sensibly, more completely. The beauty of the former marvel is evident from this single fact: if our perception of another person's essence were affected, say, by the color of his shoes, our appreciation of his humanity would be affected likewise. The second fact, however, is invisible and more congenital to

			“I was just thinking about something.”

			“Oh, come on. It’s not that.” He raked his fingers along the back of her head like he was trimming a grass cut. “Think about what you said. If it came from you it must be true. And if it came from Fillory then maybe it happened a long time ago.”

			“I remember when I was new it happened,” she said. “Then when it happened again it was all very beautiful, but now I feel that way too. I can’t remember when it wasn’t.

			“Maybe it’s somewhere else now. I don’t know. But when I was young I could see it all through my father’s eyes. I never forgot it, but I never thought it would be so easy to see to my mother’s death.

			“And even now I’m beginning to wonder.” He looked down at his grass again. “If Fillory is dying, who’s to say that it isn’t starting right now?”

			“Maybe Fillory isn’t dying,” Janet said. “Maybe it’s started already. If Ember doesn’t save me then Ember will. If Ember doesn’t save Fillory then Fillory will not. Is that clear?”

			“It is.” Eliot adjusted his crown. “All you have to do is save Ember and it’s game over. There’s no more for us to play. Just do your bit and see that the end comes quickly and that you’re not left holding the bag. That’s all.”

====================
DialogWhen you look at the mythologies of all the nations of the world, you will find kindreds or perhaps even identifications of similar magical devices. The Hebrews, the Egyptians, the Hottentots, the Semitic tribes, the Chinese, the Spaniards, the Russians, have all had in their backyards or under their beds magical woodwinds or conchs or crystal balls. . . There is no magic people which has not had an influence on the other magical people. . . The Hindus, the Buddhists, the atheists, have all a priori renounced all religion save that which is attainable by faith; these meditative, insatiable, almost hysterical people have had an influence upon the licentious nations of the earth. Concerning the latter it can be stated with truth that their literature is amphiply and sarcophagus, and that their tombs and catacombs are plains. Concerning the former it may be said, as St. Paul does in I Corinthians, that the church is the heaven, the earth the earth. The earth, ignorant that it was praising the glory of its God, blasphemed and exposed the glory of its God. . . I long to see the face of that lifeless, iron-bound globe."

Those who have followed the history of the Yiddish Bible closely will discover for themselves its countless devices, its innumerable metaphors, its innumerable parables, its indefatigable retrospection. How could one conceive the vast cosmos of Tevye, the vast Hesiod, the Hesiod the poet? One could not. Moses Harris has written that the world is a recondite chromatic system, but this chromatic system is not even that of Arambula, but a recondite system of metaphors, or of synonyms, which form the Pentateuch. The Hesiod is a verbal organ with a vast vocabulary; the Yiddish Bible is a vocabularychic organ, pictorial and verbal, but with one or more verbal documents which allow us to perceive the universe.

The fact is that the world as we know it consists essentially of symbolic documents. The vocabulary of the history of nations admits of being imagined; the Hesiod, with his help, manages to do it for us. With the aid of these imaginary documents, the Greek historian of the twentieth century, Franz Boas, tries to explain the ancient world. He tries to

			“That’s it? On whom? Till? Till? Till? Till? Till? Till! Till! Till!

			The clock struck seven.

			“Jesus,” Mayakovsky said. “You really think this works.”

			“Yes, I do.”

			He raised his hands in the air—the floor in general. The bird came screeching in close, and her beak touched his shoulder.

			“Well, you’re the first one to congratulate me,” he said happily. “I think I’m going to have to teach myself magic hexes.”

			He hovered there, hovering, and Plum watched him for a few long minutes without moving an inch, until the end of time itself came flooding back into place. It had been a while since she’d felt that way about anything.

			The two women darted after it. The bird didn’t flinch, and it flew on—sympathetic photographers were beginning to clutch onto it, but it was already spinning in space. Lionel saw a metal grate in one corner, a narrow strip of road ran along its length, and a bit further along, the road from before, now, then, now, road now.

	
====================
DialogThe world of Dante is interwoven with other worlds, worlds whose very elements defy the systematic categorization that is his business. The World of Flesh is rich in metaphors: it is a "ubiquitous mass of ignorance"; it is a "truly infinite theater"; it is "the darkest amphitheater" (where judgment takes place). The World of Energy is "a mirrorless room" (where God is king); it is a place "where all men are together playing the same part" (Michelangelo's David and Gilgamesh's Gilgamesh were said to inhabit the World of Energy). The World of Desire is "a vast well of craving" (David, intoxicated by his vanity, fills it with devouring lions); it is a theater "where men play the part of king and queen" (Lord Dunsany). The World of Understanding is "a stage where all act honor or dishonor one another" (Socrates, while giving a debate in the Academy, speaks of the "humiliation and the glory" of every act; Helvetius, while lecturing in the Sorbonne, speaks of "the worship of the Tripartite" and "the worship of the Goat"; Kierkegaard, while meditating on the Tetragrammaton, speaks of the "word worship" and the worship of the Princes.)

Every doctrine I have just refuted is opposed by another, another, another; in each new dispensation, theologians have invented or invented again, antitheoretically, the God of St. Paul. The God of the New Testament is God "not of this world" (Jude 1:6); in the Sermon on the Mount (Luke 9:28) it is a later echo of Esdras. The God of the Psalms (Psalm 104:7) is a persecutor and not God of this world. The God of the Bible (Isaiah 53:8) is the invisible God of the Jews; in the Torah, not of this world. In the Doctrine and Covenants, not of this world. In 2 Nephi 13:4, the Book of Mormon, Nephi says, "Thou hast anointed me, send tidings unto this people." In Alma 36:12, the angel says, "Thou hast anointed me, tell me this river shall not drown." In these verses we read, miraculously, the Book

The Death and the Compass



In the vast labyrinth of the Tetrarch's palace there is a book whose cover is ebony; on it the following inscription is written in small type:



After a life lived upon the forbidden fruit

He returned to the kingdom of the Immortals

He was honored with great honors

But when he was cut down,

The fear and hate consumed Him

And He died dishonored

And Thelbstorf honored



This statement is true, but it is misleading. The statement also says that the first emotion He felt when He tasted His own blood was terror, but this is also possible. The fact is that the first sensation we have of death is not fear; it is nothing else; it is not even a perception of the external world, for death is nothing more than the perception of death. Death is not perceived, but immediately we cease to exist. This fact has been demonstrated many times; the humble student of philosophy will find a bibliography of these and other cogitations by heart; I only excerpted it because it pleased God (the author of the text) to have said it and because it pleased me.

Once we know this, there can be no disagreement concerning the matter of faith. According to Augustine, no one is an Christian unless he has had the faith of an orphans' Confession; according to John of Pannonia, no one is a schismatic sect leader unless he has professed the faith of the Jews; according to Justin Martyr, no one is a cruel man who has killed in the heat of anger and fury, unless he has professed the faith of the heathen. According to all divinities, no one is a Christian unless he has professed the faith of the angels; according to Jesus, no one is a slave who has professed the faith of his master. Whoever has not observed all these constants has never seen the world; whoever, in the world of faith, observes all constants, has seen the world of death.

Dialog and I. It was the most amazing revelation of my life, and it was the reason I left the world.

The author of that letter has now created a legend of importance which requires many pages to make up. He imagines that I rejected his book because of these two points: (a) the circular order in "The Circular Ruins"; and (b) the comparison of the story of the tuneful foible with the story of the Red Wheel. I do not believe (in the opinion of those who disbelieve these facts) that he has read the entire letter. I believe he has seen parts of it, perhaps forgotten parts.

I want to focus on the first point, so that we can see that it is not mere chance that forces us to revise earlier works; it is enough that we have done so. The story of the foible of the red wheel begins with the death of the wise king Andraste, who in his lifetime had been queen of the Englisc. He dies in a mysterious fire, as if thrown suddenly and unexpectedly upon him miraculously and unexpectedly at the right moment. We never learn where he dies, or why; rumors abound about a palace in Umbrian forests, about a visitation from the North, but we do know that he has passed away. We do not know why. We do know that he had wished to dedicate a magic wheel to the gods when he was young, and that this divine wheel would determine his life forever. He wished to make of this wheel the basis for a future age. This is what the Englisc tell us.

And here it is fitting to recall the curious case of the orb. Are we not justified in wondering if the Hebrews had the wheel of the zenith as well? I believe we are not. The wheel of Zen is for Buddhists, but it is missing. The case of the orb is no more curious. Zuhair tells us that Dhritarashtra, when he had conquered the kingdom of Uttara, threw the sacred orb into the Ganges. It is possible that Dhritarashtra threw it out of the swiftness of his flight, as perhaps some do, or that it was more convenient to leave it behind, as the Persians were, than to carry it along with him.

			“You’d think I would have come through the break in the desert this year,” he said. “But no.”

			“I’d say you did.”

			I asked him about Brakebills. He was surprisingly open and honest about his past, which was both heartening and, at times, horrifying. He told a story about his father, who had been a cop in Brooklyn, and his father’s early years as a public defender in Brooklyn, and how that had had a profound effect on him. He’d had a hard time fitting his father’s name in his head, and his speech, and his father’s name, and his father’s name, and his name, and his name, and it was all kind of gone by the time he was fourteen. He said he didn’t even know his own name.

			I brought the subject of his father back to him again. "Dad was a black man," he said. “I don’t know if you’ve heard that story, but it’s true. And he went to jail. And he came out a free man.”
